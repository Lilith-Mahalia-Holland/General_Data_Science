this article describes the development of the international ombudsman association uniform reporting categories by the uniform reporting categories task force from to
from the earliest steps of identifying core team and core categories based on previous typologies used in of offices the processes of broad and subcategory development are described
mechanisms for discussion and feedback over various iterations based on membership feedback and online surveys of acceptability and utility are considered
results of such surveys are presented
additionally persistent difficulties and questions in the development of cate gor is at ions are addressed
the uniform reporting categories version and version are attached
trouble with measurement is its anonymous the capacity of profession to represent the nature of the work it does to its own members and to outside observers is one of the defining characteristics of its professional maturity
indeed williams asserted success of this ombudsman profession will depend on the continuing evolution of its identity and the identity of its
an example of how identity is formative for professional evolution is the development of the diagnostic and statistical manual by the american psychiatric association
it was only with the development of the ds mi in the through to the in that the profession of psychiatry was able to move from discipline perceived as being fundamentally subjective albeit with disciplined though diverse professional developmental standards to an evidence based profession that could reliably explain its processes of diagnosis and hence enable standardised recommendations for treatment
from this early platform the professional development of psychiatry was to escalate with unprecedented speed supported by increasing sophistication in diagnostic processes matched by developments in psychopharmacology and development of complementary behavioural and social models alongside enriching critiques of psychiatry and its activities
the net result in the following decades to the present was the rise more coherent visible evidence based profession and continually higher levels of professionalism and training american psychiatric association
for organizational ombudsmen one of the for consolidating the professional identity and practice of the profession is the development of standardised reporting categories by which issues can be identified and logged in consistent manner across all the sectors in which the profession operates
using consistent reporting categories in this way brings number of potential advantages
for example it would tracking of the evolution of issues which ombudsmen address thereby possibly enabling conclusions about causality on organisational and individual levels and certainly enabling the charting of trends in ombudsman intervention both across time and basis for standard is ati on of professional responses to dominant themes and issues emerging from the data standard operating procedures and frameworks for identification of relevant training and research needs across the profession in response to themes and crises emerging from cross sectoral comparisons involving disciplined systematic and increasingly empirical approaches resulting in progressively reliable data bases
prior to this point and based on content analyses from informal discussions with ombudsman colleagues in all sectors it was clear that there were no prior uniform categorizations of issues being used
in fact requests by new ombudsmen for suggested categories could not be met because no ombudsman professional organization had developed such at ax ono my
further the underlying rationale often differed for the various schemes that did exist
for example one colleague tracked only the location of complaints within their organization while another used the chapter headings from their organizational staff rules
additionally offices reported that their own categories changed from year to year in an attempt to more accurately capture the issue trends
thus no long term charting of trends was possible
within this context in the then president of the ombudsman association toa john bark at in cooperation with the then president of the university and college om buds association andrea briggs convened uniform database categories task hereafter referred to as the task force to explore the possible development of standardised case categories across the main sectors engaging organisational ombudsmen
this paper aims to discuss the methods employed by the task force since that time to illustrate the results of the task work and to locate future development of the resulting reporting the context of discussions that have evolved from the work of the past four years
at the time of the formation of the joint uniform database categories task force in it was agreed that all core sectors of the toa and membership should be included higher education corporate government and international agencies complete task force membership since its beginning is reflected in the acknowledgements below
from that start frank brainstorming of possible content items was undertaken based on as haring of the categories being used in each of the offices represented and then review of thecate gor is at ions used in the offices of number of experienced colleagues
these steps were then followed by content analyses of the issues and an initial broad category grouping
while discussions within the task force on category groupings were ongoing inputs were regularly invited and received from the toa and membership particularly during the annual conferences of the toa and in tucson and atlanta and as in la and st louis
key element of the development of both broad and subcategories has been the piloting of the categories themselves and also the piloting of to actually use them
for example the joint toa and conference in tucson in and overlapping conference in atlanta in saw the distribution of the reference the updated list of broad and subcategories with the aim of encouraging feedback following testing by ombudsman offices
task force members had always recognized that for the classification system to be of value to colleagues the broad categories would need to represent the breadth of their work across sectors
in addition the underlying logic of the classification system would need to be obvious so that accurate placement of any issue question concern or inquiry would be evident to users of the system
toward that end between the overlapping atlanta conferences and the first annual conference in in la the broad category definitions were revised and reformatted for consistency
task force members also recognized it would not be possible to anticipate every subcategory needed by all colleagues across sectors
this recognition led to the idea that colleagues be encouraged to create their own subcategories as needed
however allowing this presented the potential for inconsistencies in placement of subcategories
to minimize this problem for the first time every subcategory was defined and examples were also included for each
in time for the first annual conference in la joll ain april the task force conducted an online survey of members to assess the utility of the then eight broad categories along with the willingness of the membership to use them by using their data from and cross matching them to the categories
in september the board of the approved and agreed to posting the task broad and subcategories on the web pages together frequently asked questions and answers on the reporting optional data elements that ombudsmen might find an example of six organisation cross sector comparison of data from undertaken by ombudsmen and mediators working in the un system in geneva and by other task force members using data from figure
in addition two page crib sheet was developed to provide convenient reference for ombudsmen seeking to make cate gor is at ions of the issues brought to them and to facilitate cross matching from prior taxonomies they may have been using
the online survey process was repeated for the conference in st louis in april
the io ase nt an email to the membership requesting that members complete the reporting categories online with their office data from
this request was posted in december on the members section of the web site
in addition the task force also offered to help recipients prior data categories with those the task force proposed
table illustrates how the broad category groupings evolved as result of the discussions and feedback from the annual conferences and from the experiences of individual ombudsmen offices
there have been many discussions and reasons given for every evolution of the broad categories but some brief examples may be illustrative of the range of considerations underlying the choices made
for example major change from to was the division of the category evaluation supervision and career into two broad categories progression and
it was agreed that such change was merited in order to increase the internal consistency of the categories for example evaluative relationships issues did not fit with issues concerning administrative procedures linked to recruitment job permanence and separation
increasing internal consistency of the categories would also ensure that analyses of data did not become distorted and early pilot testing also showed that each of the resulting broad categories was sufficiently large to merit such division see figure
the first cross sectoral comparison based on the categories as they had evolved from the la joll ame et ing was undertaken by geneva based colleagues in the united nations and related international organizations una rio network in the latter half of these comparisons were then expanded with data available from governmental and educational ombudsman offices and presented together to the board in september
the findings from this comparison are illustrated in figure
needless to say the pie chart comparison of broad category issues seen across offices gives an immediate view of how different offices have different emphases in categories of issues seen
key principle maintained by the task force was the need to observe the use of neutral language for subcategories particularly language eliminating any implication of decision by the ombudsman
additionally other dilemmas were continuously arising the challenging the task force for exam plea
what exactly should an ombudsman count of cases of different people assisted or of issues raised
for the purposes of reporting the task force decided an ombudsman should count the number of different concerns issues or inquiries
many choose to count the number of different people they assist or the number of as well
eventually the task force opted not to define at least two common definitions were recognized and were considered irreconcilable or unacceptable to all colleagues
these two different definitions are illustrated below
in some offices is all the work the ombudsman does involving the same situation
for example visitor initiates request for help about conflict with her supervisor over her performance evaluation and the ombudsman sees no one else about this matter that is one case
and if with the the ombudsman initiates contact with the supervisor or if the supervisor independently contacts the ombudsman and expresses concern about perhaps the poor response to the feedback he gave her about her performance it is still one case because the issue which resulted in the ombudsman having contact with both parties is the same
in some offices every different visitor who initiate sa request for help is considered separate if it is two people talking about the same incident whether from the same perspective or two
accordingly instead of defining the task force decided that in each of our nine broad categories we would use the phrase concerns issues to include all the matters about which ombudsman offices assist members of their organizations to discuss information andor options and for assistance in understanding managing or who decides how an issue will be categorized visitor or the ombudsman
and what should we do when conflicting parties define issues differently eg vs
the task force recommended that the issues or counted would only be those for which the ombudsman provides information or for which options are explored this solution became known as
should categories be developed based on the constituencies assisted or on the issues raised
of the nine broad categories developed by the task force seven are solely about the issues themselves
however two different types of interpersonal issues concerns etc
which appeared to the task force tobe qualitatively different from one another emerged from our discussions those involving peers colleagues and those involving eg where differences in formal power existed
as result two of the broad categories are defined according to the constituencies involved not necessarily the constituencies since we often speak only with one party involved in given situation
even here however all the subcategory choices focus on the issues about which those involved have questions concerns issues etc
one benefit of this approach is that it gives very quick overview of the number of issues etc
with which ombudsmen assist involving people with differences in formal power versus the number between peers
it was our conclusion that on balance conflicts between people where differential power exists involve greater emotional impact and higher stakes at least for the person in the lower power position than conflicts involving peer sd should we aim for simple classification system that colleagues can easily adopt and adapt or should we aim for standard comprehensive taxonomy to replace all others
from the outset it was recognized that many offices had preexisting taxonomies that might require some adaptation to enable clear transition to the task force recommended categorization or that would be preferred as basis for continued data collection
accordingly the task force recommendations are presented in the expectation that individual colleagues and offices will modify and add any of their own subcategories as they see the need
additionally we have offered to help colleagues do the cross matching from their categories and subcategories to the ones
with these qualifiers in mind we have asked our colleagues at the least to report to us in these nine broad cate go rie se should we be tracking only primary issues or allow for identification of primary secondary and tertiary issues etc
we decided to allow for the tracking of all issues about which an ombudsman provides information or about which options are discussed
we did not develop any method to indicate whether an issue etc
although we may review means for doing so in the fut ur ef should the task force also offer means of classifying the complexity or risk to the organization of the issues presented
we have not yet offered means of classifying the complexity or risk to the organization of the issues presented
however in addition to the reporting categories provided the task force has indicated ac om pen di um of possible data offices may consider collecting including indications of risk and complexity of issues the additional data elements are available on the task force web page on the web site
given the potential legal risks for an ombudsman andor their organization should the task force even be encouraging colleagues to track and report certain sensitive allegations such as
in an effort to provide mechanism to classify the issues concerns etc
with which we assist our constituents the task force decided to include certain more general subcategories such as and and not include further specificity
it was also decided that future versions of the categories reference sheet will contain explanatory language indicating that all issues concerns etc
categorized by an ombudsman are allegations not yet investigated and with are minder that ombudsmen do not conduct investigations or decide whether an allegation is true or false
additionally given our neutral role we wanted to be able to classify requests for assistance by those who had been informally accused of anything else and those who simply wanted information about how the policy and procedures were supposed to work
discussion an important limitation in the methodology employed in development of the uniform reporting categories is the small number of respondents and in relation to the total number of members polled approximately at the time of the surveys
despite this the reported experiences both through the two online surveys described and through practical application in ombudsman offices in numerous sectors have shown that employing standardised reporting categories is feasible acceptable to the majority of respondents and enables meaningful inter and cross sectoral comparisons of issues seen in ombudsman offices
although the taxonomy presented is comprehensive enough to replace most others some feedback suggests that resistance to adopting the new uniform issue categories may be based on the following concerns starting new process may lead to interruptions to data capture cost for changing their current database system or difficulties in making year to year comparisons involving prior taxonomies the flexibility of the current categorization process is not sufficiently understood or appreciated some may not understand how well categories could match up with their own preexisting approaches or that they can add their own subcategories what is used currently is really more precisely what they want and need in their particular sector or setting or some offices are unable to accommodate or appreciate the added value of changing their approach
the acceptability of andor resistance to the use of future versions of the categories reference sheet will be basis for future research by the task force
in order to ensure the relevance and responsiveness of the task force cate gor is at ions the current categories are being continually evaluated they are work in progress and subsequent yearly update is expected version of the categories reference sheet is attached following the latest inputs from users of version
the methodology for future revisions will involve the assembling of suggestions from members with agreed revisions being released annually as the version for that year and described at the annual conferences
the reporting categories are now included in training
this forum is also an ideal opportunity to explain the methodology of using the categories reference sheet particularly where confusions between or overlap of subcategories may arise
the categories reference sheet can be found on the web site along with instructions for participating in the annual reporting survey
version has recently been finalis ed following feedback from users of version
changes have been made to some subcategories in order to clarify points of potential confusion all broad categories have been retained
having the categories in relatively stable broad category groupings is crucial development but then having them in tracking software that can easily chart the development of trends while also allowing routine editing and changes to subcategories is the vital next step

although office usage issue identification and visitor demographics are relevant in assessing whether om buds are addressing organizational needs such information only begs the question of whether the services provided are up to standard
this paper suggests that scenario based performance assessment model is way of assessing om buds skills without compromising confidentiality
the author suggests that applications of this model may include local office and training and evaluation of om buds skills and explores possible application of the model to om buds certification
determining how best to evaluate whether an om buds office is doing good job is no small task
in view of the service goals of an om buds office it would appear that such an evaluation should assess not only whether the office is providing the amount and variety of services to its constituency for which the office has been created but also whether the quality of services provided meets the goals of the institution
further many om buds offices claim that they subscribe to the standards of practice of the international ombudsman association how do om buds offices assure themselves and their stake holders that they are performing up to such standards
om buds offices currently use variety of methods of measurement and assessment to hold themselves accountable to their stake holders and to identify ways to improve the delivery of om buds services
thus statistics concerning office usage demographics and visitor issues typically appear in annual reports and user satisfaction surveys are used to provide evidence that visitors are pleased with the services they received
what has remained challenge however is how to assess the quality of the problem solving process services aside from the subjective standard of user satisfaction
the problem solving process is the core function of an om buds office
om buds need way of assessing that such services are up to snuff
the purpose of this paper is to propose that om buds consider the value of scenario based performance assessment spa as method of both evaluating the efficacy of the services they provide and assessing whether they are operating up to standards of practice
this paper explores how the spa methodology may be used in om buds training and suggests possible application of the methodology for io ao mb uds certification
it is rarely the case that organizations and institutions are so financially flush that service units do not feel the need to justify their existence come budget time
although some om buds offices may feel that they have become so integral part of their organization that they are not compelled annually to assure stake holders that money spent on om buds is money spent well such offices are certainly the exception
many of the rest of us provide at minimum an annual accounting of the number and demographics of visitors served with the ubiquitous pie chart the kinds of services provided and issues addressed and our outreach efforts
constituency demographics and issue reporting provide valuable information about office usage issues of concern to constituents trends of concern to the organization and possible areas of future outreach
the annual report provides information that is valuable in helping stake holders to measure in some fashion whether an om buds office is addressing institutional needs
but of course the numbers and descriptors in typical annual report are of limited value in either evaluating whether the office is effectively serving its constituency or assessing whether an om buds office is operating up to io ast and ar ds of practice
many om buds offices employ user surveys to get visitor feedback in order to supplement the annual report numbers with qualitative assessment of their effectiveness with clients
there are however several wellknown limitations to the usefulness of exit surveys
one limitation is that response rates to visitor satisfaction surveys are notoriously low
and because of the confidentiality concerns of the om buds standards of practice mandates that holds all communications with those seeking assistance in strict it is difficult to conceive of manner in which failure to return the survey could be monitored and recalcitrant visitor could be encouraged to return the survey
also although it may be more likely that an office would receive greater number of returns if the surveys are completed close to the date of the office visit if surveys were requested immediately after an om buds ing session the questions posed may not return reliable information about whether the options identified by the om buds and the information provided were sound
in other words the user survey would in effect only measure short term client satisfaction
this is certainly valuable feedback about the manner in which we provide services to our visitors however it is of limited use in assessing whether our process was effective in helping visitors resolve their issues
visitor certainly deserves to meet with an om buds who treats him respectfully and helps him to feel
but how would visitor know if an om buds failed to spot an issue that was fundamental to successful resolution to the
how would visitor know whether the om buds operated up to standards of practice
the most direct and thorough way of assessing whether an om buds is providing services effectively and up to standard is by having trained observer observe the om buds in the process of providing services to visitors over period of time
visitors often come to om buds offices while under stress however and may not be open to the presence of an observer or may find it more difficult to confide when third party is present
further the process of evaluation may have to occur over an extended period of time in order to obtain large enough sample of case facts issues and personalities so that conclusions concerning the skills would be well grounded
real life observations present other challenges
there is always the risk that the evaluation of an office mate may be skewed by peer bias and other relational issues
on the other hand if the evaluation is conducted by person from outside of the om buds office it can be argued that the confidentiality privilege is waived
spa provides model that permits observation of an om buds officer in the process of providing problem solving services without visitor discomfort or running afoul of confidentiality concerns
spa can incorporate standardized case situations so that skills can be tested on variety of issues that commonly arise in the organization with standardized assessment benchmarks and qualitative feedback
the author conceives of spa as method that would assess om buds issues potting problem solving and interpersonal communication skills using who present with issues typical of the visitor population
the interaction between an om buds and simulated visitor would be assessed against predetermined performance benchmarks and would include feedback on om buds ing style and other intangibles
performance based assessment of clinical interaction under simulated conditions has been productively used in the medical arena
the performance based assessment program in the carver college of medicine at the university of iowa developed by dr george berg us and ellen franklin provides an instructive model the program assesses the clinical and communication skills of rd and th year medical students at the carver college of medicine
by having students interact with standardized patients sps in minute encounters medical faculty are able to assess medical students according to the objectives set forth by the college and its clerkships
this form of authentic assessment supports the objective that all our students will graduate with demonstrated competency in the areas needed by physicians starting residency training
the program also provides faculty with means of assessing the areas of strength and weakness in the medical school curriculum
our sps are not true patients but rather they simulate patient case that may have been seen in the clinics or on the wards in the hospital
previous research with practicing physicians aswell as with students shows that the performance learner or physician demonstrates in this setting is highly correlated with actual performance in real clinical setting
broad range of skills can be given focus during an assessment
cases can be tuned to specifically focus on interpersonal patient education or professionalism
university of iowa carver college of medicine the carver college sp is carefully trained to apa tie nt with the accompanying history physical findings personality emotions and behavior appropriate for the specific cases
university of iowa carver college of medicine such standardization permits that each medical student can be assessed with the same patient and problem
if faculty member wants to assess the competency of students faced with patient with abdominal pain the program can create such case
in that way all students can have that experience without having to wait for such apa tie nt to check into the hospital
performance based assessment under simulated conditions appears as desirable and well warranted in the om buds arena as it is in the medical field
properly designed spa can be geared to competencies according to individual om buds program and objectives
the use of trained would eliminate the issue of confidentiality and would permit an evaluation of targeted skill and information sets in way that allows assessment between om buds on the same criteria so that proficiency would be scale able
and upon positive assessment an om buds would demonstrate competency in the skills of core concern to the profession in manner that could be open to scrutiny
the possible applications of spa are wide ranging and significant
the fact that an om buds has passed ast and ar di zed assessment of om buds ing skills could serve as an important indication of effectiveness to organizational stake holders which could support office credibility and assist with office funding efforts
om buds skill certification using spa could enhance the public confidence in the om buds profession and provide some basis for legislative support for om buds privilege legislation
it would also appear that spa or spa scenarios can be used as at raining tool both in om buds office settings and as apart of education and skill building training programs
identifying the benefits of spa is of course only the beginning of the inquiry
before spa can be used in om buds evaluation there are number of complex issues to work through with respect to the construction of suitable scenarios and the administration of the assessment process
because as discussed above the spa can be employed for different purposes and the complexity and nuance of an spa administration will certainly vary according to the purpose of the assessment or training it is difficult to generalize about necessary program components
the purpose of this paper is to introduce concept and not to present working model however let me suggest some considerations that may help in framing an effective spa program
what om buds skills do we want to assess
before scenarios that mean anything can be generated we must first establish what behaviors skills and qualities we are looking to assess for proficiency
from review of the literature for example ro we and number of om buds web sites the author assumes for purposes of this paper that the kinds of om buds ing skills necessary for an om buds proficiently to discharge his duties include skills likely to elicit useful information from the visitor including listening skills being alert to both verbal and behavioral cues and issue spotting which requires that the om buds has base of information about the organization applicable laws and policies and human nature to put the information from the visitor in context skills in identifying options including analytic and creative thinking which again requires that the om buds have an information base within which to put the information in context and skills in communicating information to the visitor
the author would further suggest that an assessment of om buds proficiency should measure whether the om buds discussed information concerning om buds office functions and characteristics consistent with standards of practice esp
confidentiality and impartiality and whether the om buds operated in the session consistent with such standards
scenarios can then be designed to test whether an om buds presented with fact pattern that would arise in the organizational setting eg an academic om buds being visited by student who alleges that the student was being bullied by faculty member exercises the appropriate skills proficiently
the scenario can be constructed to raise certain issues in the opening narrative but keep certain issues unspoken until effectively probed by the om buds
the sv could be trained to display certain behaviors or drop certain verbal clues that proficient om buds should know to probe with followup questions
the broad behavioral categories would need to be refined into more specific subsets of behavior and determinations made concerning the benchmarks that represent finding of proficiency in the context of the given scenario eg what issues should have been spotted given particular visitor narrative what options eg referrals to policies or resources should have been discussed with the visitor if particular issue had been spotted
aside from assessing om buds behavior against skill level expectations and goals spa observations may also provide helpful feedback concerning the effectiveness of an approach and interpersonal style in dealing with different visitor personality and character traits
assume that we now have number of scenarios created and benchmarks set with respect to targeted skill sets
how should the spa be administered
who should administer the assessment protocol
in order to assure accountability of the process it would appear that optimal administration of the spa would include the participation of fully trained independent sv and venue that would allow observation or video recordation of the assessment session
obviously this kind of setup would not be feasible in most situations and spa administration can be adjusted to suit the purpose and formality of the assessment
ideally an sv would be carefully trained as in the carver college model to portray visitor the accompanying history personality emotions and behavior appropriate for the specific cases
this training would appear particularly critical to an spa program designed for purposes of certification to assure that all om buds undergoing testing be subject to the same set of sv traits and case information
because an spa assessment is highly interactive th es vs would require sufficient mock encounters in the training process to assure that the sv knows his character and issues thoroughly enough to deal with different lines of om buds questioning
ideally also the facility in which the assessment takes place would allow for video recordation of the session andor observation one way mirror and note taking by an evaluator skilled in om buds work
in training situation video may provide valuable feedback to the assessed om buds concerning the style and other intangibles
in certification program the video may serve as record test results and an internal tool in refining scenarios and other aspects of the certification process
life is rarely ideal however and om buds financial resources are not generally at level where dedicated facility or thoroughly trained actors is an option
in such situations assessment checklists may be provided to trained to greater or lesser extent sv which the sv would use to record the om buds performance after the assessment session
it is also possible that spa om buds assessment would attract sufficient interest to entice third party assessment operations to take on spa assessment on site as fee for services endeavor
the services provided by om buds offices are not adequately measured by simple output data
although office usage is of course relevant to the issue of whether we are addressing organizational needs office usage figures only beg the question of whether the services we are providing to our constituencies are quality services
we need to have way to assess our process
we need to see whether we are walking the walk
spa permits the assessment of om buds work in way that simulates real life without compromising claim to confidentiality
there are many obvious challenges in implementing an om buds spa program and much discussion needs to occur with respect to every level of the formulation and administration of such program
properly implemented however spa promises to provide way not only to help individual om buds offices improve om buds ing skills but also to lend credibility to the profession
it is the hope that this paper will begin the discussion
the uniform reporting categories task force is in the final stages of designing model to rationalize the categories of issues dealt with by om buds offices so that statistical information can be gathered which will be useful to and its members
at least one om buds office has also engaged in assessing its operations using compar ables comparison and has evaluated whether the structure of its office reflects appropriate standards and criteria in the literature concerning om buds operations based evaluation report
this paper does not address functions of an om buds office beyond the work done with individual visitors eg providing upward feedback on trends and systemic issues and acting as an organizational change agent
generously staffed om buds offices may handle an umber of cases in teams
in situations of team om buds ing however both om buds are participating and any involvement may affect the ability of the evaluator to give full attention to the other
further to the extent that the om buds share the problem solving duties the participation of the evaluator does not provide an opportunity to observe whether the evaluated party would have made that contribution if he were the only person present
it thus appears likely that peer feedback in team om buds ing situation would be limited in scope and utility
carver college draws its sps from the university and community at large
many of the sps have extensive acting experience
the actors are paid small hourly fee
university of iowa carver college of medicine obviously this would work if an office had several om buds and the head of the office coordinated the assessment efforts including the sv training

responses to survey of members emphasize the importance of skillfully and reflectively adhering to standards of practice
sops are stressed as instrumental to building ombudsman credibility and effectiveness over time
this article shares some of the survey highlights and themes including the greatest challenge reported by respondents hostility from those who have maintained ahistorical ly abusive working environment with as pe cif ic look at workplace bullying
the complexity of ombudsman response is demonstrated through case study application of relevant sops
the authors hope this article will serve as springboard stimulating global dialogue that continues to inform sound and skillful ethical practice impact fully addressing the most troubling of institutional concerns
last spring with author support author er be received permission from the international ombudsman association hereinafter board of directors to question its membership regarding internationalization
using electronic mail all were invited to join the survey
thirty four members responded providing rich anecdotal description of their practice and perspective
in contrast to io am embers hip survey response is relatively equally divided between those practicing outside and those practicing within the us fifty three percent of the respondents practice outside the states the remaining forty seven percent within
thus even though survey response cannot be used to membership as whole it provides an early window into perspectives and practices around the world
our purpose in writing this article is to share some of the most significant reports from last survey while demonstrating and examining their assertions through applied case study analysis
since many survey respondents stress standards of practice hereinafter several are introduced in detail
challenges arising from application of the sops to real world case study facts are identified and analyzed
an in depth and comprehensive exploration of the complexity and challenges of applied ethics is quite ambitious and beyond the scope of this article
we hope though to stimulate and encourage io alea der ship and readership in few significant ways sparking dialogue about how can act to create safe spaces that encourage members to honestly raise ethical doubts dilemmas and challenges with trusted and respected members modeling basic applied ethics through case study analysis and encouraging continuing publication in the journal that emphasizes sops and case study analysis with international even column where readers can contribute case study challenges that rotating group of members analyze with diverse rationale and experience
if nothing else we anticipate and hope that members are curious about what was reported by survey respondents and interested in learning whatever they can about the irrelatively new global community

the comparatively recent organizational ombudsman model is but one of many models
few common variations include ombudsman defined by the international ombudsman yearbook as independent office traditionally appointed by the legislative branch to investigate poor administration of government advocate ombudsman eg long term care or prison ombudsman whose primary function is to advocate for the rights of particular constituencies and news ombudsman who according to the organization of news ombudsmen web site
receives and investigates complaints from newspaper readers or listeners and viewers of radio and television stations about accuracy fairness balance and good taste in news coverage and recommends appropriate remedies or responses to correct or clarify news reports
howard gad lin ombudsman at the national institutes of health has observed the proliferation variety of ombudsman models in different sectors performing distinct functions and serving myriad constituencies has to confusion in the general public about what an ombudsman is and they have also engendered considerable amount of disputing among ombudsmen gad lin
this confusion exists both within and outside the united states hereinafter eighty percent of the more than six hundred members are from the us of the remaining twenty percent many hail from countries where classical ombudsman tradition exists
few live and work in countries with no tradition of om buds ing of any kind
as noted above the sops apply only to the organizational model of om buds ing
eighty five percent of those completing the survey of io am embers self identified as om buds
desire and need to avoid the aforementioned widespread confusion about various ombudsman approaches explains why many survey respondents indicate that consistently acting with integrity through practicing in accord with sops represents their source of power and protection
survey response particularly emphasis on the importance of honoring sops has inspired and shaped this article
survey reports as introduced above sixty two percent of respondents relatively equally divided between international organizations transnational corporations universities and colleges and other varied organizations repeatedly stress the importance of professional integrity through strict adherence to
as explained by one steadfastness in ethical behaviors garners essential respect
several survey respondents reiterated the importance of ombudsman independence
to that end fifty five percent of the survey respondents indicate that they follow what they perceive tobe regarding selection of an office location
forty four percent of survey respondents go on to stress the importance of clarifying the organizational role as compared with other organizational offices like compliance and human resources
only then can their community actually appreciate the distinctive independence within their organization
twenty four percent describe publishing their limitations for all to see and otherwise trying to educate each visitor about ombudsman independence
with the aim of achieving actual structural independence more than one survey respondent reported they have no other organizational role or any decision making power including committee service no one commanding them no socializing with those in power outside of official business and no reporting obligations
some describe an office charter or organizational code that stresses sops and lifetime appointment or tenure as well
fifty five percent of survey respondents identify confidentiality as the of our practice the very reason organizational members dare to contact the ombudsman and feel safe disclosing risky survey
in the words of one is probably the single most important factor in bringing people to my door in the first place
without it would likely gather do should be conducive to building trust in the survey
hostility from internal people in historically abusive environments is named by more than one survey respondent as the organizational challenge
in the words of another respondent this tough task involves the obvious disconnect between rhetoric about the importance of respect for human dignity with the apparent absence of sanctions against senior staff who flout rules and standards of civilized behavior and make the lives of their subordinates survey
as explored in detail later in this article principled commitments to confidentiality informality and neutrality may restrain and even prohibit direct disclosure of specific complaints to leadership depending on the circumstances
in the face of systemic abuse disclosure may be met with apathy or worse further hostility depending on leadership
in such cases recalling mary definition of the organizational ombudsman the role as change agent may be the only one that can be ethically exercised
sixty two percent of survey respondents name as their most important contribution describing it in myriad ways acting as an early warning mechanism providing upward feedback alerting leadership to emerging trends patterns and systemic issues through unfiltered feedback monitoring organizational climate identifying practices that hinder organizational systems and recommending changes survey
in cases where an ombudsman is prohibited from sharing the concerns of specific department due to risks involving confidentiality informality and neutrality the ombudsman can still attempt to identify receptive leadership and persuade them to do climate survey regarding bullying and harassment as one example or otherwise bring attention to the importance of taking its organizational pulse around these issues
survey respondents describe their ability to facilitate brainstorming of alternative approaches to problem as an essential catalytic role
organizational ombudsmen have golden opportunity to model their ability to generate explore and evaluate effective options whenever they face tough ethical issue or dilemma like the ones presented here
impartiality in action survey respondents name building the conflict management capacity of their organizations through training and coaching as their second most important role survey
they recommend the support and buy in of top leadership or working hard to build sufficient trust long before challenges like those described here arise
as one respondent said have no coercive power
our power comes from our ability to persuade to act quickly and to take on what no one else
leaders must be educated about io as ops and the reasons behind them specifically how honoring them will serve the organization so that they will understand the reasons for not pressuring ombudsmen into compromising activities or misperceive ombudsmen as betraying the organization with their disclosures
ongoing dialogue with leaders at all organizational levels is vital if the ombudsman can find way to proceed without violating confidentiality
some of the circumstances described later in this article involve the challenge reported by survey respondents as approaching the right level of leadership
developing resilient credibility with top leadership is particularly important in preparing to give authority feedback about their own negative contributions or otherwise say
in the words of another survey respondent is difficult to do unless you have built up trust and confidence over time
requires exquisite interpersonal sensitivity and communications skill to say to those in power in way that does not damage your reputation and to give those in power critical feedback about their own negative contributions to in way that does not alienate
at the same time survey respondents commend moral courage
one goes so far as to say this profession requires person with solid moral backbone that is willing to take risks but can also have high levels of empathy and flexibility
one way to address our anxiety is to have good alternative outside of your position good bat na
this does not mean that the ombudsman should be reckless
they should respect the right that officials have of
however the ombudsman should not shy away from providing feedback even if it is dissenting voice
all this should be done while keeping confidentiality and respecting right of self determination survey
of course relationship building must also be done with requisite neutrality
ombudsmen must constantly model what many call multi partiality or commitment to the best interests of and fairness to all
if done over time the risk of misperception that an ombudsman is aligning with or advocating for ap articular side will diminish
one survey respondent recommends vigilant awareness of assumptions others might be making when assisting them in viewing events from variety of perspectives so that the organizational ombudsman can quickly correct misunderstanding
another acknowledges the ever present challenge of being accused of taking sides when challenging parties to seek understanding of the other side but reports that seeking feedback from all those concerned regularly assures him that he is effectively and ethically navigating the challenge
neutral does not mean being shy
make the point because have ombudsman are hiding behind being neutral or keeping survey
while the do not answer all questions confronting organizational ombudsmen they provide guidance about many areas to assist practitioners in recognizing what is expected
they are especially helpful in identifying limitations for ombudsmen
in this section we first discuss few standards stressed by survey respondents neutrality independence and confidentiality exploring some concrete ways ombudsmen satisfy these standards through choice of office location and not identifying office contacts or requiring signatures in records
we then describe ac om plex case study example which allows us to demonstrate and discuss several survey anecdotes
all relevant sops are introduced and analyzed in factual context and options for satisfying sops are raised with underlying interpretation and rationale
we attempt to show the actual thinking and questioning or reflective practice of at least one ombudsman inaction as he considers the ethical issues arising from ap articular set of facts and his options for proceeding in accordance with all relevant sops
in the case study presented obvious challenges include listening from neutral perspective while responding to alleged and actual bullying
ensuring independence one choice facing any organization considering establishing an organizational ombudsman office is where to physically locate the office
although no particular standard directly addresses where to locate an office sop suggests one important underlying consideration ombudsman is designated neutral reporting to the highest possible level of the organization and operating independent of ordinary line and staff structures
some campuses prefer to house the om buds office in the administration building close to the in order to enhance the perception of the influence
however this location can inhibit users who have concerns about administrators or who do not wish administrators to know they are using the om buds office
and location in an administration building can also be perceived as limiting the neutrality and independence
ideally om buds offices should be located in space that allows visitors to enter and leave with minimum of visibility fe ni li and sag en
only when office location supports actual neutrality and structural independence does it satisfy and
one office at large us university is mixed use building near but not in the administration building
today this building includes the office of victim assistance and office of disability services which serve all constituencies the employee assistance program which serves faculty and staff and various academic support services for students
the office is located on an upper floor of the building near stairwell and elevator which allows visitors to enter and leave quickly without being seen by many people
the windowless door to the office is kept closed to allow visitors an added degree of privacy
this location away from executive offices in building where variety of services assist diverse constituents enhances the perception of both neutrality and independence and its easy access reduces the likelihood of being observed by others as well
following principles of confidentiality leads organizational ombudsmen to practice differently from other conflict resolution practitioners
very clear illustration of this difference is in the area of record keeping practices
one specific sop related to confidentiality sop directs organizational ombudsmen to avoid keeping any records that identify users of an office
for organizational ombudsmen this sop applies when they facilitate or mediate conversations between disputants
in contrast some mediators keep signed to forms in which disputants agree not to call the mediator as aw it ness should any formal process eg grievance or litigation occur
in fact according to the state of massachusetts web site presenting the general laws of massachusetts mediators must keep these forms for confidentiality protections to apply
the case study that follows using fictional names provides illustrations of how ombudsmen use some of the sops to guide their choices and in the process educate others within their organizations about the sops
after introducing some basic facts the case study discussion responds to the survey reports given earlier and follows their basic organization emphasizing with the challenge and complexity of ethical response to alleged and actual bullying beginning with discussion of referrals to and relationships with formal institutional channels and proceeding to the challenge of impartiality inaction with particular look at challenges faced in discussions with management
what becomes obvious is the importance of the ombudsman role in creatively envisioning and exploring options as well as encouraging visitors to do the same
carefully reviewing consequences helps visitors simultaneously evaluate their best alternatives
the ombudsman role in conceiving and coaching with an emphasis on viable options is equally key to conversations with management particularly when abuse within the organization has historically been allowed
open ethical dialogue with trusted and seasoned peers is foundational for increasingly expanding the ombudsman repertoire with the toughest of concerns
the reader might feel challenged at various points with tying all relevant concerns to appropriate sops
this real world case study analysis shows how applied ethics requires spiral logic often within networks of relevant and potentially relevant sops
the authors recommend that readers keep list of sops handy as checklist for their daily ethical analysis and reflective practice
they may also benefit from developing habit of writing out the facts presented to them in any given situation with enough space to write out possible and actual ethical issues questions to be explored options consequences and their related ethical framework
this can all be done without identifying information and the material can be shred when no longer needed
staff member named leonard made an appointment to speak with the ombudsman thaddeus to discuss what he described as pattern of abusive treatment by his supervisor miriam
leonard explained that he has worked for the organization for nine years and for the first four years he was in job class that offered limited annual raises but some degree of job security
the program assistant position in office offered much better salary and great benefits but no job security whatsoever
despite the warnings he received from three different people who knew miriam he wanted the raise and thought to himself can work with anybody
he accepted the position in her small office
perfect hindsight leonard explained now believe this was the worst decision ever made
leonard told his story he expressed pride in the fact that his nearly five years under supervision was far longer than anyone else had ever lasted in her office
before the end of the first year he said he had both witnessed and personally multiple times
since working with miriam leonard learned that many different people had filled and then left both his position and the administrative assistant position in her office
in fact two administrative assistants had transferred or quit during time and the latest one was already looking for another job after less than nine months on the job
additionally he said more student assistants had come and gone than he could remember
according to leonard sometimes apparently dependent on her mood miriam would target individual staff members for months at time and speak to them in hostile threatening humiliating and demeaning manner sometimes in front of other staff
he said she sometimes interpreted routine questions from staff members or student assistants as challenges toher authority and her tone of voice would convey that she was displeased with the question and the questioner when she replied
also he said she reacted to small mistakes as though they were gigantic failures
in contrast leonard reported that miriam was as toward her own supervisor jim who was very high in the organizational structure and whose office was in different building about aquarter mile away
leonard provided several examples to illustrate why he believed behavior was
letter had been mailed to the top fifteen managers and officers in the organization informing them of some upcoming events
apparently one of the student assistants did not know that one of the officers had moved to different office and used an incorrect address on the envelope
when staff member called miriam to inform her of the error and ask that her records be updated to reflect the change miriam huffed into office and got to talk about your ineffectiveness as supervisor right now in front of student assistant
she also interrupted his explanation excuses
want you to call that office and apologize for your mistake right let it happen again
last year after automobile accident miriam refused to sign an employment verification form sent by the insurance company saying leonard might be somehow it against the organization
had to call the human resources department and ask an administrator there to contact miriam and explain this was routine and ask that she complete the form
upon returning from sick leave miriam accused leonard of falsifying his time sheet
when they reviewed it carefully together it turned out to be accurate
upon discovering this miriam simply and left without making any apology to leonard for making the accusation
when leonard inadvertently left his caps lock on in responding do to routine email request from miriam miriam accused him of angry hostile and unprofessional
leonard immediately apologized by email and explained about his inadvertent oversight miriam responded trust you are clear about the expectations for professional communications in the future
said this most recent email exchange was the proverbial that broke the that led him to contact thaddeus for help
he said he now gets nervous walking toward his office every morning and his heart beats faster and palms sweat when miriam walks into his office
he said he increasingly found himself replaying incidents with miriam in his head while he was at home in the evenings and on weekends
he also reported that he has begun to notice that he is drinking more wine in the unwind
although he said his performance evaluations have been above average he said he is now sure miriam wants to fire him
he described himself as latest target
thaddeus listened to leonard he periodically paraphrased or summarized the details and confirmed with leonard that he accurately understood what leonard was saying eg if understand correctly when miriam raised her voice and questioned your ability as supervisor you felt humiliated and this feeling was amplified for you because the student assistant you supervise witnessed the interaction
occasionally he asked leonard open ended questions eg would you have liked for miriam to tell you about her concerns
this approach seemed to build rapport with leonard encouraged leonard to elaborate and simultaneously allowed thaddeus to verify that he indeed understood the situation
it also clarified the gap between actual behavior and how leonard would have liked for her to behave toward him
when leonard finished telling his story thaddeus said sounds like your working relationship with miriam has been painful and frustrating for you leonard
how were you hoping might be able to help
said have reached the end of my patience with her abuse
not paid enough to tolerate this and have to
want to find another job preferably somewhere else in this organization
until ido want miriam to leave me alone
and want someone in authority to confront her and make her stop abusing the people she supervises including me
was hoping you could help me review options about how might make these things happen
did not believe it would be safe or fruitful for him to communicate with miriam about his with or without the help of facilitator or shuttle diplomat
although he knew he wanted to find another position in his current job class since there were relatively few positions lateral transfers were rare
leaving the organization or returning to his previous job class would almost certainly require as ign if ic ant pay cut
as single dad this was close to unacceptable
however leonard said he would even take pay cut if he had to in order to get away abuse
after discussing various ways leonard might identify transfer opportunities thaddeus asked leonard who in position of authority he thought might be appropriate to notify
they discussed of the pros and cons of notifying various people
leonard said that even though jim held position near the top of the organizational hierarchy there had been good deal of turnover in his position in recent years and jim was fairly new
further although leonard said jim seemed like nice man he expressed doubts about and ability especially being so new in the position to deal effectively with miriam
and while he barely knew jim leonard said he had had an umber of positive interactions with pablo who was the second highest level executive in the entire organization
he thought pablo was apers on of integrity and despite his high level position in the organization in relation to leonard thought pablo might be willing to meet with him
leonard said he might also ask pablo about other possible positions within the organization for which he might qualify
leonard thanked thaddeus for listening and said it had helped him decide how he wanted to proceed
number of situations ombudsmen are likely to face involve serious challenges to following the sops
one such example involves the ombudsman who after hearing the same or similar stories from an umber of constituents decides to speak with someone in the management about as up er visor who has allegedly been engaging bullying
on the circumstances and people involved in this situation the ombudsman could find it difficult to maintain independence neutrality impartiality andor confidentiality
for the purposes of this article the authors assume that the case study facts reported above involve workplace bullying
uncertain is whether this bullying has gone on due to toughest challenge reported by survey respondents with institutional apathy tolerance of abuse and even collusion
regardless the ethical challenges explored below would arise
although leonard did not indicate whether he was aware of it he was not the first of supervise es to visit the ombudsman office expressing concerns about her behavior
two other employees had complained to thaddeus in the previous four years aswell
one of them cried while describing how miriam had treated her
both of them wanted help in learning how to cope with what they described as while they looked for another job
like leonard neither of them wanted to communicate with miriam either directly or with the help of af ac il it at or about their concerns
both were extremely fearful that she would if she found out they had been to the ombudsman office to talk about her
as result neither was willing to allow thaddeus to contact miriam or anyone else their concerns
given the small size of it was clear to thaddeus that he needed to adhere to sop which requires that the of those who approached the office for help
it was never clear how he could also follow sop by simultaneously on to management that included this apparent problem
the ombudsman office can always track conversations as part of its regular organizational statistical data collection perceived and potentially true bullying
when an ot ew or thy trend emerges organizational leadership can be made aware of the need to respond systematically and does not have to depend on individual initiative or risk taking to address important concerns
one survey respondent takes her annual report and dialogues with all constituencies
thus all stake holders can be conscious of and take responsibility for rectifying significant troubling trends
further the ombudsman can discuss with institutional leadership the importance of noticing high and unusual staff turnover as needs be examined in depth and on case to case basis to ensure competent and humane management throughout an organization
despite these change agent options however living with the knowledge that people in unit may continue to face ongoing abuse and not telling anyone about it felt to thaddeus as though he was not functioning effectively
the ombudsman can always decide to refer those involved to formal channels or at least carefully review all available options and their distinctions with visitors
survey respondents recommend developing trusting relationships with formal organizational members survey
sop indicates investigations should be conducted by others
some people visiting an ombudsman will insist on using formal procedures because they want to establish record of complaint and perhaps because they want sanctions to be administered
depending on the circumstances and the interests of visitors ombudsman referrals to those who conduct formal investigations are entirely appropriate for these individuals
for example employees with grievance rights or in jurisdictions with safety standards providing legal redress with injury from hostile work environments may prefer touse their legal rights to address issues such as workplace bullying
further when employees believe they are being bullied because of their protected class status eg race gender religion etc
they can make formal complaints alleging discrimination on this basis
ideally referrals can be made both ways between those who administer formal investigative procedures and ombudsmen
when an employee is open to or even appreciative of the opportunity for an informal resolution to her or his concern andor wants any future conversations to be confidential referral to an ombudsman is appropriate
significant challenge ombudsmen face in some organizations is from non ombudsmen whose work overlaps with the work of the ombudsman office
this can lead to territorial disputes and role confusion
one specific group with whom overlap is likely is the human resource hereinafter department
whose responsibility is it to assist employees who are experiencing conflict the ombudsman or the hr professional
in truth as introduced above either and both might be able to assist
if the ombudsman is following the sops the approaches of the two offices will likely be quite different
no records will be kept by the ombudsman
records including names and other identifiers such as dates are usually required for the hr professional
while the ethical and conscientious hr professional will maintain confidentiality as much as possible the contents of the conversation would not be confidential upon requests for information by her or his own supervisor or from the legal counsel
the conversation with the ombudsman on the other hand will be completely confidential unless the ombudsman perceives risk of serious sop
in the event the employee filed formal grievance or initiated disciplinary action the hr professional may very well direct the formal process and in the event of litigation if asked by the legal counsel she or he will almost certainly testify
in contrast if legal counsel respects sops she or he would not even ask the ombudsman to testify
if the employee asks the ombudsman to provide testimony in grievance or lawsuit the ombudsman will resist if she or he is following sops
another important and potentially thorny exists between the ombudsman and legal counsel
while legal counsel can advise the ombudsman about various policies or legal requirements it is essential that they agree not to contact the ombudsman to ask about confidential communications involving the ombudsman
this is avery unusual situation for legal counsel because normally everyone within an organization including top management cooperates with their requests for information
it would be very easy for legal counsel to view an refusal to do so as evidence of disrespect or arrogance by an individual ombudsman
clearly it would not be in interest for the legal counsel to have this impression
following neutrality and confidentiality means it is just as inappropriate for ombudsmen to talk with legal counsel about the details of their work with visitors as it would be for them to talk attorneys
ombudsmen anticipating these differences and potential problems with both hr and legal counsel and initiating communications with them before these issues arise however can establish good working relationships
fortunately the american bar association aba has been increasingly interested in and supportive of the ombudsman role in recent years
the standards for the establishment and operation of om buds document on the aba web site explains the ombudsman role its confidential nature and differentiates organizational ombudsmen from other types of ombudsmen
providing at least the section of this document on independence impartiality and confidentiality to an attorneys can be very helpful
an ombudsman must help her or legal counsel understand why the neutral and confidential ombudsman role means she or he cannot divulge confidential information either to attorney or to the legal counsel
subtle challenge to several of the on neutrality and impartiality especially and involves the skill of listening
often position announcements for ombudsman openings as essential for the role
indeed listening is critically important skill for an ombudsman
functioning as designated neutral however requires different approach to listening than is required in many other roles
according to howard gad lin and elizabeth walsh pino help by maintaining their neutrality not by giving and pino
yet facilitative listening also has its challenges
people who initiate request for assistance from an ombudsman often do so because they believe they have been or are about to be treated unfairly
they want the ombudsman to believe that they have legitimate concerns
while the demonstration of empathy often leads those with concerns to feel comfortable with and understood by listener and encourages important disclosure risks exist that the visitor may interpret this deep understanding as agreement that the ombudsman believes she or he has been wronged
an organizational ombudsman conveying agreement disagreement with visitor even unintentionally can easily undermine perceived and actual neutrality
some visitors may in fact be predisposed to believe the ombudsman with and may tell others this after leaving the office regardless of the intentions
it is critically important that the ombudsman educate all visitors about requisite neutrality practiced through avar ia ti on of separating people from the problem
specifically visitors must be helped to understand that strong interest in understanding their problems is not agreement and that the ombudsman is ethically bound to extend equivalent empathy to the others concerned as part of facilitating constructive problem solving
the organizational job is to impartially assist visitors with exploring goals and underlying interests and evaluating range of options
one internally monitored method an ombudsman may use to guide ethical reflective practice while communicating with any visitor is to ask the question would act if the persons with who ma visitor is in conflict were present
he listened to leonard thaddeus recognized that he found story very compelling and he was aware that this could challenge his ability to function with neutrality impartiality as outlined in and
in order to address this concern throughout their conversation he tried his best to listen empathically to feelings while conveying neutrality about the facts
he believed that if the facts were as leonard presented them was inappropriate and she may well have been engaging in bullying
ordinarily he would have also reminded himself that he had only heard and not perceptions about these events
while it was true that he had not heard perceptions as noted above thaddeus had heard of virtually identical complaints from two others who had worked with miriam over number of years
naturally this was impossible to ignore and it presented significant challenge to ability to remain neutral
thaddeus knew that sop required him to the legitimate concerns and interests of all individuals affected by the matter under consideration
despite his empathy for leonard and all he had heard from the two previous employees following sop inspired thaddeus to continue to try to communicate neutrality impartiality as they interacted
as acknowledged by survey respondents organizational neutrals by the very nature of their mandate to multi partiality with long term institutional relationships continually risk being misunderstood and scapegoat ed as betraying personal alliances and unspoken institutional rules eg those in power are protected from each scrutiny scratch
human nature predictably demands loyalty through partiality or sides
and sometimes suspect are those mandated in the for the sake of greater institutional good
as mentioned earlier one survey respondent continually imagines assumptions about the ombudsman role and seeks feedback from all concerned to ensure he is both perceived as neutral and ethically practicing this tricky mandate
skillfully navigating these tough challenges builds reputation for institutional responsiveness
further as is quoted at the beginning of this article and echoed throughout survey response moral and political courage inspire
sop states that the ombudsman should report to the highest possible level within the organization
this reduces the likelihood that an ombudsman will face of interest between her or his supervisory relationships and professional responsibility to sops
as mentioned earlier in cases where pattern of allegations about bullying has emerged following sop an ombudsman may agree or decide to speak with management about
trend or concerns of multiple individuals over to discuss what she or he believes might be potentially serious problem
if an ombudsman can find way to surface ac on cern without revealing the identity of those with whom she or he has communicated she or he could speak with management at her or his own initiative
in fact sop suggests that an ombudsman
exercises sole discretion over whether or how to act regarding an concern trend or concerns of multiple individuals over time
indeed on trends issues policies and practices
outlined by sop falls squarely within scope of responsibilities
however as the above case involving leonard and miriam illustrates simultaneously following these various is sometimes quite challenging
employees who believe they are being bullied usually just want the bullying to stop
many employees fear directly engaging the alleged bully in discussing their concerns and unlike leonard in the case study above do not feel comfortable approaching management themselves
as noted above many employees do not want the ombudsman to talk with the allegedly bullying supervisor either
this scenario may lead an employee to request that an ombudsman speak with someone in management about the matter
while sop suggests an ombudsman is free to do this especially if the complaint represents an apparent trend such decision should be thoroughly considered by both the employee and the ombudsman
possible outcomes advantages and disadvantages of this approach need to be considered
for example alternative outcomes of such conversation are that the manager might listen express concern or dismiss the concern gather additional information do nothing retaliate against the visitors take action to effectively stop the bullying behaviors
as with leonard this conversation can help the visitor assess which members of management are most likely to offer support and effectuate change aswell as evaluate all of their viable options once again as leonard did in analyzing his willingness to act on his own behalf and seek another position
when an ombudsman does speak with management or anyone else about an issue such as alleged bullying while she or he has no sop related obligation the of an alleged bully ethical risks nevertheless exist
the ombudsman may be perceived as aligned against the alleged bullying supervisor and advocating for those who have complained
at the very least approaching management in this situation risks appearing to be in violation of sop an ombudsman not advocate on behalf of any individual in the and sop an ombudsman
has an obligation to consider the legitimate concerns and interests of all individuals affected by the matter under especially if the manager trusts respects and regularly depends on the supervisor in question
given this what can an ombudsman who has never even spoken with an allegedly bullying supervisor do to consider that when she or he goes around her or him and speaks to her or his manager
and how might she or he begin such ac on versation with the alleged supervisor
once again the effectiveness in developing range of possible options to is key
the ombudsman can preface any conversation with manager by reminding her or him that while she or he needs to discuss pattern of concerns that have been brought to her or his attention as an ombudsman she or he is designated neutral
therefore she or he is not an advocate for or against anyone in the organization though raising this kind of concern about alleged behaviors involving single individual may make it look that way
if she or he has not been given permission to speak directly with the supervisor in question this can explained as the manager may wonder why the ombudsman is contacting her or him and not the supervisor
it may also help convey neutrality impartiality to remind the manager that the information is only anecdotal not scientific and in order to be fair to the supervisor it might be beneficial to use degree evaluations andor exit interviews to get fuller and more accurate picture
further the ombudsman can suggest that if the information gathered reveals bullying problems as matter of fairness the manager might want to present the information to the supervisor give her or him an opportunity to respond discuss her or his expectations of appropriate supervisory behavior and if she or he feels it appropriate consider giving the supervisor assistance eg coaching counseling for improving this important area of her or his work performance
while espousing the sops and their basic concepts may be relatively straightforward the case study analysis provided here demonstrates that application is necessarily complex requiring multitasking spiral rather than simple linear reasoning and continuous reflective practice
ombudsmen must know the sops well enough to quickly identify any and all ethical issues present in any given fact set thus identifying all relevant and potentially relevant sops
the ombudsman must at the same time be aware of all mental assumptions and be prepared to consider perspectives of all and accurately identifying this group is yet one more task
reflective practice includes brainstorming available options and evaluating consequence yet again with the sops as criteria
last but not least all skills exercised must be done in line with sops as demonstrated here with neutral listening
while the above description of challenges may seem daunting seasoned organizational ombudsmen report that effective navigation is not only essential but possible and fruitful through continual reliance standards
in one research term reputation for confidentiality compassion helpfulness and with all constituencies builds the credibility and influence needed for effectiveness
it simultaneously protects the ombudsman survey

the purpose of this extended research is to demonstrate the organizational institutional value and impact with focus on responsiveness to most important interests
survey anecdotes like those presented in this article will be used to shape research questions

advanced ethics encompass study of moral reasoning dilemmas between apparently conflicting ethical concepts sincere educated doubt about appropriate and best practice options in ag iv en factual situation reasonable professional difference in applying ethical standards and exploration of human and institutional or blinds pots unconsciousness projection and other distortions that interfere with truth such as groupthink
the latter often stresses the importance of reflective practice which examines perceived incongruence between and talk ways to raise consciousness such as soliciting candid and informed feedback and the skills necessary to effective applied ethics

draft document authored by the ethics and standards committee best practices as up pl eme nt to standards of provides examples with applications of various standards
interestingly although survey respondents linked selection of an office location to within the document this choice is tied directly to confidentiality neutrality impartiality and informality and only indirectly to independence
under the section on confidentiality it says ombudsman office should be situated in an appropriate location to protect the privacy of visitors to the office
the connection to independence is presented more indirectly
sop indicates holds no other position within the organization which might compromise independence
sop states ombudsman is designated independent of ordinary line and staff structures
sop says ombudsman office and the ombudsman are independent from other organizational entities
however the language of the draft recognizes that this is not always possible and advises when it is not ombudsman should provide ombudsman services in location that is different from the location in which the ombudsman in the other role works teaches counsels etc
to clarify the distinctions between roles and to assure confidentiality and off the record informality of the ombudsman communications

micro affirmations micro in eq uit ie sm
in took job at mit working for the then new president and chancellor
was charged among other things with learning how the workplace could improve with respect to people who were underrepresented at examples men and women of color and white women and people with disabilities
as an economist had expected to learn about big issues standing in the way of progress for people
working together with others id id find some
for example we looked at the pension plan plan that paid benefits unequally for men and women with the same record of service
senior officers at mit changed the plan in way that benefited both women and men
helped working group to design serious search recruitment procedures procedures that turned out to help people of course also caucasians
we looked at supports for dependent care that were needed of course illuminated the fact that men also needed support for dependent care
we helped with campus maps and ramps and lifts for those who needed them and learned of course that they helped everyone
learned what everyone equitable work structures usually help everyone
in addition noticed the importance of
little acts of disrespect and failures in performance feedback seemed to corrode some professional relationships like bits of sand and ice
included names mistakenly left off list people who were not introduced at meetings or mistakenly introduced as someone else of the same race
learned of inequitable job assignments failures to provide schedules or food or space that were needed by particular group invitations that were uncomfortable for gays or women or non christians free to bring your will be belly dancer at the join us to
there were ugly cartoons that attacked certain groups and jokes that made fun of different cultures or of disabilities
sometimes would hear ap resumption that someone of certain gender or race or religion could do some task then often led to selective perceptions favoring an already favored group
micro inequities in began writing about
defined them as small events which are often ephemeral and hardtop rove events which are covert often unintentional frequently unrecognized by the perpetrator which occur wherever people are perceived to be
observed what saw as the cumulative corrosive effect of many inequities and concluded that micro inequities have been principal scaffolding for discrimination in the us
micro inequities appeared tobe serious problem since much of this bias is unconscious and even hard to believe when videotaped
found other authors who had looked at micro messages including jean paul sart re with respect to antisemitism and chester pierce md with respect to racism
and found and continue to find huge literature on selective perception ingroups and outgroups pygmalion studies mirror neurons how we communicate emotionally and the will not attempt to summarize here
mainly just pondered from the point of view of apr ac titi oner why if at all would little things make ad if fer en ce
published number of hypotheses as to why micro inequities may be problem
in addition wondered if micro inequities really are problem how did underrepresented and nontraditional people ever succeed
of course the truly important point is that nontraditional people succeed and have succeeded by dint of great talent by strength of character brilliant innovations and very hard work
in addition in the learned something that now is considered commonplace the power of person to person one on one recruitment of mentor ing and of networks to bring minorities and women into traditionally white male organizations and to help them succeed
but wondered how did these practices actually work
observed many hundreds of our top faculty and managers as they recruited effectively and men tored brilliantly and established cohesive and supportive networks with each other and their men tees
and iwa tch ed how some effective supervisors recruited and men tored nontraditional people and lent support to networks of women and people of color
dozen times watched department head get to know networks of people of color and then successfully recruit outstanding men and women who had been thought to exist
once particularly charming handsome and gallant department head happily introduced himself to every woman at as cie nt if ic conference saying that he had been by our ombudsman to get to know all the women
how do effective mentor ing practices work
they seem to me to work by apparently small acts which are often ephemeral and hard to see events that are public and private often unconscious but very effective which occur wherever people wish to help others to succeed
micro affirmations are tiny acts of opening doors to opportunity gestures of inclusion and caring and graceful acts of listening
micro affirmations lie in the practice of generosity in consistently giving credit providing comfort and support when others are in distress when there has been failure at the bench or an idea that did not work out or attack
micro affirmations include the myriad details of fair specific timely consistent and clear feedback that help person build on strength and correct weakness
have come to believe that teaching and training about micro affirmations may help an organization in several different ways the first effect is affirming the work of another person is likely both to help that person do well and to help him or her to enjoy doing well
the second effect is that consistent appropriate affirmation of others can spread from one person raising morale and productivity
it helps everyone men and women people of color and caucasians
it appears to be particularly helpful for department heads and anyone who is senior to another person to affirming behavior
the third effect is subtle and deals with the point that it may be hard for person to himself or herself unconsciously behaving inequitably
may not always be able to behaving in way that do not wish to behave
but if try always to affirm others in an appropriate and consistent way have good chance of blocking behavior of mine that want to prevent
many micro inequities are not affirming others can become conscious as well as unconscious practice that prevents unconscious slights
this effect is the subject of the rest of this essay
implications for action how might all this be useful to all of us and especially to managers
managers can and should pay attention to
the principles of appreciative inquiry are relevant to micro affirmations rather than on strength and success rather than first identifying faults and weakness
small things are especially important with respect to feelings
managers must be impartial about facts but it is often appropriate and helpful to affirm feelings
as it happens it is relatively easy for most people to practice and teach how to affirm feelings
this is important because the of affirmation are not trivial inhuman may follow behavior just as behavior may follow attitudes
whenever question is brought to us about how to change offensive own behavior or that of can teach the principles of changing behavior and explore options about how to do it
people often ask how they can change their own behavior or help someone else to do so
these suggestions are in descending order of probable effectiveness
alas the least effective option at the bottom of the list occurs very commonly in organizations
reinforce and reward good behavior that as it takes place is inconsistent with and blocks the bad behavior that you hope will disappear
it is likely to be important to consider intangible rewards as well as tangible rewards for things right
this is the most effective option
reinforce good behavior commend and reward actions that are helpful commend good performance and the correction of errors
it is likely tobe important to consider intangible rewards as well as tangible rewards for things right
punish bad behavior with appropriate tangible and intangible sanctions
what is good behavior and bad behavior
ignore bad behavior and good behavior
alternately reward and punish could cast it in concrete forever
this is the least effective option
some examples imagine that unit head dr lee asks because he or she is seen to be abrasive and rude
it seems that lee is given to tirades harsh words and cutting criticisms
is reported by certain underrepresented groups to be especially uncomfortable members of those groups simply do not thrive near lee
how did dr lee get this way
it may be that lee has been promoted and given raises because of pushing others fiercely to perform see option six above
has been commended for performance and also scolded for then promoted lee ignores the scolding options even
or many people around lee ignore option five
lee is not likely to change
suppose that dr lee acquires new supervisor or courageous friend who temper in friendly and professional way and suggests to lee that lee might stop the tirades option four
or new supervisor writes disciplinary letter to lee for interpersonal abuse option three
it is possible that lee will notice
now imagine that new supervisors and colleagues and friends commend lee for giving up the tirades option two
it might help even more if lee learns active listening and the habits of supportive feedback option one
suppose that dr lee agrees with you to try an experiment
he or she will attempt not to speak until spoken then will affirm what the other person has said launching into an instruction or request or criticism
lee agrees to practice this behavior whether the topic is mundane or work related
hello it is good morning am happy that it has stopped snowing
continues you help me with this problem dr lee
would be glad to sit down with you about this
and when we finish could we also discuss the next project
bully inga bullying or mobbing as it sometimes known is gaining more attention from researchers and the level of public concern appears to be rising
there are number of issues and questions that come to mind when we consider the problems bullying and mobbing might cause in our work and educational settings
what contributes to or influences the patterns of bullying
what is the impact on students employees and the institution
how is bullying defined and perceived by workers and students
what can be done to control reduce or eliminate the problem
at this time it might be helpful to us in our roles as organizational om buds to review selected recent studies
moa yed farm an dar ais eh nancy shell richard and sam salem
bullying asystematic review of risk factors and outcomes
et ic al issues in er go no mi cs
moa yed et al have attempted to clarify the association between bullying and various workplace conditions and help us understand the outcomes or impact of bullying
they identified studies of workplace bullying cited in eight major data bases and examined seven of the studies published in english in detail
they review major hypotheses and findings for articles published prior to july
additional summaries presented below will provide an update on the more recent research findings
moa yed et al report that among those experiencing bullying psychological health problems were common as was increased absence from the workplace
one study ki vi maki et al indicated that continuous bullying was linked to the early stages of cardiovascular disease among the victims
they also reported that the absence rate for sickness days or more was higher among victims of bullying than for non victims
complaints of dizziness stomach distress and chest pain were reported by and
qui ne suggested that physicians who reported being bullied had lower job satisfaction that th er non bullied colleagues
moa yed et al concluded that bullying has an impact on both organizational and individual levels
the consequences can vary from stress and depression to psychosomatic problems or even cardiovascular diseases
they also determined that variety of workplace factors increase the risk of bullying while interacting with individual factors such as personality and drug or alcohol use
finally they suggested studies need to be carried out to standardize the definition and assessment of workplace bullying so results can be applicable across different cultures and professions
three recent studies that show how bullying is influenced by the complex relationship between the individual and the work environment are summarized below
randle jacqueline steven son keith and ian grayling
randle and her colleagues point out that workplace bullying is growing problem in the national health service that impacts both individuals and the organization
randle et al provide an overview of the problem and suggest individual group and organizational options to help control and minimize the occurrence of bullying
they remind us that bullying problem in the post office and armed forces as well and may be related to the organizational culture
several experts are suggesting move away from an earlier view of bullies as weak with low self esteem
for example lewis offers an alternative view that bullies tend to be highly manipulative socially skilled with the ability to develop social support for their behavior
as we know the greater the social support for behavior even negative behaviors the more resistant the behavior is to modification
randle et al tell us that within the there are organizational triggers for bullying which stress levels inadequate training organizational change and uncertainty pressure from management staff and unrealistic further suggest that it is important to establish an anti bullying culture supported by the highest levels of administration and clearly communicated to all employees
more collaborative work within teams also discourages bullying
according to randle there are some practical steps that will help reduce the amount of workplace bullying disclosure
it is crucial that victims of bullying disclose the problem
through disclosure comes abetter understanding of the circumstances patterns and impact of bullying
supportive colleagues and supervisors are the key to disclosure
employees and management need to be knowledgeable about relevant legislation in the area of workplace harassment and discrimination
victims of bullying should maintain written records of the episodes and circumstances surrounding the events
this will help identify triggers and possibly aid in predicting high risk situations
victims and others should be provided with model and encouraged to standup for their rights
demonstrating how the bullying impacts both individuals and the organization and that the behavior will not be tolerated can be helpful
randle et al bullying is sensitive issue and difficult to address because to be accused of bullying colleague can have devastating consequences
however bullying that goes unchallenged because the working culture tacitly supports it can be even more disastrous for those who are bullied
staff who witness workplace bullying are placed in an unenviable position because they may feel that by intervening they risk becoming the next
managers need to become more proactive in developing effective structures and processes that reduce the incidence of workplace bullying and its effects on staff patients and organ is at ions
si an of workplace bully inga qualitative study of women targets in the public sector
journal of om mun it pp lied
using in depth interviews of women who had been victims of workplace bullying lewis explored how these women struggled to identify and cope with the behavior
difficulty in appropriately identifying behavior as bullying impedes both the coping responses and the response to the bullying
victims of bullying and their supervisors often have different interpretations of what is occurring
it is not uncommon for supervisors to place responsibility for bullying on the personal traits and behaviors
all ten of the interviewed women were professionals in the public sector and had been victims of workplace bullying over period of several months
interviews were conducted by female researchers either in the homes or in private office in the workplace
interviews were semi structured allowing for variability as the discussion progressed and lasted between and hours
it was common for targets initially to trivialize or minimize the behaviors directed against them even though these actions impacted performance
reports included patterns of questioning qualifications in public interrupting and ignoring at meetings removing comfortable office chairs and replacing with old furniture deliberately removing data and information essential for the job and denying the right to express an opinion
participants indicated that it was difficult to acknowledge interpersonal problems at work that doing so threatened their own and of competence
an inability to cope was seen as threat to their status as professional women
thus they tried to cope with the problems on their own rather than seek assistance
maintaining commitment to professional and organizational values
several women expressed that the behavior directed against them directly conflicted with their views of how professionals were expected to behave
one stated very disappointing when it comes from people in similar professions with qualifications to suggest that they have compassion
recognizing and identifying the behavior as bullying also challenged perceptions of the organization
nine of the ten bullies were managers which meant that coming to the realization that the offensive behavior was indeed bullying meant that there were problems in the power structure of the organization and perhaps the organization itself
never have believed that management would aid and abet bully and
it would have been much better if blindfolded me and shot me they took away everything that ever morally believed in
each of the ten participants experienced health related symptoms which were validated by their health professionals
typically the symptoms were not linked to the bullying until late in the process
was an available powerful and accessible explanation for difficulties
participants were seen by others and themselves as failing to function as individuals rather than identifying difficulties within the wider context of the workplace
lewis these explanations minimized the role of managers and the organization
it was clear that most participants did not identify the behavior as bullying early in the process
some only came to that realization by chance when reading about bullying or hearing accounts from others
it also became evident that identifying or naming the behaviors as bullying was the start of the recovery process and impacted upon perceptions of self and self esteem
lewis concluded that bullying progressed and as participants gained information about workplace bullying they were more likely to recognize and name their experiences and shift from self blame to locating difficulties in others and within their organizations
lewis while there was no reference to om buds within these specific org ai ni zati ons it is not unreasonable to suggest that working with these victims of bullying would be appropriate for organizational om buds
increasing awareness understanding and proper identification of troubling behaviors may facilitate earlier intervention and maintain the self image and perceptions of both their personal value and the integrity of the organization
prey turns predatory workplace bullying as predictor of counter aggression bullying coping and wellbeing
european journal of work rg ani za ti on al
are workers who are bullied more or less likely to bully others
lee and brothe ridge bullied by others leads to counter aggressive bullying behaviours on the part of behaviours towards others may lead to being bullied by others
and coping responses are positively associated with forms of bullying
that is the coping response chosen mirrors the pattern of bullying yelling leads to yelling and isolation leads to isolation
sample of canadian workers completed an anonymous survey on work experiences which included measures of bullying
the sample included managers professionals and clerical workers
three types of bullying were identified verbal abuse undermining work and belittlement
nearly half of the respondents reported being the target of at least one act of bullying weekly during the prior months and noted that bullying occurred at least times per week
analyses showed that bullied by others was not directly linked to burnout or ill health in targets but appeared to operate through their sense of self doubt which in turn affected level of wellbeing
further aggressive responses were common reactions to being targeted particularly following verbal abuse that was often met with reciprocal verbal abuse
revenge and retaliation were often cited as the motivation for continuing the bullying
bullying in the form of belittlement was more likely to increase self doubt resulting in effects on health and wellbeing

this article summarizes significant legislation and case law relating to organizational om buds between january and january
during this period the field saw favorable developments on the legislative side at both the federal and state level
the united states congress amended its charter of the american red cross to require the creation of an om buds program
the texas state legislature favorably considered but was unable to pass bill that would have created first of its kind shield law for om buds
in addition although there were no published decisions from state or federal courts the securities and exchange commission created important precedent in an administrative matter
in february us senator chuck grass ley introduced the national red cross governance modernization act of to amend the congressional charter of the american national red cross among other things senate bill proposed creation of an organizational om buds who would report to congress on trends and systemic matters confronting the red cross
the bill was quickly reconciled with house bill sponsored by representative tom lant os
loc go vc gib inbd query the legislation passed with broad and bipartisan support in the house and senate and was signed into law by president bush on may in endorsing the creation of an om buds for preeminent nonprofit congress reiterated the fundamental ethical tenets of the international ombudsman association
in its findings congress stated in relevant part given the role of the american national red cross in carrying out its services programs and activities and meeting its various obligations the effectiveness of the american national red cross will be promoted by the creation of an organizational ombudsman will be neutral or impartial dispute resolution practitioner whose major function will be to provide confidential and informal assistance to the many internal and external stake holders of the american national red cr os sb will report to the chief executive officer and the audit committee of the board of governors an dc will have access to anyone and any documents in the american national red cross
in march texas state representative patrick rose introduced legislation house bill which would have created state privilege for private and public sector organizational om buds
endorsed and supported the bill through the legislative process
the texas house of representatives approved by vote of to and sent the bill to the senate jurisprudence committee for consideration on the final day of committee hearings
several texas om buds provided testimony before the committee
although favorably received by the senate jurisprudence committee the bill was left pending when the texas legislature adjourned its biennial session on may there is no indication of whether or not texas lawmakers intend to revisit the issue when the state legislature convenes its next biennial session in fall
in the administrative case of in the matter of sky capital the sec reviewed decision by the national association of securities and exchange dealers
as the primary regulator of industry na sd licenses individuals and admits firms to the industry writes rules to govern their behavior examines them for regulatory compliance and disciplines those who fail to comply
in this matter broker dealer sky capital alleged that it had been harassed by the na sd and denied access internal complaint process
among other things the firm said that its complaints to the na sd om buds had on deaf ears
dismissing the case the sec that said the alleged failure by the om buds did not trigger sec jurisdiction because the om buds did not deny sky capital access to the formal membership functions
the sec also noted that under the ombudsman association standards of practice which were available to sky capital through the na sd web site the na sd om buds had discretion in determining whether to act on concern brought to its attention
the sec thus acknowledged the relevance of the standards of practice and affirmed the om buds role as neutral and independent
as published decision this administrative matter may serve as precedent for future securities cases by clarifying the role of an organizational om buds and thus is positive for the field and especially the na sd om buds program

foundations and skills for constructive conflict ra ns formation mennonite conciliation service fourth edition
there is bengali saying mit am ca sar am ca va co hi vag mi ta truth spoken concisely is true eloquence
an om buds friend told me recently that she doubted if many of us find the time to regularly read up on subjects pertaining to our profession
she indicated that were the way to go
think it proves grasp of his or her subject if he or she can convey the key points in the shortest possible space
the mennonite conciliation mediation and facilitation training manual is series of over one or two page summaries covering spectrum of topics related to the broad field of conflict resolution
the manual was originally series of papers stapled together and used for training
over the years it grew to be what it is today page collection in its fourth edition
it contains sections on personal relational structural and cultural dimensions of it with five to ten mini essays on each dimension and on communications skills group facilitation creating systemic change and ethics
there is also lengthy section on mediation and section on pedagogy that describes how to train others in conflict resolution
there are number of essays by wellknown mennonite peace builders such as john paul lede rach howard and david who spoke at conference in
the mediation section covers all the steps in the mediation process used by practitioners
it also covers specific topics of interest for mediators
the pages on working with power imbalances handling difficult situations and intercultural mediations may prove especially helpful for om buds
the section on group facilitation provides practical suggestions that found missing in books exclusively dedicated to the subject
the writings of others on restorative justice offer lucid introduction to subject believe is important for om buds tobe familiar with
the section on conflict analysis in particular stands out
discussions with om buds lead me to believe that our cases are getting more complicated with multi cohorts multicultural influences multi contexts and so on
the manual offers number of tools to visually map such situations
found it helpful to sit together with visitor and use these analysis tools to help the visitor better understand situation they are trying to deal with
the manual hide its mennonite roots
the first section is titled transformation and and offers sixteen faith based discussions on peace building providing biblical basis for the practice of peace building
mennonites are known for their principles and practices have had lasting impact on the community
the new ombudsman will find much here in the form of ideas and skills that can help improve our ability to aid visitors
readers inevitably will come across pages where they say to themselves me try that out
the seasoned ombudsman the manual serves as refresher
book to take down from the shelf at any time and instantly connect with theory or practical tips
other books certainly offer more in depth information on the various subjects covered in this manual
yet to find book however that covers such variety of subjects with truly substantial information

conflict management systems oversight of management systems corporate governance best practice
introduction part basic principles and account abilities basic principles for oversight table basic questions for oversight to whom is the system accountable
during the number of major american companies implemented comprehensive conflict management systems
in those cases in which was involved decisions about whether or not such as ys tem was necessary as well as host of other issues related to the design of the system were often the subject of significant debate or disagreement what roles or options should be included in the system
what kinds of problems or conflicts could be raised through the system
how much confidentiality should the organization allow to those coming forward
these and other questions sometimes led to impasse stalemate or inertia within management because of conflicting views or interests
wrapped up in such discussions quite often were conversations about supervision reporting relationships and funding and those discussions could be equally intense
in some cases decisions about that second set of reporting critical to resolving the logjam
those conversations however were more about the underlying decision about whether or not to proceed and about meeting the needs of the various parties and the organization
they were less about how and why to provide effective oversight or how oversight of such systems was related to management or governance principles and practices outside of the area of conflict management
in after my involvement with such projects had ended and after had chance to reflect on things ib ec ame very interested in piece that had begun to feel was missing developing comprehensive framework for oversight of conflict management systems
one source of my interest was certainly reflection on the projects been involved with aswell as the related writing had the privilege of doing with karl sla ik eu
there was second source of my interest in this independent interest and increasing involvement in the world of corporate governance
as learned more about the roles of the director and the board and about what principles and best practices in corporate governance and management had to say about how to provide oversight to an organization became even more convinced that those same principles and best practices had lot to say about how to provide oversight to conflict management system
this article is about how to provide oversight to ac om prehensive conflict management system including the system as whole the options within the system and those who staff the system or who have responsibilities in relation to the system
this article is not about what system is or how it has been covered extensively in the literature
nor is this article about what constitutes effectiveness in conflict management system
much has been said about that topic and much more probably will be written about it elsewhere
will discuss set of principles and framework for the oversight of comprehensive conflict management systems
first will suggest that set of principles and account abilities growing from overlapping sets of principles and best practices in corporate governance management conflict management and organizational theory can provide basis for developing or evaluating oversight procedures
will then review ase ries of processes and mechanisms that in combination offer flexible framework for oversight
will suggest important considerations for some of the individual oversight mechanisms described and identify key problems related to others
the question of how to provide effective oversight to comprehensive systems deserves discussion and research and hope much more experimentation
hope this article will encourage all three of those activities within and among several groups
one group is composed of those working within the fields of corporate governance management and dispute resolution
the second group is composed of those who staff or manage comprehensive conflict management systems within organizations
the third group is made up of the management and boards of organizations thinking about how to provide effective oversight to such system or to conflict management options and programs currently in place including programs for ethics oversight
intend the phrase comprehensive conflict management system to be interchangeable with aphra se used widely in the field today integrated conflict management system
to offer very sum mary definition only the term comprehensive conflict management systems refers to systems involving variety of options including collaborative options for resolving conflicts by mutual agreement of the parties higher authority options for resolving conflicts via investigation or decision by person or persons authorized to decide and specialized options for responding to unusual or difficult problems or problems involving specific characteristics or danger with collaborative and higher authority options available internally and externally
it includes independent and neutral third party options that allow parties to seek informal assistance anonymously or confidentially with far less risk of triggering retaliation
by the term option mean process or function for uncovering andor addressing problems conflicts or disputes
well designed comprehensive system invites parties to come forward with problems of any kind
it encourages collaborative approaches while providing fair higher authority options and specialized options for use as needed and allows choice from the available options for all parties to the conflict
it prohibits retaliation for use of the system and punishes retaliation when it can be established and exposed
this approach is established as policy and is linked to organizational values and goals
the policy procedures standards and requirements that form the foundation of the system are integrated into relevant documents and resource materials printed and electronic as necessary to trigger or support use of the system
the conflict management responsibilities associated with each role in the organization are integrated into job descriptions and performance assessment criteria and instruments
in comp re hen system every employee receives training to understand what the system is and how it works aswell as the privileges and responsibilities in relation to the system
each employee also receives skills training geared to job function and level of responsibility to equip that employee to fulfill his or her responsibilities in relation to the system
it includes comprehensive program for collecting and reporting data as tool for informing oversight and ensuring accountability
this discussion focuses on comprehensive systems for managing conflict in the workplace and the example si have had in mind involve primarily non unionized settings
the same principles and approaches can be applied in unionized settings
they can be applied as well to comprehensive systems for managing external conflicts with customers partners and vendors for example and to comprehensive systems designed to manage internal and external conflicts
in the context of this article the term oversight refer to procedures processes and mechanisms used to establish that the conflict management system as aw hole the options within the system and those who staff the system or who have responsibilities in relation to it are operating as intended and fulfilling their respective functions roles responsibilities achieving established goals and objectives related to the system and helping the organization as whole to honor its mission and values and achieve its key business objectives
the purposes of oversight derive directly from the definitions in the preceding paragraphs to the system functions as intended and that it achieves its goals and to allow for continuing improvement with respect to both the functioning or operations of the system and its success in achieving its goals as defined by the organization
how can an organization establish foundation for developing or evaluating oversight that provides solid starting flexibility from organization to organization
the first section of part describes basic principles for oversight
as with the framework presented in part ii the principles in chapter grow from overlapping sets of principles and best practices in corporate governance management conflict management and organizational theory by starting with set of principles based on overlapping standards from several fields organizations can begin with common reference foundation
by focusing on balancing principles rather than adopting specific model for oversight organizations can maintain flexibility
the second section of part describes the account abilities of the conflict management system and how those account abilities might be addressed via oversight
part ii will use the basic principles and account abilities described in chapters and as abas is for evaluating alternative arrangements for oversight
by starting with set of principles for oversight based on overlapping standards from several fields organizations can begin with common reference point
the principles below grow from principles and best practice standards in corporate governance management conflict management and organizational theory
the common reference point embodied in these principles provides foundation for evaluating oversight procedures
by focusing on balancing principles rather than adopting specific model for oversight organizations can maintain flexibility
there may be tension if not an outright conflict between any two or more of the following principles and any given oversight mechanism or process
for that reason achieving balance rather than harmony among the principles seems like more realistic goal
oversight and management procedures should be designed encourage use of the conflict management support operational ensure reflect the characteristics of the organization honor the purposes and features of individual options and roles within the provide feedback as basis for improvement demonstrate consistency with principles of corporate governance and best practices in dispute resolution foster compliance with ethical standards regulations and laws
encourage use of the conflict management system
one of the basic purposes behind implementing ac om prehensive conflict management system is to encourage anyone with conflict of any kind to use the system
unless the system invites problems of every type and size those problems cannot be uncovered and addressed
oversight pro ce dures should not unduly complicate the work of those engaged in conducting the primary business of the organization or of those who staff the conflict management system
in other words oversight procedures should not decrease the ability of management to achieve the primary mission of the organization or interfere with management systems that support those efforts
oversight procedures should help the organization to ensure the accountability of the system as whole as well as the accountability of each option within the system and those who staff the system or who have responsibilities in relation toit
oversight procedures must enable the company to assess the success of the system in achieving the goals set for it by the organization
the organization must also be able to determine if the system supports it in achieving its primary business mission and business objectives
finally oversight procedures must enable the company to assess whether or not the system operating as or not it the system is working in terms of process
reflect the characteristics of the organization in question
as with the underlying system oversight procedures must be consistent with the mission values and business objectives of the individual organization
they should be tailored to fit its culture and organizational structure the nature of its operations and its management procedures and systems
oversight procedures that serve one organization well may not work in another
honor the purposes and features of individual options and roles within the system
oversight procedures must also take into account the differing characteristics and purposes of individual options and roles within the system
human resources hr functions are designed to provide among other services formal mechanism for raising concerns with respect to official company policy or the requirements imposed by law or regulation
the role of the hr function in conflict management system is very different indeed from that of an organizational ombudsman function designed to provide neutral independent confidential and informal assistance to any member of the organization
oversight procedures must allow for the differences in how such options operate in order for each to serve its purpose in the system
provide feedback as basis for improvement or change
comprehensive conflict management system can be powerful tool for improving overall operations as well as success in achieving its only if information is shared
one key principle therefore is to structure oversight procedures to provide information to managers and functions throughout the organization as basis for improving the performance and operations of the system and the organization
demonstrate consistency with principles of corporate governance and best practices in dispute resolution
principles of corporate governance set out the respective responsibilities of senior management and the board of directors for managing and providing oversight to the company
in doing so they provide guidance for oversight of the conflict management system since oversight for any management system or subsystem should be consistent with the principles guiding oversight of the organization as aw hole
in like fashion professional standards of practice guide practitioners such as ombudsmen mediators and arbitrators
best practice standards for the design and implementation of conflict management systems also exist and are continuing to evolve
such standards are the product of considerable experience and research as well as discussion and debate within the field of dispute resolution
the conflict management system and those who staff it will operate more effectively if oversight procedures reflect careful attention to best practice standards for systems and practitioners
it is important to note that the various sets of standards referred to in this paragraph are not themselves totally consistent with one the suggestion in this paragraph that oversight procedures reflect careful attention rather than strict compliance with best practice standards in dispute resolution
foster compliance with ethical standards regulations and laws
every organization is or should be subject to one or more sets of ethical standards or codes of conduct
indeed one of the most pronounced trends in corporate governance is the responsibility of oversight systems to ensure ethical operations
comprehensive conflict management systems as defined in the introduction should enhance the ability of the organization to surface misconduct or the violation of ethical standards
oversight procedures should support the system in achieving this goal and in determining if the system is fulfilling its responsibility to do so
similarly oversight mechanisms should support the conflict management system in ensuring compliance with local state and federal regulatory and standards imposed by society at large
this requires carefully designed procedures and clearly established supervisory and oversight responsibilities for senior management and the board
to offer one specific example an ombudsman operating consistently with best practice standards and reporting directly to the with access to the board can help an organization comply with federal sentencing guidelines
part ii presents framework based on my belief that ensuring effective oversight of conflict management systems requires series of interrelated mechanisms processes and responsibilities
this approach draws on principles and best practices from corporate governance management organizational theory and conflict management
believe the overlap among these sets of standards and practices offers common reference point and provides foundation for the framework
basing the framework on several overlapping sets of principles and standards also establishes consistency between oversight of conflict management system oversight in areas outside of the conflict management system and oversight of some individual conflict management processes and roles
part ii will address the set of mechanisms and processes for oversight that taken together make up the framework
the discussion of principles and account abilities in part will provide reference points for evaluating alternative arrangements
part ii covers the various components of oversight in ase ries of sections
the third section of this article deals with oversight of the system as whole
it suggests that direct management responsibility for the conflict management system as whole should lie with the senior management of the company and that the board of directors is responsible for providing oversight
it further suggests that senior leadership can strengthen oversight through number of supporting mechanisms
the fourth section describes supervision and oversight for individual options in the system
by options mean mechanisms or processes for resolving conflicts offered through established programs or offices
the fifth section describes the role of data collection and reporting program in informing oversight and ensuring accountability
it also describes an overall approach for developing such programs
the sixth section addresses supervision and oversight of individual employees with respect to their responsibilities in relation to the conflict management system
the seventh and final section addresses special considerations that apply in providing direct supervision and oversight to individual key professionals who staff the system
sections and will suggest that reporting relationships provide the foundation for oversight of the individual options as well as for oversight of individual employees including key staff professionals
developing af lex ib le framework in starting with principles as foundation one of my goals is to suggest flexible framework for oversight
believe few key concepts can help in maintaining flexibility comprehensive approach as management system the first challenge is promoting framework for oversight lies in encouraging the organization to think of conflict management systemically
can the organization see its existing roles processes and programs for managing conflict as being or capable of being an effective management system
my experience has been that many do not
rather many if not most organizations tend to think of resolving individual disputes on case by case basis
they tend to think in terms of the particular programs or roles currently in place or the services they can acquire for resolving the individual matter in question
and they tend to think of using existing programs or roles to resolve full blown disputes rather than comprehensive approaches to uncover conflicts early and prevent them from escalating
if the organization has all of the elements of comprehensive conflict management system in place and if it can picture that system as one more company wide management system like its budgeting system or its goal setting process or its incentive system it can and should structure oversight just as it would for any other management system
the framework described in part ii should fit with how an organization might provide oversight to any such system
the conflict management system as an internal control process one particularly useful and practical way to encourage this kind of systemic thinking is to invite the organization to see comprehensive conflict management as an internal control process
this comparison is quite powerful because private sector nonprofit and governmental entities alike are familiar with internal control processes via best practices incorporate governance management and accounting
it is particularly powerful believe because it is accurate one can fairly describe conflict management system as an integrated system designed among other purposes to support the organization in achieving such objectives as complying with laws and regulations and operating effectively and efficiently in achieving the organizational mission
this description fits well with the standard definitions for an internal control process
since any company wide management system is part of the internal control system it also builds on the preceding comprehensive conflict management should be treated as any other company wide system
once the organization sees its conflict management system as an internal control process or as akin to one the model for providing oversight and the appropriate roles of management and the board become clearer still
to illustrate how this characterization supports the approach described in this article have referred to internal control processes at several key points
the conflict management system as key component of risk management an even more recent trend provides further support for the approach described here over the past several years organizations having become increasingly interested in moving beyond strengthening internal control systems to developing organization wide approaches to risk management referred to as enterprise risk management
internal control processes or internal control systems as described immediately above and defined in are key components of an enterprise risk management process
as also noted above ib eli eve comprehensive conflict management system fits squarely with the definition of an internal control process
beyond this specific and direct connection comprehensive conflict management system also dovetails closely with the definition fundamental concepts and objectives of the broader enterprise risk management framework itself
again once the organization sees its conflict management system as key component within comprehensive risk management program the framework for oversight and the appropriate roles of management and the board become clear and consistent with oversight of other management systems
to illustrate the importance of the connection between comprehensive conflict management and comprehensive risk management have noted the link between oversight responsibilities and risk management at relevant points
the dynamic nature of oversight am not suggesting static model for but
well managed organizations routinely modify or alter oversight procedures in response to changing conditions
this certainly includes oversight procedures for conflict management systems
maintaining effective oversight requires an ongoing consideration of existing procedures in light of changes in the conflict management system or in the organization its operations or its operating environment
the design process as collaborative in controlling the costs of conflict we suggested that success in designing implementing and evaluating conflict management system requires input from those who must authorize the system those who might use it and those who will staff its operations
the same recommendation applies to oversight procedures
the mechanisms described in the remainder of this article can be sources of great conflict because of the varying interests of the parties to the system
involving all parties in the design process can have lot to do with whether or not the system comes into being in the first place whether or not employees and managers accept it and how well it functions
adopting this approach with respect to oversight also has lot to do with the adequacy quality and value of the oversight provided
it has lot to do with whether or not oversight ensures accountability
the tension between professional expectations and the needs of the organization my experience has been that organizations will listen carefully to advice from conflict management experts and practitioners in developing oversight procedures
the individual organization however may modify recommended approaches to meet its needs interests operating structure and culture
the result can be oversight arrangements that diverge from professional standards and tension between the views of dispute resolution professionals and those responsible for managing the organization
management must run the organization for the benefit of shareholders and ensure accountability in keeping with principles of corporate governance and best practices in management
the various sets of standards and codes developed within the field of conflict management on the other hand are the product of much experience research and debate
each group is likely to use its own standards and expectations as starting point
the value of good faith experimentation evolution and experimentation with respect to conflict management systems and roles has been quite common
oversight procedures will change along with the underlying system
they may change for many other reasons as accommodate the or changes in its structure or in the operating environment for example
well managed org ani za ti ons with comprehensive conflict management systems have experimented with alternative arrangements for virtually every mechanism process or element of oversight described in part ii
they will continue to do so and believe such experimentation is essential to innovation and progress
balancing the principles described in part can provide starting point for good faith experimentation or lead to new ideas when proposed arrangements vary from professional standards or expectations
by approaching the topic as it would with any other management system the organization can develop practical framework for oversight
taking this approach suggests that responsibility for the conflict management system as whole should lie with the senior management of the company with the board of directors providing oversight to senior management
senior leadership can further strengthen oversight through number of supporting mechanisms
direct management by the under prin of corporate governance the and the senior management team under the direction are responsible for operating and managing the company
they must conduct the business of the corporation effectively and ethically
this includes achieving the primary business objectives of the organization implementing effective internal control systems and compliance and risk management programs establishing culture standards and processes that promote ethical behavior and providing for the fair treatment of employees
principles of corporate governance also call for companies to establish mechanisms through which any employee can raise concerns regarding misconduct with senior management or the board
taken together these obligations suggest that responsibility for oversight of the conflict management system as whole rests with the
if the conflict management system is an integrated company wide system as defined in the introduction this approach makes the preceding section on developing flexible framework and
recognizing the conflict management system as an internal control process or as comparable to one provides additional support for the preceding discussion in the introduction to part ii
the can delegate her responsibility to one or more members of her management team as she might with any other management system or key program and those senior managers may in turn assign responsibilities to others
the or the designated manager would be responsible for evaluating on behalf of the organization the success of the program in achieving its goals and whether the program was operating as intended
the ce ode sign ated manager also would be responsible for recommending any changes or adjustments in program policy operations or funding in consultation with senior management and those supervising individual options in the system
management of the conflict management system should be included in evaluating the performance of the responsible manager or managers
in comprehensive system some of the individual options are designed to operate independently of the normal chain of command
such options play key role in supporting oversight of the system as of the purposes of such arrangements is to ensure information from any employee or any level in the organization can be brought the attention of the most senior leadership in the organization
hence the or specifically designated senior line officer should also have direct supervisory responsibility for those individual options designed to operate independently of the normal chain of command
the ombudsman and the newly emerging chief ethics and compliance officer ce co role are two primary examples of such positions
oversight by the board of directors the board of directors is responsible for oversight of the management of the affairs primarily through its oversight of the and her senior management team
the board is also responsible for compliance with ethical and legal standards and for overseeing the risk management process and the management of internal control processes
the company is charged with establishing mechanisms through which allegations of misconduct can be raised with senior management or the board
based on these standards oversight responsibilities should include oversight of the performance in managing the conflict management system
given the responsibilities and its responsibility to oversee compliance with legal and ethical standards in particular the ombudsman and any other key specialists designed to operate independently of the chain of command such as chief ethics compliance officer should have access to the board on anas needed basis
conversely the board should have access to such key specialists as necessary to fulfill its oversight responsibilities
also believe boards ought to consider some process or mechanism for receiving regular report from roles such as the ombudsman andor the chief ethics compliance officer for the reasons described in the preceding paragraphs
given current trends in corporate governance and the continuing evolution of the role in ethics oversight such practices may receive increasing consideration
elsewhere have also suggested the idea of brand new role to support the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities the board ombudsman
this role would particularly helpful to the board with respect to problems involving the board or some of its members as parties as well as with respect to ethics oversight and with the to make sure channels are in place through which allegations of misconduct can be brought to the board
the organization can enhance oversight by strengthening communication coordination and information sharing with the system
one way to achieve this goal is by assigning to one or more key specialists number of specific responsibilities designed to establish central support for the entire system
such responsibilities might include serving as liaison among the options representing the program publicly managing or providing conflict management skills training for employees managing the evaluation program for the system as whole developing communication materials and programs and coordinating common activities
the roles best suited to such responsibilities are those that require the broadest range of conflict management skills abilities and knowledge operate independently of the normal chain of command with access to the most senior leadership of the organization involve the broadest set of working relationships throughout the company lead to the most extensive knowledge of the problems patterns and trends occurring in the organization and include the responsibility to identify and raise systemic issues
while the ombudsman seems extremely well qualified to serve as central supporting resource assuming such responsibilities may be inconsistent with professional standards
those standards call for the ombudsman to avoid responsibilities that might conflict with the independence or neutrality of the role
in addition the time for additional responsibilities such as these may be quite limited given the day today demands of the role
assisting with such responsibilities indirectly as am ember of systems support something the ombudsman could probably square with best practice standards though it might be best if he or she participated on an ex officio or periodic basis
the chief ethics compliance officer role ce co also embodies many of the characteristics desirable in central supporting resource
some of the responsibilities of the role such as training and ethics program evaluation complement the proposed duties of central reporting resource
in addition under proposed best practice standards for the role the ce co is also likely to have the funding and staffing to support such responsibilities
other responsibilities of the ce co such as investigating misconduct and auditing and monitoring ethics and compliance programs may make the role less suitable for other central supporting resource responsibilities
as with the ombudsman however the duties of the job may not leave the ce co with the time to serve as sole central supporting resource
if the organization has program manager for the conflict management system that role should almost by definition serve as the central supporting resource
the key focus of such role is on the very responsibilities described above
few organizations however have created this role
organizations debating how to create central supporting resources without adding new positions might consider establishing the program manager role informally by assigning the responsibilities of program manager to an existing role
creating this position informally could also off era very practical useful solution for providing oversight to several individual options that do not fit neatly under any office or role
see figure and the discussion in the next section regarding oversight of individual options
in the absence of program manager two or more roles could split or share central support responsibilities as appropriate
the best possible check on the system as aw hole is to make sure that the data collected and reported in the individual options are shared throughout the organization and used to improve the performance of the system and of the individual components or functions within it
one approach used by some organizations is to provide such oversight through systems support committee
the committee should be composed of senior line and staff functions including compliance functions and the ombudsman
see the discussion above an dn
ombudsman should participate way that will not create the impression that he or she is performing management role
the senior officer responsible for oversight of the system as aw hole should certainly be member of the committee
such committees might meet regularly to review reports generated through the data collection and reporting program as described later in this article aswell as any ad hoc or special reports and to exchange information among committee members for the purpose of identifying trends warning signs and useful lessons for the entire organization
while such committee typically serves in an advisory rather than decision making capacity its review of available data can lead to organizational changes in two key ways
first the committee can offer advisory recommendations to organizational leadership
suppose for example the committee identifies ac om pa ny wide confusion regarding benefits
the committee could recommend that the develop new communication plan to resolve the confusion
second any individual committee member could take direct action with respect to apr obl em or concern related directly to his or her primary responsibilities
for example based on the data reported the senior vice president for human resources could conclude that the existing diversity training program needs to be increased in intensity and scope
he could act on that conclusion in his individual capacity as the senior vice president for human resources
finally the sharing of information among committee members and in turn with the organization as whole is an incredibly powerful check on the operations of each option within the system
support via independent evaluation an organization can also support its system by making appropriate use of independent evaluators
by independent evaluators mean independent professionals with expertise and experience to assist the organization in evaluating the performance andor the operations of the system
the organization might ask an independent evaluator to assess single particular question or to conduct an independent review of the entire program
an independent evaluator can assist the organization in assessing whether its goals for the system are being met and can be especially helpful in establishing the credibility of new program addressing especially sensitive issues or issues which are the subject of disagreement within the organization providing expertise with respect to particular roles or functions within the system or with respect to the design implementation or evaluation of the system or in offering new or different perspectives to supplement the views of those normally responsible for reviewing the performance of the system
some companies we worked with in the began with questions such as these some sought an independent evaluation once the comprehensive system was in place
the organization can also benefit from using external resources to identify problems and trends that might affect its system
for example through meetings with regulatory agencies the organization can gather information about problems trends or emerging concerns that might affect the operations of its entire system
an organization can reap similar benefits by participating in professional associations and conferences related to corporate governance management and conflict management
by building external relationships and using those relationships to identify information of value or concern to the system the organization establishes another check against the operations of its system
to develop external relationships as source of information for oversight the organization must assign responsibility for developing those relationships to specific roles
figure depicts how reporting relationships and key oversight responsibilities might look in comprehensive system based on the approach described in this chapter
the system shown in figure includes ap rog ram manager role which might not exist in many organizations or which might only the discussion in this section and in the next section on oversight for individual options
since figure presents hypothetical comprehensive system the chart also includes an ombudsman and ac hi ef ethics and compliance officer ce co

some of the options included in the hypothetical system are listed under more than one role in figure to illustrate alternatives for supervision one might see from organization to organization

code of conduct code of ethics oversee or support options in the system for official review appeal investigation
serve as liaison to relevant professional associations regulatory and legislative manage evaluation program
reporting relationships provide the foundation for oversight of the individual options in the conflict management system
they do so by ensuring the accountability of each option in the system and of those who staff each option to specifically designated supervising function or role
key features characteristics traditional options are designed to allow those closest to the problem to resolve it among themselves with support from the line of authority
such support is often provided through series of hierarchical steps beginning within the office department or business unit in question
compliance options are designed to allow parties to seek assistance regarding the interpretation or application of official company policy or compliance with legal obligations or ethical standards through authorized organizational channels such human resources department an equal employment opportunity office or corporate security office
well designed traditional and compliance options encourage efforts to resolve problems through collaborative means such as direct talk and informal mediation whenever possible and appropriate but also allow for resolving problems through decisions via the line of supervision or through investigation and decision
traditional and compliance options are not designed to offer high levels of confidentiality to the parties
while those involved in solving the problem may attempt to hold the matter in confidence information will be sought and shared as needed to resolve the problem
it is also quite likely that the person whose assistance is requested will have some stake in or her assistance will not be neutral
one example of traditional option as defined here would be an open door policy
as have seen organizations use the term an open door policy encourages an employee to raise or address any workplace concern or complaint with the parties most directly involved in the problem with assistance available through the line of supervision or from the human resources department hr
the employee may skip levels in the line of supervision to seek assistance and may proceed to the most senior levels if necessary
examples of compliance options might include appealing disciplinary decision or requesting af or mal investigation of perceived misconduct through hr or seeking assistance from an equal employment opportunity office regarding complaint of discrimination or from the security staff regarding specific kinds of employee misconduct
reporting arrangements for traditional and comp li an ce options supervision and oversight occurs through the line of supervision
each level of management provides direction and supervision to those within its designated span of control
broader oversight and appeal occurs through successively higher levels of management as specified by the organization
review or appeal may also occur through other options in the system
comments the very definitions of such options specify that oversight will occur through the line of supervision perhaps with support from staff functions
options such as these can encourage direct talk and resolution among those closest to the problem particularly if all of the other elements of comprehensive system as described in the introduction are present
the opportunity to seek review or appeal through other options in the system can not only broaden oversight but also increase accountability
the ombudsman key features characteristics for an org ani za ti on al ombudsman operating under the code of ethics and standards of practice of the international ombudsman association four neutrality independence and central to the role
the ombudsman offers an exceptionally high level of confidentiality to all parties protecting the confidentiality of communications with the office and resisting requests or formal demands for testimony or information in any formal proceeding internal or external
an organizational ombudsman operates independently from the normal chain of command
independence helps the ombudsman to resist pressure
it also helps the ombudsman to preserve confidences to raise even the most difficult of issues with any person in the organization and to act as an advocate for systemic change
the ombudsman also operates as designated or she does not represent the organization or any individual employee
systems support committee informs oversight re office of the ombudsman via advisory oversight of system as ombudsman access to board on an fits key characteristics of role
requires serious commitment from senior leadership
best structural approach to protect key characteristics of the role
accepted as best practice by excellent approach for meeting corporate governance channel through which any employee can raise allegations with senior management or the board anonymously or in ombudsman board communication should be two way does the board have access to the ombudsman on anas needed basis
consider process for regular reports to the board
or not to create the role can be source of great controversy and conflict
if the role is created conversations about how to provide supervision and oversight may also prove quite contentious
organizations worry about how to ensure section on special considerations for key staff professionals
line or staff officers may be concerned about creating what they see as another level of bureaucracy
the mere discussion of the role can launch turf wars when one or more offices see the ombudsman as duplicating services already provided or when one office sees the role as plus while another does not
the nature of the role runs so contrary to the training and experience of many human resources and employee relations professionals that the reporting relationship recommended under professional standards may be difficult to accept
as result organizations may encounter fierce internal debates or pressure from some quarter regarding the form and nature of oversight for the ombudsman
alternatively they may find themselves engaging in such debate later after the office is in place
in my experience it is not at all uncommon for organizations to consider andor implement reporting relationships for the ombudsman that vary from professional standards
similar variations seem to be occurring with the newly emerging role of the chief ethics compliance officer
have seen org ani za ti ons develop reporting arrangements for the ombudsman that are quite innovative including features that have the potential if structured properly to support independence and neutrality
an example would be splitting supervision and for direct supervision and performance assessment with office while providing funding through office and using the systems support committee as resource for informing oversight
through its advisory oversight of the system as aw hole the system support committee can provide insight into the performance of the office of the ombudsman
at the same time splitting or sharing oversight responsibilities for any role can increase the complexity of oversight and create new potential sources of conflict
believe the organization should avoid any oversight arrangement that conflicts directly with professional standards
one example of this would be placing the ombudsman under the direct supervision of single senior compliance officer
such arrangements create many potential problems for the organization as well as the ombudsman
an organization considering alternative reporting relationships for the ombudsman might start with the principles described in chapter and consider four questions in assessing the proposed arrangement
does the approach in question interfere with the key characteristics of the ombudsman role
bin crease the risk that the courts will not honor assertion of privilege immunity
ce stablish specific responsibility for direct supervision and oversight
decrease acceptance support by the workforce or within the profession
conversely ad is pu te resolution professional advising the organization or staffing role in the system and concerned about proposed oversight structure might start with the principles in chapter and consider the needs and interests of the organization alongside professional standards
the critical challenge is to respect organizational needs and preferences while protecting the key characteristics of the role
internal and external mediation programs internal mediation functions an internal mediation program is designed to allow the parties to an individual dispute to resolve their differences in confidence by mutual agreement through the services of an employee acting as neutral third party and operating independently of the line of supervision
some organizations with comprehensive systems do not have separate formal internal mediation option
some organizations provide informal mediation internally through the ombudsman
oversight for the ombudsman should occur through reporting relationship with senior management as described earlier in this section with attention to the special considerations for key staff professionals described in the last section of this article
some organizations train their human resource managers andor line managers to use mediation skills as tool for problem solving and conflict management in their daily work
this is very powerful but even more informal application which is key element in providing comprehensive approach to conflict management
oversight for the very informal use of mediation skills by line managers and hr professionals occurs through the normal line of supervision as described in the section regarding accountability and oversight of individual employees
few organizations have provided internal mediation programs through pool of trained employees who voluntarily serve as mediators on case by case basis and the discussion below applies only to such formally structured programs for internal mediation
external mediation programs by external mediation programs mean resources designed to allow the parties to an individual dispute to resolve their differences by mutual agreement offered through an independent provider of professional dispute resolution services
for example an organization might contract with local firm providing mediation services or with an association or company providing such services on regional or national basis
typically the provider will offer its services through pool of highly trained and carefully selected professionals who ascribe to standards of practice and ethics set by one or more professional associations
the provider will ordinarily be responsible for the logistical and administrative support associated with its services including meeting facilities and administrative support for its neutrals and for dispute resolution proceedings
such support requirements can be extensive
the provider will also be responsible for managing and evaluating the performance of its neutrals and it services
key features characteristics whether an org ani za ti on is developing oversight alternatives for an internal mediation function on the one hand or for an external mediation option on the other the same two sets of tasks must be monitored one set consists of providing administrative and logistical support for the users or consumers of the services in to the mediations
providing administrative and logistical support might include for example administering any associated employee benefits on behalf of the users collecting and reporting data recording and maintaining any necessary records including formal agreements and decisions and providing physical resources such as appropriate meeting facilities evaluation forms and the like
the other set of tasks involves ensuring that the company or the vendor providing the services as well as the mediators meet professional and organizational standards for performance
another way to approach this question would be to think of the skill sets necessary to provide oversight and again one might think of two sets of qualifications the skills necessary to oversee the management and delivery of complex set of services and the skills necessary to evaluate the performance of the neutrals as well as the performance of the options they staff
oversight of an internal mediation function or of an external mediation option can also require as ign if ic ant commitment of staff time
oversight by program manager the role of program manager if it exits is natural candidate for the oversight of mediation options
some organizations have created such roles to manage internal conflict management program including such responsibilities as supervising options that do not fit neatly into other reporting andor arbitration services would be perfect examples overseeing administrative and logistical services for the program and providing support and coordination for the system as whole
such roles offer the distinct advantage of providing ad ed ic ated resource for oversight
the role is not widely established at present and as ares ult it will not be readily available as an alternative
in addition companies may not be quick to add anew distinct position particularly if the duties may overlap with other existing roles or may be split among them
the essence of the role may begin to show up less formally without separate title example as set of duties assigned alongside other responsibilities to staff professional already serving in the office of general counsel or in ac om pli an ce role
as discussed in the section on oversight for the system as whole organizations wondering how to provide oversight to options such as mediation program might consider establishing an informal version of the program manager role even if the idea of creating and funding new formally designated position is not appealing
an informal program manager role could also provide oversight to internal justice mechanisms and external higher authority options
see table and the discussion below
the mediation option may face some challenges with respect to employee perception if the program manager reports to compliance office but see the discussion immediately below
oversight by compliance officer senior compliance roles offer one possible choice for oversight of mediation options since such roles are designed to address or to solve problems or disputes related to official corporate policies ethical standards and legal requirements
moreover each of these functions is likely to have staff professionals with many of the necessary qualifications for oversight and the resources to commit staff time to the task
one concern heard expressed repeatedly from variety of quarters was the fear that providing oversight for such options via compliance function could have an eg at ive impact on employee perceptions of independence and impartiality reducing the attractiveness of these alternatives
the pluses and minuses of this arrangement re pres en ta tradeoff and oversight by compliance officer may in the end be very practical choice
if those using or involved with the mediation option perceive it as offering high quality neutral and independent dispute resolution services word will travel quickly
the reverse is true as well
informal support for oversight the systems support committee may play an informal role in supporting oversight of internal andor external mediation options
for example primary supervising officer such as program manager or compliance officer has direct responsibility for supervision and oversight of the internal external mediation options
program dedicated resource few organizations have established this role
internal justice mechanisms by internal justice mechanisms mean extraordinary processes designed to offer an impartial and independent mechanism for appealing organizational findings or decisions
use the word extraordinary because am specifically referring to processes that involve review by panel of individuals rather than review by single individual representing successive levels in the line of authority
the word extraordinary also reflects the fact that such processes typically involve far more extensive formal proceedings than traditional internal options operate independently of the normal chain of command and require substantial logistical and administrative support
internal justice mechanisms exist in dizzying number of forms some make only findings of fact while others review managerial decisions some are available only to review disciplinary decisions while others are open to broader range of issues some are advisory in nature while others may reverse or modify organizational decisions or findings of fact that underlie such decisions some involve panels of executives others rely on peers of the appealing party while others still involve mix of executives and peers
external higher authority options by external higher authority options mean processes designed to offer an impartial and independent mechanism for reviewing or appealing organizational findings or decisions offered through an independent provider of professional dispute resolution services
like internal justice mechanisms external higher authority options also exist in wide array of forms they maybe advisory in nature or binding on one or both parties they may be conducted by single highly trained professional or by panel of highly trained professionals and may include simulated review by
the relationship between internal justice mechanism and external higher authority options is parallel to the relationship between internal mediation functions and external mediation options
as with external mediation options an organization might contract with local firm providing arbitration andor other higher authority dispute resolution services or with an association or company providing such services on regional or national basis
in many cases external service providers will provide both mediation and higher authority dispute resolution services
typically the provider will offer its services through of highly trained and carefully selected professionals who ascribe to standards of practice and ethics set by one or more professional associations
the provider will ordinarily be responsible for the logistical and administrative support associated with its services including meeting facilities and administrative support for its neutrals and for dispute resolution proceedings
such support requirements can be extensive
the provider will also be responsible for managing and evaluating the performance of its neutrals and it services
data collection and reporting programs are likely to be under utilized resisted sabotaged or ignored altogether unless they are structured to work well for the organization as whole and for those who must collect and report the data
in other words data collection and reporting programs must be useful efficient and realistic
by useful mean that the evaluation program must be consistent with the values mission and goals of the organization as whole and with the goals that the organization has for the conflict management system itself
suppose for example one of the reasons the organization established the conflict management system was to enhance its reputation asa wonderful place to work or to reduce reliance on formal grievance procedures
the evaluation program should help the organization to assess the role of the system in achieving such goals
by efficient mean that the data collection and reporting program should not get in the way of core mission or business at least not any more than necessary to gather and report useful information
it is often very hard to collect data regarding traditional options such as an open door policy or even regarding compliance options such as human resources or employee relations beyond the most basic information because of the press of everyday business
for example data collection often breaks down at the business unit level because the data collection procedures seem too onerous to the manager focused on the producing goods or services
similarly the mere mention of generating and delivering reports can trigger immediate resistance
data collection and reporting procedures must be designed in way that respects the other obligations and responsibilities of all parties to the process
by realistic mean that the data collection and reporting program should fit with the characteristics of the particular organization and its industry and with the operating procedures and structures
if the organization has busy season for production for example the busy season would probably not be good time for an annual report
similarly data collection and reporting procedures may be very different for an organization operating from one central location as opposed to an organization with highly independent business units operating in three states
finally to make data collection and reporting procedures useful efficient and realistic the evaluation program must be designed with input from all interested parties
in my experience organizations are unlikely to implement program that includes all of the elements set out below
on the other hand an organization might be willing to draw on the elements described here customizing them with input from all interested parties to develop an evaluation program that is useful efficient and realistic
the challenge is to help the organization develop well designed data collection and reporting program based on solid approaches to program evaluation that meets its needs
the goal is program that provides useful information and analysis and program that the organization will implement and execute
such programs can be powerful tool for informing oversight even if less comprehensive in scope than possible data collection if the evaluation program is to be useful in providing oversight for each individual option and for the system as whole data should be collected from each option and from the workforce as whole
for example imagine system with an open door policy human resources function an om buds mana chief ethics compliance officer security department and external mediation and arbitration
in an ideal world the organization would collect data in each option on an ongoing or regular basis
how might the organization collect data from each option
typically each business unit or department will have its own human resources hr manager
the hr manager in each department or unit would probably be responsible for collecting data regarding hr activities in relation to the system
since the open door policy usually proceeds through the chain of command in each business unit the hr manager might also be designated to collect data regarding open door activities in his or her department
the ombudsman would collect data regarding the operations of the office of the ombudsman
staff member of the office of ethics compliance would collect regarding its activities and the same would be true for the security department
the role or function responsible for oversight of the external options should oversee data collection by the external providers and analyze and report regarding those options
the organization should specify the data that it wants collected by the external providers of mediation and arbitration services
it should also provide or assist in designing or at minimum review carefully the data collection instruments and procedures to be used by the external providers
each specialist providing services within the system for example each hr manager or each member of the om buds staff might track activity individual activity on each matter using instruments designed for this purpose so for example hr managers for each business unit might be entering data concerning their activities in relation to the system using as oft ware program or otherwise tracking the information on an instrument designed for the purpose and delivering it to designated person for data entry
the hr managers might also be tracking open door activities for their respective business units departments in the same way
each option might be collecting and entering data in similar fashion
it is critical to note that highly confidential options such as the office of the ombudsman in addition to collecting and entering data separately will need separate databases to protect the confidentiality of the limited information they maintain
at the same time centralization of some aspects of the data collection process can increase the efficiency of the data collection process
examples might include centralization of data entry within each option uniformity in coding categories regarding the types of problems or concerns raised through the system the use of existing organizational codes in collecting data regarding such utilization variables as job code business unit department and the like and the development of uniform instruments or tools for collecting information
data should also be collected from the workforce as aw hole
this might be done through variety of mechanisms such as annual surveys focus groups or web sites
in an annual survey for example which typically covers variety of topics the organization might ask two questions one about knowledge of the conflict management system and one about its effectiveness
the organization could also use focus groups andor web sites to allow employees to rate the effectiveness of the system or of particular options or roles within it in more detail
to offer comprehensive approach to evaluating the conflict management system data collection and reporting should cover processes and outcomes
the key questions with respect to processes will be are the elements components of system in place
are those elements operating as intended
to answer the two key questions regarding process those evaluating the system will need to observe operations interview specialists and review data and reports
the key question with respect to outcomes will be is the system achieving its goals
in controlling the costs of conflict we described four key outcome measures that an organization might collect in each option utilization expenses resolution and satisfaction and an umber of variables that might be collected in relation to each of the four
the data collected regarding processes and outcomes should be analyzed and reported in keeping with evaluation program procedures and used to guide oversight
data analysis and reporting to inform oversight the organization must develop effective procedures for analyzing and reporting the data it collects
this includes procedures through which data from each of the options and from the general workforce can be communicated to those responsible for the oversight of each option in the system as well as to line and staff management throughout the organization to the senior leadership and to the organization at large
it also includes clearly establishing which roles will be responsible for reporting in each option and to whom the reports will be given
in addition it includes establishing the timing frequency and format for reporting as well as the analyses to be performed on the data collected and any standard reports that might be developed
depending on the data collected those responsible for evaluation may be able to provide variety of customized reports as well
regular reports should be supplemented with ad hoc reporting as needed
to stay with the sample system we described at the beginning of this chapter the hr manager in each business unit might be responsible for reporting to the line management of the business unit regarding activity related to the system occurring through the open door policy and human resources
the same hr manager might also be responsible for reporting up the hr chain of command
the ombudsman must have procedures for reporting to the senior line officer responsible for oversight of the om buds function aswell as key line and staff management for each business unit the senior management team the systems support committee and perhaps even the audit committee or the full board
some though not all of this might be done using consolidated comprehensive summary the discussion below
the same is true for other key staff professionals in our hypothetical system such as the chief ethics compliance officer the senior vp for hr security the general counsel and the roles or functions responsible for managing the external options
some specific person or perhaps small team should have responsibility for preparing the analyses and reports to be used for oversight of the system as aw hole and for managing the data collection and reporting program
for example some role or function must be responsible for developing reports for the systems support committee the and the board of directors
suppose for example that either ap rog ram manager or the office of general counsel has responsibility for overseeing the performance of the external options in the hypothetical system the designated officer might also have lead responsibility in consultation with the ombudsman human resources and the general counsel for putting together comprehensive summary reports for the systems support committee the and the board
as with data collection effective reporting procedures often represent sticking point in developing an effective evaluation program
the most difficult problems in developing acceptable effective reporting procedures often occur at the business unit or division level
line managers in particular already overwhelmed with operational responsibilities are likely to resist series of regular briefings with each of the key staff professionals in the system
to offer an example of how an organization might simplify reporting at the business unit level suppose the person responsible for managing the evaluation program develops comprehensive summary reports for the systems support committee the and the board as described above
the same reports could be used to brief the business unit managers
such reports can be customized for use with each business unit
in sum reporting procedures should be designed to be useful efficient and realistic as described at the beginning of this section
the reporting procedures should be kept as clear and as simple as possible while fulfilling the primary goal of informing oversight
and those procedures should capitalize on comprehensive summary reports and regular reports to avoid duplication while supplementing regular reporting with ad hoc reporting as necessary
caveat whatever the reporting procedures and whatever the steps taken to streamline them there simply is no substitute for regular contact between key staff professionals and line and staff managers
regular meetings provide an important avenue through which key staff professionals such as the ombudsman and the chief ethics compliance officer can build relationships with managers throughout the organization
building relationships throughout the organization is critical to the success of such specialists
it is also task much harder to accomplish in the context of resolving individual problems or disputes
use of data collection and reporting to inform oversight how does it look from the perspective of those responsible for providing oversight
the data collection and reporting procedures should provide them with information needed to fulfill their oversight responsibilities
to stay with the imaginary system described at the beginning of this section those responsible for oversight of the individual options in the system should receive regular reports or briefings regarding the option in question
line managers of business units or significant operating divisions should receive regular reports or briefings regarding use of the system in relation to their units as well as concerning particular problems and patterns or trends that might be of interest to them
the systems support committee should receive and review the comprehensive summary reports described in the preceding subsection in anticipation of its regular meetings
the or the senior line officer designated to oversee the system as whole could receive the same comprehensive summary reports prepared for the systems support committee or briefing based on those reports
if the delegates responsibility for management of the system to another senior line officer that officer should provide the and the senior management team with at least annual briefings
those briefings might be based on summaries of the comprehensive report developed for the systems support committee
the or the designated senior line officer should provide even more summary annual briefings to the board of directors
some key roles within the system such as the ombudsman and the chief ethics compliance officer might report directly to the audit committee or the full board on some regular basis
based on the summary reports they receive the andor the board might request more information from the person or role responsible for managing the evaluation program or from those with responsibility for any individual option
finally feedback should be provided to the organization as whole
in other words the workforce should receive information regarding whether the system is operating as intended its success in achieving its goals any trends or systemic problems that have been identified and any resulting action taken by the organization
this can be done through variety of mechanisms including newsletters web sites em ails orientation sessions or summary reports
those responsible for oversight can use the reports described above to identify problems patterns and trends that must be addressed or to encourage the further collection or exchange of information
based on the information provided those providing oversight can also recommend or make appropriate changes in policies operating procedures or practices of the system or of the entire organization depending upon their particular responsibilities
unless the information and analyses provided through data collection and reporting are used to make the changes or improvements identified the evaluation program will have little value
the failure to take action on such reports and recommendations represents not uncommon source of breakdowns for evaluation programs
the organization should develop policies and procedures and assign responsibilities to ensure that the lessons learned from the data collection and reporting program result inappropriate concrete plans for action and that the action plans are executed
data collection and reporting can be use to guide oversight of the individual options as well as of the system as whole
the same reports can be useful tool in evaluating the performance of key professionals staffing the system topic discussed further in the two sections that follow
finally data collection and reporting procedures can provide basis for ensuring that particularly difficult or unusual individual problems receive appropriate attention
the key point is that the information and analysis available thro ug ha data collection and reporting program can provide the basic information and analysis necessary for effective oversight
accountability and oversight of individual employees with comprehensive conflict management system in place each employee has the responsibility in addition to his or her substantive job duties to demonstrate the conflict management skills necessary for the job in question
the necessary skills and responsibilities will vary by job function and level of responsibility
what the organization expects of amar ket ing manager human resources manager an information technology professional and building maintenance technician for example may differ considerably
the conflict management skills and responsibilities needed for each different job in front line employees to staff professionals from senior executives and board members to professionals staffing the conflict management to be specified in the relevant job description and integrated into performance assessment criteria instruments and processes
the net effect should be that for each employee evaluation of success in fulfilling conflict management responsibilities occurs routinely as an incorporated element of assessing job performance
this includes key professionals who staff the conflict management system
roles in the system with certain key characteristics present special challenges regarding accountability and effective oversight
those challenges arise with respect to staff professionals who operate with high degree of autonomy independently of traditional line of supervision report at senior level maintain high levels of confidentiality in providing services and serve on an ongoing rather than case by case basis
such roles may also be new to the organization another factor requiring careful attention
the ombudsman role if designed in keeping with best practice standards embodies all of these characteristics
depending on how it is structured the role of program manager if the system has one may present at least some of the same challenges
some of the same considerations may also apply to newly emerging compliance roles such as the chief ethics compliance officer
oversight of line managers and staff employees operating under traditional line of am including in this category those who staff traditional and compliance does not present the same challenges as long as the organization has clear and constructive performance evaluation procedures in place and as long as those procedures include attention to the in relation to the conflict management system
see the preceding discussion regarding accountability and oversight of individual employees
similarly providing oversight to mediators arbitrators and panelists represents fairly discrete task
standards instruments and procedures for evaluating individual dispute resolution events that involve neutrals such as mediation arbitration and other internal and external higher authority dispute resolution processes are well established and readily available
for professional staff roles involving the key characteristics described above it can be very difficult to know how skillfully or well the professional is performing in individual instances or in general overtime
with respect to the ombudsman in particular professional best practice standards set an extremely high standards for independence neutrality and the confidentiality of communications and call for operating structures and processes to ensure that such standards are met
every aspect of this challenge is magnified if such key staff professionals report to the most senior line officers
such officers are not likely to start with much knowledge of the role or of the skills abilities and knowledge necessary to fill it
in addition day today responsibilities of senior line officers are exceptionally demanding as are their schedules limiting the opportunities for interaction and for oversight
at the same time the organization has the right and the responsibility to ensure accountability
the very characteristics that make these key staff professionals so effective and valuable can cause organizational leadership to can we possibly know what is going on with such role
how can we hold such the person who holds it accountable
why should we even create such position
key challenge is that such roles require lot of leeway in terms of autonomy and the opportunity to operate in confidence with limited observation
the dilemma has been the absence of an oversight structure that ensures accountability meeting needs while protecting the key characteristics of the role
one solution to this dilemma is to create is to create structure for oversight around the role that that addresses key elements of supervision and performance assessment and that provides the supervisor with data that can inform oversight from an array of sources
establishing such structure requires extra attention to number of considerations described in this section
some standard elements of effective supervision and performance evaluation become doubly important with respect to roles that operate with great autonomy and independence on highly confidential basis
particularly when such roles are new to the organization or when the conflict management system itself is new or the product of significant change effective oversight may be weakened or limited if any one of several basic standard elements is not addressed reporting relationships the reporting relationship including the responsibility of the supervising officer to evaluate performance must be clearly specified
in my experience political considerations or turf battles related to highly autonomous independent roles can turn issues such as funding reporting relationships and responsibility to evaluate performance into sources of conflict
the result can be lack of clarity regarding key details or temporary arrangements compromises or informal understandings that are unsettled or not very workable
similar problems can occur in rush to establish new system or to implement significant changes to an existing one
performance evaluation criteria instruments and procedures it is equally important to develop and implement clear well designed performance evaluation criteria instruments and procedures
developing performance assessment processes and tools for roles that involve such wide range of skills and abilities can be complex task calling for extra attention
the need for extra care is only increased when creating high level roles new to the organization
establishing carefully developed performance criteria will be very important to the success of the supervising officer in providing oversight and conducting the evaluation process
ensuring that the performance criteria are folded into well designed instruments and evaluation procedures is equally important
attention to these elements becomes even more critical if as described above establishment of the role in question has bee na source of conflict or the product of rushed effort
performance assessment training accountability and support training for the supervising officer and processes designed to establish accountability and support for supervision also deserve extra attention
providing oversight can be difficult and even intimidating if the supervisor does not clearly understand what the supervisee actually does or how
even more so if the supervisor relies on the employee in question for information on emerging problems patterns and trends
all of these additional elements are likely to be present in supervising professionals who operate autonomously and in confidence and who provide specialized forms of assistance requiring an extensive set of skills
the supervisor will need clear understanding of the role in question the relevant professional standards and the necessary skills abilities and knowledge
supervisors also need clear understanding of the objectives set for the role and for the office or program in question
supervisors may also need tobe educated regarding how to provide supervision which can be tricky when the professional in question operates independently and often in confidence
opportunities for direct observation or interaction between supervisee and supervisor may be more limited than they would be for other roles
appropriate opportunities for interaction and or observation should be identified along with other sources of data to inform oversight
for example careful review of the reports of the office in question along with other reports such as the summary comprehensive reports regarding the performance of the system as the section on data collection also provide important information and insight
in short the demands of supervising and evaluating key staff professionals may require extra education for the supervisor regarding the role and the elements of evaluation process
the challenge of providing oversight can also be greater if the organization does not have well established systems and processes to support supervision and regular evaluation
this includes procedures processes or standards designed to encourage or prompt the supervising officer to provide ongoing supervision to conduct regular performance evaluations to provide the supervising officer with supporting tools resources and information and to hold the responsible officer accountable for oversight responsibilities
for example the systems support committee can be ava lu able tool for supporting oversight through its regular and ongoing information exchange through its data analysis and reporting and through any advisory recommendations it might make
the use of independent evaluators as described in the section on oversight of the system as whole is yet another way to support the supervising officer and to provide another source of data for use in evaluating performance
use of satisfaction data to inform oversight the greater the degree of autonomy associated with aro le and the higher the level of confidentiality associated with its services the harder it can be to assess the performance of those who staff it
as noted above careful review of relevant information from the data collection and reporting program can supply important information and context
one particular type of data that may be available through such programs satisfaction data can be valuable supplemental source of information for informing oversight
before describing its potential value want to stress the how these data might be used and some limitations satisfaction ratings represent only one source of data for informing performance assessment and oversight such ratings must be used in context to inform the overall evaluation
the performance evaluation should be based on carefully developed role description based in turn on the skills abilities knowledge and experience necessary to do the job
so for example satisfaction data from institutional users see below might help to inform the supervisor in rating key staff professional regarding his or her ability to and maintain positive and effective working relationships with peers colleagues and fellow employees
using satisfaction data in context also means remembering as some experts have noted that satisfaction data are subjective
this requires the supervising officer in considering the data to take into account the nature and dynamics of the relationships between those providing feedback and the office of the ombudsman
any given individual satisfaction rating might be colored by variety of factors related to elements of the situation other than the performance of the ombudsman
considering satisfaction data in context also means taking into account that parties may not take advantage of the opportunity to provide it
the percentage of parties who provide satisfaction data may be low which may also limit its value for informing oversight
the potential value of satisfaction data as an additional source of information in evaluating the performance of key staff professionals does not mean that satisfaction data should not be collected regarding traditional and compliance functions
satisfaction data for traditional and compliance options can be collected from employees using some of the same approaches suggested here
at the same time since those staffing traditional and compliance options operate with much less autonomy and since those options offer far lower level of confidentiality satisfaction data may be less critical to assessing performance or to providing balance against the independence of such roles
such data are also likely to be more readily available for the same reasons
in addition the cost in dollars and time of evaluation procedures and the preferences with respect to the extensiveness of those procedures will have lot to do with the collection and use of such data
for example suspect that an organization would be unlikely to develop evaluation procedures that include satisfaction ratings by institutional consumers see below for all internal staff professionals such as human resources employee relations legal staff officers and security to offer some examples
as noted earlier in this section model processes and tools for providing oversight to mediators arbitrators and panelists which include the use of satisfaction data are well established and readily available
moving past the qualifiers believe that satisfaction data can be more valuable source of information for enriching the picture with respect to performance although more complicated to collect
no role operates with higher degree of autonomy or honors higher standard of confidentiality which means it can be very hard to know how well the om buds is doing in assisting parties or in fulfilling her responsibilities in general
satisfaction data are also highly valuable because the ombudsman serves on an ongoing basis rather than case by case basis and has responsibilities to the organization as whole as well as to individual parties
as result the ombudsman must build and maintain relationships with employees across the organization and satisfaction data offer one source of information with respect the success in this regard
collecting satisfaction data can be more complicated because contact with the ombudsman maybe more indirect including anonymous telephone calls and because any given matter might involve parties from all levels and divisions of the organization interacting over long period of time rather than in discrete proceeding
again some of the same considerations may apply to other key staff roles such as the program manager or chief ethics compliance officer
given the potential value of satisfaction data as one tool for informing oversight and performance assessment of the ombudsman believe the organization should develop comprehensive approach to collecting it as one element in its data collection and reporting program
every party who has contact with the office of the ombudsman regarding any matter ought to have an avenue for rating its performance
so for example any person contacting the office wit ha question concern or request for assistance ought tobe able to assess its performance
similarly any person responding to any inquiry from the office or any party to matter in which the ombudsman is involved ought to have the opportunity to assess the performance of the office and its staff
the general population can be surveyed to assess its knowledge of the office and its satisfaction with the services that office provides
mechanisms developed to allow anonymous parties or the general workforce to rate satisfaction such as web sites focus groups or employee surveys can be tools for collecting satisfaction data regarding any and all options in the system
in addition because of the responsibilities of the ombudsman to build and maintain relationships across the organization to work closely and well with virtually every unit or department and to act as an advocate for systemic change there is another category of users who should be invited to consumers
by institutional consumers mean those who regularly use or rely on the services of the ombudsman or who regularly interact with the ombudsman on behalf of some function or department within the organization
for example what do the senior line managers who are responsible for the system as whole think of his performance
what about the line managers who regularly interact with the om buds on behalf of their business units
what about the professionals who staff other options in the system such as human resources security or the legal department
the relationships among these functions are often critical to the performance of the om buds and to his success in achieving his goals
satisfaction ratings from institutional users provide one of the few sources of information regarding the and skill in balancing conflicting elements of the abilities to operate independently and to preserve confidences for example against the ability to build and maintain constructive effective long term relationships
in sum key staff roles that operate in confidence and with great deal of autonomy are absolutely critical to the system
at the same time such roles present special challenges when it comes to ensuring accountability and assessing performance
believe the best approach is to create structure around the role that that addresses key elements of supervision and performance assessment and that provides the supervisor with data that can inform oversight from an array of sources
to create this structure believe the organization should pay special attention to establishing every element of the reporting relationship as well as to performance assessment criteria instruments and procedures and to performance assessment training accountability and support
many of these elements of the oversight structure are basic but they must be tailored and enhanced for oversight of key staff roles such as the ombudsman
providing the supervisor with data from an array of sources is the other key component is creating such astr uc tu re
reports generated by the office in question summary comprehensive reports on the operation of the system as whole and the information exchange generated through the systems support committee offer valuable resources for informing oversight
satisfaction data used in context can be one particularly useful type of data given the nature of key staff roles
satisfaction data from institutional consumers in particular can be very helpful in assessing judgment and skill in balancing conflicting elements of the role
finally the organization should be alert for new tools that might support oversight
for example in the future scenario based performance assessment might offer new source of information for assessing the performance of the ombudsman
in my experience most of the discussions regarding oversight of conflict management systems have either been relation to individual options or roles within the system or an discussion about the components of its system or whether to implement something new
by considering overlapping principles and best practices from corporate governance management organizational theory and conflict management an organization can develop comprehensive model for oversight
believe some basic principles and account abilities rather than one specific design can provide starting point
based on those principles an organization can create flexible framework for oversight through series of interrelated procedures and mechanisms the or specifically designated member of the senior management team is responsible for managing the system as whole in consultation with senior management team
key staff roles designed to operate independently of the chain of command and to ensure employee access to senior management andor the board report directly to the or to specifically designated senior line officer with access to the board on an as needed basis
the board of directors actively oversees the supervision provided by senior management
by assuming number of duties related to coordination communication and management of systemwide services or functions key staff professionals can serve as central supporting resources for the entire system
systems support committee also supports oversight of the system as whole by promoting information sharing and feedback throughout the organization
independent evaluators and relationships with professional associations and governmental entities provide additional information and external support
reporting relationships are the basis for direct supervision of individual options within the system
assigning oversight responsibility for each individual option to specifically designated supervising function or role ensures the accountability of the option and of those who staff it
these reporting relationships are established with attention to the key features of each option and support efficient operation of the system and the organization as whole
comprehensive data collection and reporting program informs management and oversight
oversight of individual employees occurs through the line of supervision as an incorporated element of supervision and performance assessment
to enhance and support oversight each employee receives an introduction to the system as well as skills training geared to his or her respective roles and responsibilities
skills training is also integrated into professional development programs to encourage employees to develop the new conflict management skills necessary for new roles
the organization also uses such skills training programs as tool for assessing the readiness of employees for more complicated or specialized roles making such programs another tool for oversight
the organization provides oversight to key staff professionals by creating structure around such roles
that structure addresses key elements of supervision and performance assessment and provides the supervisor with data that can inform oversight from an array of sources
the structure is developed with attention to the special considerations that apply to roles that operate in confidence with great deal of autonomy
this approach allows the organization to ensure accountability without compromising the key characteristics of the role
the result can be flexible comprehensive framework for oversight that mirrors the comprehensive nature of the underlying system
the framework and the principles that underlie it should accommodate the innovation and experimentation that will undoubtedly occur as organizations adapt oversight procedures to their individual cultures and operating environments and to changing conditions
the goal should be effective oversight that meets the needs of the organization and that is consistent with principles of corporate governance and management and respectful of best practice standards in conflict management
hope this approach will also encourage discussion and research
those three discussion and help organizations and the full range of interested parties move beyond the suggestions presented here

rupert mcg il li cuddy the coo of global manufacturing was alarmed and upset
he came in monday morning to find that chris lee the computer systems wizard had quit over the weekend
lee was in the second and crucial year of adapting and implementing new international inventory tracking and control system
no one else understood the not yet fully documented system as well as lee
lee also was unique in another respect
as child he had learned the several languages and dialects of his four grandparents
fortuitously this had made him into of gem for global management system was being built together with teams in three of those language areas
mcg il li cuddy made few quiet phone calls
he was dismayed by the information that came back
it seemed that lee was quiet and devout person who had been uncomfortable working with the head of it greg gar io us
sense of humor was described asa bit crude
it appeared that greg made jokes about everyone
one of his many jokes was about the fact that four grandparents came from four different countries
many people had heard these jokes parentage and multiple personalities apparently no one had remonstrated with greg
mcg il li cu dy was told there had been gossip about greg for years different issues
there was as ug gestion that greg made merry when on travel
there was story about dare devil driving
there were whispers about his receiving recreational drugs from one of the vendors and with his staff
hr said they had not investigated any concerns about never had complaint
the authors wish to thank the many dozens of om buds in the east coast om buds group and in workshops who contributed to this study over ten year period
we thank editor alan lincoln associate editor tom james lee and bruce jacobson and timothy ro we for very helpful comments
greg had allegedly bought the new inventory system from vendor where he was said to be the relevant sales representative
someone said the woman was cousin others thought it was cousin
one person supposedly had thought the sales rep was mistress
when that person had supposedly asked supervisor in purchasing about this apparently no one had looked into possible conflict of interest
the rumor mill said that the supervisor in purchasing had simply asked greg and the sales vendor had the same last name
had told everyone that he had chosen the new inventory control system because it cost less than others
however it appeared that chris lee had determined that the staffing model had been grossly underestimated
might greg have underestimated the staffing to make his choosing this inventory control system look better
when presenting public report about the new computer system greg blamed the staffing problem on the of his computer systems staff
when woman who worked for chris lee had then raised her hand another department manager had whispered that she should cool it because there was no time at the meeting to discuss details
mcg il li cuddy was told that his managers wanted to do the right thing but they simply did not know what to do
they did not know how to evaluate the significance of the gossip and concerns
they seemed afraid to bring attention to something that spelled trouble they felt there might have been
the problems seemed the easiest response
computer systems staff said that chris lee had felt deeply humiliated by comment had added insults to injury
to the car radio on friday morning mc gul li cuddy heard someone quoting speech by ase ni or national security expert only answer for electronic systems protection is training and earning the loyalty of could enable in government or the private sector
mcg il li cuddy immediately called his general counsel
these it rumors possibly be true or is it all contemptible gossip
is there anything more to learn
could you please do real investigation here
and if there was problem why was not told about this
people in organizations often see behavior that they think is unacceptable unsafe
why do people who observe such behavior hesitate to act on their own or to come when affected by that behavior
why do they not immediately report those whom they see to be acting in an unacceptable fashion
hesitation of this kind has been recognized for years for example there is controversial literature with simple explanations about the effect
inreality hesitation is not confined just to bystanders and it is not simple
people in all roles may hesitate to act
why do some many rather than acting effectively to stop behavior they find to be unacceptable
to add to the puzzle some people do act on the spot or come forward when they see unacceptable behavior
the topic is important to all those who would like abetter understanding of why truly unacceptable behavior continues
if people fear to act when they see unacceptable behavior or otherwise find it is not in their interests to take action then employers can learn why this is so and think about specific responses
if people do want to act but feel powerless then an employer may help by providing options
the limitations of this study we took wide angle perspective rather than focusing tightly on testable hypotheses
we were tracking all kinds of perceived misbehavior rather than just one kind
we use the terms and to refer to any behavior that was judged to be unacceptable by people who came to om buds offices in many different organizations
we realize that scientific study might find that people deal differently with different issues
by the same token people might behave differently at different times
and some might act on the spot or report unacceptable behavior but not both
this study simply pulls together all the reasons that were reported to us for not taking action or for taking action about unacceptable behavior
the data presented here are not drawn from surveys or sample of employees and managers
the data are drawn from of thousands of visitors who contacted dozens of om buds offices ten year period
we were not attempting to assess the efficacy of single complaint procedure
we report instead some perceptions of the context in which people find themselves and also their comments about themselves
we are aware that new research in neuroscience suggests that many decisions are made intuitively or unconsciously and that people often do not know let alone report truthfully why they make the decisions that they make
we also believe that many small errors and transgressions should simply be ignored and forgiven and that some people in fact complain too much
we hope it may nevertheless be useful to present what people report about their inactions and their actions
the goals of this study we present what people say about why they do not act or do act hoping to be useful to academics to employers to policy makers and especially to om buds practitioners and other human resource professionals
we present long list of self reports as to why people do not act and short list about why they do
we are aware that academic research studies have already affirmed many of the self reports presented here and hope there will be more such research
we hope that employers may be able to read through these self reports for ones that will be relevant in their own organizations
it is important for policy makers who are concerned about illegal behavior to consider wide range of barriers to coming forward
we hope that om buds practitioners and other human resource professionals who are faced with person who refuses to come forward will be willing to listen to all the concerns and interests that the visitor might have
we hope that this article will make it easier to develop options that address the specific interests of the individuals who see unacceptable behavior so these individuals may find it easier to take appropriate action
many people clearly do not want to take action when they see unacceptable behavior and many see nothing unreasonable about their point of view
society may determine that certain behavior is unacceptable or declare it to be illegal
employers make policies in accord with their own values and the law
however employees and managers may have conflicting interests to consider as they decide how to react to unacceptable behavior
they may want to stop or report behavior they see as balance they may not want to
they may even not want to learn the rules
many barriers we report on two sets of interact with each other perceptions about the organizational context and managers and personal factors
most people consciously or intuitively consider the context when they perceive behavior that they think is wrong
they may consider the also the actual their organization about acting on the spot or forward
they may review their own and their perceptions of the local supervisor
they may consciously or intuitively evaluate their complaint system and its options in terms of safety accessibility and credibility
recent events may also affect actions
personal factors include how people understand the issues at hand their personal preferences gender and cultural traditions and their perceived power or lack of power
people also may behave differently depending on their role in the an injured part ya perpetrator supervisor senior officer peer
of the organization many people say they fear that happen if they take action with respect to unacceptable behavior
one traditional understanding of this fear is not entirely is that people hesitate to act because they are afraid of classic retaliation
legislators have responded by requiring employers to prohibit retaliation but this may not help very much
forbidding retaliation is morally important but for at least two reasons the proscription is not very effective
the first is that very few people understand or trust such policy
retaliation is hard to prevent and hard to prove especially where the retaliation is delayed indirect diffuse outside the workplace or covert
the second reason is that classic retaliation is only one of many fears
people fear whole panorama of consequences for speaking up
one purpose of this article is to illuminate the wide scope of possible negative consequences that are reported by employees and also by managers
in addition to various fears how do employees and managers describe their thinking when they hesitate to take responsible action
one of my managers is the local managers have the most risk do not have enough resources to deal with am loyal to the diversity and affinity group loyalty one of my managers is the problem some man ag ers are perceived to lack integrity and some are dishonest
some managers are believed to be unwilling to pay to remove serious safety hazards
some managers are thought to engage in bribery blackmail discrimination harassment intimidation or conflicts of interests
some are arbitrary and cannot be predicted
incidents may have disclosed that managers have been misrepresenting or disguising wrongful behavior
vague reports that hide human costs kickbacks and losses or that coverup widely disparate perks and have set the stage for distrust
local managers seem to have the most influence employers often communicate that they do to hear what is going wrong
ac hi ef executive may say illegal behavior and the local manager may be heard to say these times of lay off we will be keeping those who keep their minds on the job
wherever the immediate interests of local managers do not overlap with the public rhetoric of the employer there will be mixed messages about coming forward
some senior officers are believed to approve it to get the job if their local employees and managers behave in an unacceptable way in order to meet high goals
it is common to reward productive managers who are very problematic as supervisors
one hears of harsh taskmasters who achieve impossible deadlines by abusing employees vendors and others
managers like this may feel and act powerful and enjoy their power
they may be unaware they are behaving in an unacceptable way or alternatively they may enjoy the fact that others are intimidated
either way people may say manager will never change because he is being rewarded for it
employees may report that the manager is and being compensated well in terms of money and in terms of recognition and signals from the top are clear
organizational rules may not matter if the local manager is blind to unacceptable behavior since the local manager is the person who can reward or punish
an influential unit head may make decision or give an order or simply have brusque demeanor such that most people are discouraged from responsible action
sometimes unit head is very direct ie ver hear that someone from my unit has brought apr obl em outside this unit will see that they regret it
unit manager simply does not know what is going on has just arrived on the scene because of reassignments is completely exhausted or listens only to good news
risk management virtually all managers pursue ac on scious or unconscious strategy in which competing values are weighed
there are not enough resources to pursue every possible concern
in addition no one would actually want every manager and employee to speak up every time they are offended by world would grind to aha lt
most supervisors pursue this kind of approach to hearing complaints
are so swamped with work and the deadlines are so it worth it to pursue this concern
and the team strong emphasis on productive teams cultivating loyalty and image of the employer may inhibit person from speaking up
many teams have been taught to on their own as part of delegating decisions to the level of the team
many professionals and managers are expected to handle their conflicts on their own
peer or bystander may wish not to an otherwise perfect record for the team
bystander also may not want to get well liked senior manager in trouble if that person did not know of the problem
by the same token if an employer holds supervisors strictly accountable senior supervisor may not report illegal behavior for fear that it will reflect badly on his or her own performance and that it might reflect on other managers in the line of supervision
in addition sometimes person will not speak of apr obl em because it attaches to situation or project that is tightly held confidential or hidden from public view by security regulations
stoicism many people are taught to it in the face of adversity
especially if times are hard teammates may think just have to get boss does not want to hear bad news
if at eam mate misbehaves or is exhausted to the point of creating an unsafe work environment bad behavior may be ignored in the environment or people may say have only one bad it or understandable under these extreme circumstances or have been through worse than this and we survived it
and globalization sometimes person does not speak up because the employer places strong emphasis on cross cultural tolerance or effective work on an international team
will be misunderstood will not look good will be called and will probably be ignored as well if ic om plain about that person who is not like me
working outside their own culture may be dependent on successful globalization and be reluctant to criticize others
affinity group loyalty group among professionals or union members or senior managers may inhibit action
this also may be true among clan or family members among members of the same ethnic or age group or the same gender
this may happen if an ingroup member who is misbehaving is also performing very well in otherways
affinity group members may be blind to the unacceptable behavior
cannot believe that he would do anything if he did do it surely he did not really mean it
besides it makes no sense for person like him to do thing like this
in addition when someone who is not member of given affinity group feels harassed by member of the ingroup the affinity group may underestimate how painful it is
this will be especially true if the group members do not like the person who is not member of their group
people may say deserves anything she gets if the person who is getting hurt is not performing well or if she has behaved badly in the past or if she frightens other people
ignoring ugly behavior that is not overtly requiring conclusive proof of an alleged important people get treated very no one understands our complaint the complaint system procedures are not zero tolerance policies sometimes policies and procedures convey mixed messages
for example an employer may say that it expects all unacceptable behavior to be many aspects of the complaint system are viewed with distrust
current events may exacerbate this distrust
some sources of distrust include ignoring ugly behavior that is not overtly illegal some employers will only complaints if the behavior is obviously illegal and actually at the workplace
examples of problematic behavior which might be to the employer include paying two white male professionals grossly inequitably for the same work when one is bullying someone who is not of protected class grossly crude behavior toward person who is not
and even stalking or assault may be ignored if offenses by employees happen away from the work site and especially if they happen far from headquarters
offenses may be overlooked if like heavy drinking pornographic movies and sexual partying they are seen to be part of high his private life at an off site everyone is expected to attend
offenses also maybe overlooked even if they are patterns of offenses if they are not public knowledge or if they are subjective in nature or does and harm was intended
immediate and conclusive proof of an alleged offense the need for credible evidence is ase rio us concern when someone brings serious complaint
responsible employers must safeguard the rights of alleged offenders
however extreme attitudes about evidence may constitute barrier for complaints
the word of an offended person or ac on cerned bystander sometimes is just ignored unless there are multiple em ails records fingerprints photos audiotapes videotape on you tube or prominent witnesses immediately available
an employer may be reluctant about fact finding if it could be publicly embarrassing or if an investigation would cost lot or if thorough investigation might involve people outside the organization or require forensic evidence and if the problem seems peculiar or complex and hard to assess
ironically employers may be reluctant to launch investigations if problem is thought to have persisted for very long time
they may fear to discover evidence of long term misbehavior about which action should have been taken
the result may be that many people suffer before the organization will do an investigation
important people get treated very differently in every organization some people are seen to be more believable than others
people whose work is seen tobe good persons of shared and background people in certain job categories and those ona fast track may be seen to be particularly
who is not on the high credibility list may not have the same access to report unacceptable behavior or the same ability to act effectively on the spot when they perceive unacceptable behavior
in addition important people may be protected if others complain of their behavior
one understands our complaint an employer may say that it reports of unacceptable in fact be it therefore lacks comprehensible consistent policies and procedures
or it may fail to train employees and managers
the complaint system procedures are not for reasons of accountability and control an employer may insist that all complaints go through prescribed process
this process however may not be comfortable for employees of certain ethnic or class background or given gender
sometimes ac om plaint must be in writing with copies
sometimes the intake person seems to act as if it is the complainant who is the problem
some intake people are uncomfortable around people unlike themselves
some systems do not permit complainant to bring an person
sometimes the complaint process is convoluted and seems to take is not respected
sometimes an appeals process requires going up the ladder to the very people who are seen to be the problem
in multinational and otherwise highly dispersed organizations accessibility may be restricted by geography
in the complex world of today it is often difficult to understand where and how to bring multi cohort multi jurisdiction problem
zero tolerance policies ignoring complaints will discourage reporting as noted above
strict policy creates problems at the other end of the is zero tolerance also discourages some reporting of illegal behavior
this is true for several reasons
in order to gain control over criminal behavior and to be seen to be doing so an employer may require everyone to report such behavior
the employer may also require formal investigation of complaints
it may also prescribe just one or two options for reporting usually line management and compliance office
and it may require punishment of proven offenses
however many people were brought up to solve their problems themselves do not wish to be tattletales are in fact expected by the manager deal conflicts would prefer to act effectively on their own to resolve any problem
many do not wish to get other people fired or be seen to get others into trouble
many do not trust the employer to do fair investigation
as result zero tolerance policies may inhibit reporting
many require confidential or anonymous options for seeking advice and for reporting
zero tolerance policies do not mix well with many of the to coming forward see below
there is therefore powerful tension between solved efficiently at the lowest by helping people to act on their delegating significant proportion of trying to establish complete control over all unacceptable behavior by centralizing conflict management
the employer must manage balance between encouraging people to act on their own and requiring them to report all unacceptable behavior
some workable balance is also required between individual complainants and compliance offices between compliance officers and line managers between managers and those who report to them and also between headquarters and autonomous subsidiaries or field offices
workable balance requires offering safe options in the complaint system
if the dilemmas are managed badly by providing too few options and zero tolerance may offer no options fewer people will come forward
loss of privacy and fear of fear of other do not have enough it is important for me to keep my head down for too exhausted too busy formidable dislike of formal my employer will do my employer will lack of someone else will take fear of becoming responsible for the things will work loss of professional wrongdoers and potential wrongdoers have few people prefer covert revenge individuals like employers pursue conscious or unconscious approach in which competing interests are weighed
virtually everyone who notices unacceptable behavior hesitates at least briefly about coming forward or otherwise acting effectively
this is true for supervisors senior officers peers and bystanders those who injured by the behavior and perpetrators
there are many personal barriers and they are often complex
the most commonly reported reasons for hesitation are fear of loss of relationships and loss of privacy fear of unspecified or retaliation and insufficient evidence
people may be particularly hesitant if they are required by organizational policy to define unacceptable behavior in terms of illegality and immorality
privacy and relationships almost everyone who perceives serious problem within an organization thinks first about losing their privacy and about damaging their personal and professional relationships
people report fear of losing relationships with the problem person with coworkers and supervisors and future also with family and friends
this is especially true in cultures where people do not confront issues or people head on and where families and friends may blame person for rocking the boat or their head out
people have been taught not to be tattletales
bystanders including managers may especially fear that friends may turn on them your business
some people who have been abused in childhood may especially fear loss of privacy and loss of relationships
in addition people have different points of view
many people are in fact not offended by behavior that seems intolerable to others even if the behavior is illegal
those who are not offended are particularly unlikely to risk their relationships by coming forward
fear of reprisal especially if person believes that his or her direct supervisor is the cause of the problem he or she may fear classic by the employer
in addition many will believe in more subtle consequences for example that their careers might mysteriously stall even if they are not
even in the rare circumstance where people are overtly commended for coming forward they may believe they will thereafter be sidelined
even if the employer highlights is not common thing to people trust such policy
surprising number of people are afraid for their physical safety
many people know that the employer and the police and the courts cannot protect them and their families from vengeful manager or coworker
this fear may be much more acute if there is any chance that the apparent offender will be fired
few people believe that an employer can actually prevent covert delayed indirect subtle or retaliation for example the kind of reference that offers faint or irrelevant praise
many forms of retaliation leave little trace
in addition person may fear retaliation by third by coworkers gossip by colleagues in another institution angry criticism from neighbors punishment by af rie nd of the offender
fear of retaliation is especially common among contract workers and in multinational and international the work force is very fluid and very diverse and where there are fewer long term relationships to build trust
fear of retaliation becomes very acute in bad economic times and in areas where there is high unemployment rate
fear of reprisal is especially painful for those who have no position
single breadwinners and foreign workers who have no options for comparable job are especially vulnerable
those who fear reprisal may argue openly for silence
public trust in policies may be further compromised by the fact that few people who come forward may themselves be poor employees subject to progressive disciplinary action
if such person is demoted or fired coworkers often believe the action took place because the person up
this kind of misunderstanding can also happen if someone is disciplined whom people erroneously thought was whistle blower
widespread layoffs also undermine trust because sometimes people who get laid off
the message that is received may can get away with being an inadequate employee but only so long as you do not reveal our mistakes and problems
also sometimes happens that careers in fact get sidelined or ended or whistle blower is punitively laid off
even one such case if widely discussed may undermine trust throughout an organization
fear of overt and covert retaliation may also be especially marked if external regulators appear to be antagonistic and take humiliating approach to investigation
interactions with the media also may affect the fears of employees and managers
fear of other losses coming forward sometimes leads to serious losses even if there is no retaliation and even when reports of unacceptable behavior are handled perfectly
the company may suffer financially or even go bankrupt
goods may have to be recalled
close work team or wonderful boss may be reassigned
insufficient evidence some people may feel concern about are not certain that there actually is problem or that it is serious problem
not know the rules well enough
will wait until it happens again
or they may not be certain who it is that is behaving badly
some people do not want to admit even to themselves that bad thing has happened or think it may have been an error
people who see problem fear they will not be believed
most feel they lack sufficient evidence in situation of word against mine especially if apr obl em person is of high status
bystanders often consider quitting or transfer before thinking about coming forward because of the problem
this problem is especially serious if the bystander belongs to nontraditional group and members of the organization are seen to be racist sexist etc
it is important for me to keep my head down for now am just going to wait for new boss to come along
if speak up right now on this one may lose my effectiveness on bigger things the next time around or lose my
am the only person who actually knows what has been happening here so got to stay here and wait until the time is right
exhausted too busy desensitized some people who perceive problem are in serious distress or and do not want to invite more stress or distraction or overload by raising an issue
this problem is truly severe for senior managers as well as for junior employees
many people believe that successfully pursuing grievance will require af or mid able commitment of time and soul and resources
many employees are reluctant to lose focus at work be distracted derail the team or time on the job
people may also get detached and desensitized about unacceptable if they are exhausted and especially if managers use euphemisms to describe the unacceptable behavior
the observer then will be all the more unwilling to lose time from work
formidable dislike of formal investigations most people truly hate formal fact is often underestimated
in every organization there will be minority of employees and managers who do believe in formal complaint options and who like them
but large majority will be very hesitant about formal options
those who despise investigations are of course reluctant to provoke or be seen to prov ok ea formal finding of fact
since employees may believe that anything reported to supervisor has to be formally investigated they may be especially reluctant to the boat
some people think the employer will not act to address misconduct
they think reporting problem is pointless especially if the problem person is well respected or powerful or brings in lot of money or is seen to have gotten away with bad behavior in the past
among the star performers are tolerated here and sometimes even has happened in the past
lack of trust in the organization is very common especially if morale is low in whole unit
lack of trust also grows in times when prominent politicians religious leaders and corporate leaders are seen to be unscrupulous
recent events can be very important in sowing
the idea that complaint is useless is worsened by the fact that most employers do not let the workplace know if justice has been served after complaint has been made
many people therefore assume happens and that the consequences to the complainant will be painful
there is another reason why employees may not trust senior management
lower level employees who know that problems exist often presume that senior managers know what is going on when this is not true
senior people are usually quite insulated and many are geographically dispersed
some are ill informed about real problems in the are incompetent
as result people may wrongly believe that manager knowingly tolerates or even approves of unacceptable behavior
employer will overreact some people also do not want the employer to too much
they the problem solved but do not want anyone punished
this will especially be true if damage is already task now is to minimize damage and get on with it
the employer will do too little and that the employer may do too real dilemma for employers
this dilemma is one of the reasons why conflict management system needs informal as well as formal options
lack of skills some people feel they do not have the skills to express themselves or pursue complaint or that they lack sufficient understanding of complex rules
many have no idea about the resources available to help them or do not trust the resource people to act prudently
is no one to listen and help me know what to do
this is especially problem if it is in job description to stop this behavior
many us work places there is in fact no one with the to listen so an offended person may not be able to find safe advisor inside the organization
someone else will take action many people simply assume that someone close to the do something about it
or they may decide not to act no one else has taken action
these beliefs are the traditional explanation for the controversial effect
as we see in this study these two barriers to action are only two of many possible they are not always important
fear of becoming responsible for the problem some people may fear to become legally liable if they admit they know of problem or that people will think that now they are responsible for taking care of the problem
things will work out many people simply presume everything will work out ok in the end if there are some problems along the way
of professional image some people fear being seen as troublemaker or thin skinned or obsessed or lacking in of humor
they do not want to lose professional image especially if they feel injured but appear not to have been an intentional target
not going to take this is just ignorant
and potential wrongdoers the reasons why wrongdoers do not come forward are numerous
some perpetrators of course know that they have been at fault enjoy the fruits of their transgressions and simply want to avoid punishment or being forced to make restitution
some people have been bribed or blackmailed not to report illegal behavior
this people may not come forward to report someone offense because they do not want their own behavior to come to light
some people are afraid that admitting one of their mistakes might illuminate whole pattern of unacceptable and illegal behavior
people who have injured themselves or others may feel too humiliated to act or come forward
some people may rightly or wrongly believe that they colluded with perpetrator and allowed that person to behave illegally
this is ac om mon belief with regard to sexual behavior did not say is all my fault
this belief is also common with respect to theft accepting kickbacks unsafe work conditions failures to stop discrimination and failure to do work as specified by code or contract
some wrongdoers may just recently have realized that they themselves acted in the past in wrongful manner
they may not have been sufficiently aware of social rules or the they now realize their own culpability and want to protect themselves by keeping quiet
some made their mistakes by accident and are afraid of the consequences
some feel rules are rules do not apply to me
some believe they never will get caught
as ign if ic ant number believe perhaps almost unconsciously that god really wanted me to stop would be stopped
people have family members who stop them from reporting their faults
some wrongdoers and some of their friends say guilty is punishment enough
many wrongdoers do not act appropriately or come forward because they do not know how to apologize or make amends
few people prefer covert revenge people who feel let down humiliated or betrayed by manager may feel they no longer need to be loyal to their organization and may seek revenge
they plan on dropping dime to government agency posting gossip in chat room or video on you tube putting up anonymous graffiti or posters
some including targets of unacceptable behavior would prefer to trap the wrongdoer with cell phone recorder or camera even if such trap is illegal
their purpose is to settles cores not to support the employer by acting promptly
american bar association standards organizational om buds classical om buds legislative om buds executive om buds advocate om buds
the word leaves many scratching their heads
despite the extraordinary growth in the profession many individuals either do not know the term or are confused by the various types of om buds
the dictionary defines an ombudsman as who works for government or large organization and deals with the complaints made against it
but this description does not begin to encompass the multiple types of om buds and the broad and diverse tasks they undertake
as federal state and local governments corporations businesses universities and nonprofit organizations began to use om buds with regularity in the variations in how they dealt with complaints emerged
for example some om buds investigate and issue formal reports or findings others offer informal interest based dispute resolution options and still others advocate for particular groups
these differences cause public confusion and spark heated debate in the profession over who is ombudsman
in response to the lack of uniformity and diverging roles of ombudsmen in the american bar association aba voluntary private professional association of lawyers adopted standards for the establishment and operation of om buds offices
the aba developed these standards with good intentions to advise and guide om buds on the structure and operation of their offices and to improve public confidence in the integrity of the om buds process
while many om buds are not attorneys historically the aba has been at the forefront of the om buds movement
om buds are highly effective in dispute resolution key component of the american legal system
om buds often resolve conflicts in their early stages which could otherwise develop into litigation or more substantial disputes
therefore om buds whether or not they are attorneys serve vital role by establishing process to handle complaints exploring underlying facts through informal inquiry or investigation and addressing those complaints in manner that best fits the situation
as result since the aba has urged the establishment of om buds offices in the governmental sector to investigate and critique administrative actions
more recently the aba has undertaken greater role in the om buds profession
by the aba had broadened its policies to support greater use of om buds in all areas including academia and the private sector and created the standards for the establishment and operation of om buds offices
the standards categorized the different types of ombudsmen and set forth the basic authorities and essential characteristics by which all om buds should operate
in the aba revised the standards to include new provisions that address important legal issues such as confidentiality notice and the scope of om buds authority
while the aba standards do not have the force of law courts often look to the aba for guidance on legal and ethical issues
accordingly the aba standards need to be clear and reflect industry practices for the various types of om buds
this article examines how the good intentions to define and legitimize the profession went astray
part of this article examines the evolution of the om buds profession from its origins to the present categorization by the aba into four distinct types and explores the need for standards that emphasize the fundamentally different orientations of om buds
part ii examines the common essential characteristics of om buds and explores the need for standards that describe how different kinds of om buds approach independence impartiality and confidentiality differently
by emphasizing these differences and creating separate standards for each om buds category the aba would add more clarity to profession plagued by public misunderstanding
additionally the aba standards should minimize confusion by om buds over important provisions affecting legal issues such as confidentiality notice and the scope of om buds authority
part iii of this article examines how these provisions cause confusion and explores the legal and functional implications for om buds
it also offers recommendations for revising the standards so that om buds can function with the strong protection of confidentiality provides clear provisions defining what constitutes notice of employee acts that may subject an entity to liability and describes the scope of authority to assist union employees
while the om buds profession is relatively new in north america by examining the standards hope to increase knowledge and clarity about the profession and reduce the number of quizzical and confused looks by individuals who ask
in addition this article speaks to practicing om buds who may feel threatened by the standards and their legal implications and offers recommendations to maintain the integrity of the profess ioni evolution of the om buds profess io na
origins of the classical model adjudicatory classical ombudsman is based on am odel originating in sweden
in swedish king charles xii appointed of to investigate the conduct of administrators who acted in his name
the chancellor would report his findings to the king and serve as an overseer of administrative actions
as sweden moved towards are presentative democracy parliament also wanted who would monitor investigate and report back to parliament not the king on the operation of the new government
in its constitution sweden instituted the position of the just it ie ombudsman justice ombudsman
elected by the legislature the justice ombudsman was to be person of known legal ability and outstanding integrity
the purpose of the ombudsman was to the legality of official and protect the public by complaints of official wrongdoing
if necessary the ombudsman would prosecute officials who acted unlawfully or failed to perform their duties properly
as the role of the justice ombudsman evolved he became more defender concerned with resolving public complaints against the public bureaucracy and less asa prosecutor of official wrongdoing
today sweden has four ombudsmen each specializing in different public fields
the concept of the ombudsman did not spread quickly
it took more than years before another country followed example and appointed an ombudsman
momentum for instituting ombudsmen began in when denmark appointed its first ombudsman
new zealand and norway followed in and and the om buds movement continued to spread around the world to guyana tanzania canada the united kingdom mauri ti us northern ireland israel fiji france zambia papua new guinea portugal australia austria trinidad and to bago jamaica the philippines ghana ireland the netherlands and spain
while the united states did not adopt federal ombudsman several states joined the om buds ranks starting with hawaii in followed by nebraska iowa new jersey alaska kansas and florida as well as several urban areas
some scholars refer to this surge from the mid to the and attribute it to governmental recognition of ability of ombudsmen to advance the cause of human rights to control the public bureaucracy to remedy individual grievances against public maladministration and to draw public attention to administrative maladies in public organizations
performing these duties classical ombudsmen took an adjudicatory approach by conducting investigations deposing witnesses subpoenaing evidence creating an official record and issuing findings judgments and formal public reports
the mission of the classical ombudsman reflects this approach the mission is to generate complaints against government administration touse its extensive powers of investigation in performing post decision administrative audit to form judgments which criticize or vindicate administrators and to report publicly its findings and recommendations but not to change administrative decisions
thus the classical ombudsman provides both procedural and substantive justice procedural justice by following standard procedures for conducting investigations and substantive justice by judging and reporting on the merits of complaint
origins of the organizational model an approach introduction of the organizational om buds model in the united states in the occurred during period of political and social turmoil as universities faced student protests against the war in vietnam and citizens demanded protections from the maladministration of corporate bureaucracies
within corporations and universities there was agr owing concern about employee complaints regarding managerial power abuse the complexities of managing and increasing diverse workforce recognition of the limitations of hierarchical management structures and similar issues
as result corporations and universities looked to om buds as away to manage internal grievances and conflicts
instead of copying the classical swedish om buds model most corporations and universities who appointed ombudsmen modified the role to meet specific needs within these institutions
corporations and universities were seeking an internal mechanism by which grievances and conflicts could be handled in an impartial manner by an independent person who would be seen as neutral with respect to the various factions interest groups and statuses within the organization
unlike the classical model which was born out of ane ed for independent investigation and prosecution of public complaints the corporate or organizational ombudsman originated from need for an alternative form of dispute resolution for employee and consumer complaints
the mission of the organizational ombudsman is to provide confidential neutral and informal process which facilitates fair and equitable resolutions to concerns that arise in the organization
in performing this mission the ombudsman serves as an information and communication resource upward feedback channel advisor dispute resolution expert and change agent
mary ro we ombudsman for the massachusetts institute of technology and cofounder of the corporate ombudsman association now the international ombudsman association further defined the role of the organizational ombudsman which highlights this approach an effective organizational om buds program typically would offer all informal interest based dispute resolution options listening coaching informal intervention into classic mediation facilitating generic approaches to problem support systems change training throughout the organization to prevent needless disputes safe access for people with serious concerns and confidential transmittal of information for those who need to the whistle
the concept of the multi door courthouse the organizational ombudsman refers visitors to the appropriate place inside the organization for addressing problem
in this sense not deliver due process they deliver whatever responsible process is appropriate for each individual circumstance
classical organizational and advocate om buds according to classical ombudsmen organizational ombudsmen have distorted the swedish model and are inappropriately using the title diluting the purity of the profession
while organizational ombudsmen were not the first to lay claim to the title they are now the most prevalent form of ombudsmen in the united states
in fact some classical ombudsmen have bitterly complained that organizational ombudsmen have the om buds movement
faced with the tension between classical and organizational om buds the aba sought to define and clarify their different roles
in the preamble to the standards the aba describes om buds as those who and questions from individuals concerning people within an entity or the functioning of an entity
they work for the resolution of particular issues and where appropriate make recommendations for the improvement of the general administration of the entities they serve
the definition of an ombudsman unified the profession such that it could apply to both classical and organizational models
to further define and distinguish between the various types of ombudsmen who have emerged in the field the aba created separate categories of ombudsmen
in its standards the aba identified three categories classical ombudsmen organizational ombudsmen and advocate ombudsmen
the aba defined classical om buds as public sector om buds who receives complaints from the general public or internally and addresses actions and failures to act of government agency official or public employee
this definition was based on the swedish model
in contrast the aba defined an organizational om buds as one who fair and equitable resolutions of concerns that arise within the entity
definition alludes to the approach of the organizational om buds
it may also be construed to limit the organizational jurisdiction by failing to address concerns arising outside the organization
traditionally organizational om buds have also handled concerns arising outside the entity for example those brought by customers consumers vendors or other public members who interact or are affected by the organization however these complaints brought by those outside the organization are not included in the definition of an organizational om buds
both classical and organizational ombudsmen objected to the addition of to their ranks
advocate ombudsmen looked radically different from other ombudsmen in that that they failed to adhere to one of the fundamental characteristics of om buds impartiality
unlike classical or organizational om buds advocate om buds serve as agents of individuals who may be unable or have difficulty finding resolution to their disputes and may need voice to advocate on their behalf
the first advocate om buds originated in response to abuse and neglect of nursing home residents in the late and early
in president nixon directed the health education and welfare department hew now the department of health and human services assist the states in establishing investigative om buds units which would respond responsible and constructive way to complaints made by or on behalf of individual nursing home patients
today these ombudsmen are the largest group of advocate ombudsmen in the united states
known as long term care ombudsmen they serve to promote the interests of institutionalized elderly to protect their health safety welfare and rights
while ombudsmen assist nursing home residents by coaching them to develop specific strategies to use to address their problems directly ombudsmen also advocate directly on behalf of the individual resident
there may be times when resident wants the ombudsman to speak on his or her behalf or needs the support of the ombudsman in pursuing resolution
this usually occurs when resources within the home or community are unknown when family or legal problems arise or when there is fear of causing tension in resident staff relationships
there are also cases where an ombudsman may represent ares ident who is unable to communicate his her wishes and has no one else to uphold his or her rights
not only do ombudsmen assist residents in asserting their rights and expressing their grievances within the long term care facility they advocate for residents outside the facility by seeing administrative legal or other remedies to protect their health safety welfare and rights
these functions are contrary to both the classical and organizational models which prevent om buds from suing on behalf of complainant or advocating on behalf of an individual
classical om buds further differentiated and legislative om buds in the aba further differentiated among types of ombudsmen
in order to distinguish between ombudsmen who are appointed by the legislature and ombudsmen who are appointed by governmental executive or public official the aba broke up the category into and om buds
for example national human rights ombudsman may be established by the legislative or executive branch
in africa human rights ombudsmen are typically based on the executive om buds model
those who support the executive model argue that these ombudsmen are effective because they have more credibility and command great respect due to their proximity to the head of state their personal disposition and integrity
conversely executive ombudsmen may have to investigate critique or challenge those who appointed them and therefore may not feel comfortable exercising their duty freely
because legislative om buds are appointed by legislative body they have more autonomy and statutory protections to ensure their integrity will not be compromised
executive om buds may also be located within the private sector and may be appointed by private executive
whether located within the public or private sector executive om buds to hold the entity or specific programs accountable or work with officials to improve the performance of program
example an executive om buds office may function as private nonprofit corporation that serves to assist citizens in resolving complaints against agencies of county government
news ombudsman may also be considered an executive om buds
appointed by the executive editor publisher or president news ombudsman receives and investigates complaints from newspaper readers or listeners or viewers of radio and television stations about accuracy fairness balance and good taste in news coverage
he or she recommends appropriate remedies or responses to correct or clarify news reports
many newspapers have dedicated column for their news ombudsmen to publish their recommendations or the results of their informal investigations so the public is informed
in this capacity news ombudsman holds the media accountable and improves the quality of journalism
the different approaches identified but not clarified while the aba standards identify separate om buds categories to distinguish their roles the standards add confusion by recommending that the enabling om buds legislation or written om buds charter should authorize om buds to investigate and report findings facilitate negotiate mediate and make recommendations for the resolution of individual complaints
some of these functions are contrary to the classical and organizational models yet are described as part of the role of all ombudsmen
the only om buds function the aba points out as not applying to all ombudsmen is the ability on behalf of affected individuals or groups
this function is reserved for advocate om buds and applies only when authorized by the charter
aba standards should be revised so that all functions not just that of advocacy are specifically authorized by the enabling legislation written charter or internal regulation
in addition the scope of the organizational om buds should be expanded to include concerns that come from outside the organization
finally the standards should make clear that not all legislation charters or regulations should authorize om buds to perform the same functions especially functions that are contrary to the orientations of the different ombudsmen
these different orientations of adjudication and permeate all aspects of certain om buds operations
in addition to establishing categories of ombudsmen the aba identified essential characteristics common to all ombudsmen including independence impartiality and confidentiality
however by focusing on these commonalities real differences in the ways ombudsmen function in accordance with the essential characteristics of the om buds office are over shado we da independence the standards require that ombudsmen be independent in their structure function and appearance
for some om buds this is more difficult task than for others
structurally legislative ombudsmen have the most independence because their independence is guaranteed by law
while legislative om buds are appointed by the legislature and are part of the legislative branch they are guaranteed independence by the enabling constitution or statute
this ensures that they are from interference in the legitimate performance of duties and independent from control limitation or penalty imposed for retaliatory purposes by an official of the appointing entity or by person who may be the subject of complaint or inquiry
in addition legislative om buds are typically assured ate rm of service with high salary equivalent to that high officer and may be removed only for cause which enhances their structural independence
legislative om buds need independence to have the freedom to investigate and perform their duties without fear of retaliation or control by other entities or individuals
for legislative om buds the resolution outlining essential characteristics for maintaining independence still serves as model for federal state and local governments who want to create such an office
in addition to the previous structural characteristics the following functional characteristics ensure authority of the ombudsman to criticize all agencies officials and public employees
freedom of the ombudsman to employ his own assistants and to delegate them
freedom of the ombudsman to investigate any act or failure to act by any agency official or public access of the ombudsman to all public records
authority to inquire into fairness correctness of findings motivation adequacy of reasons efficiency and procedural propriety of any action or inaction by any agency official or public discretionary power to determine what complaints to investigate and to determine which criticisms to make or to opportunity for any agency official or public employee criticized by the ombudsman to have advance notice of the criticism and to publish with the criticism an answering statement executive om buds do not have similarly strong statutory guarantee of independence
executive om buds are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of governmental or private executives
as these executives change the om buds office may receive more or less support or may even be phased out
despite these limitations governmental and private executives can provide the om buds office with independence and with the same characteristics previously endorsed by the aba for legislative om buds
because executive om buds follow classical om buds model which focuses on investigation and reporting the results of these investigations the legitimacy of this work is jeopardized when the om buds office is not independent from the chief executive
though executive and legislative om buds are independent paradoxically their very connection to their chief executives and legislative creators may account for their effectiveness
an executive ombudsman encounters an obstinate or inefficient agency he may call on his chief for support
when classical ombudsman meets similar situation he may call upon the legislature through special or annual report or upon the press to impose similar pressure
for example the executive ombudsman of the city of portland described how his connection to the mayor helped him obtain information and documents from public employees who usually provide them under the assumption that the om buds office is to the mayor rather than an independent body
in contrast legislative om buds have independent subpoena power and do not need to rely on the perceived power brought by the executive or wait for the mayor to grant such subpoena power as provided by city charter
while the close association with the executive may be helpful in fulfilling the om buds investigative role it also may confuse public employees over the role of the ombudsman as an independent office
independence is necessary to prevent om buds from being influenced or controlled by executives with political motives
for example while running for reelection in marion barry created the position of ethics ombudsman in response to public concern over alleged corruption in city government
in addition to hearing complaints from city government employees and the public the ethics ombudsman had authority to report findings of wrongdoing to the public or to law enforcement officials as well as to the mayor the inspector general and city agency heads
while exposing corruption was the stated objective of the ethics ombudsman it is questionable whether barry truly wanted corruption to be revealed in light of his own political agenda
shortly after the election the ethics ombudsman position faded away and is now defunct
without independence an executive om buds may feel pressure to provide aflat ter ing report of governmental activities or modify the results of their investigations to suit the political aspirations of the executive
advocate om buds are often appointed by governmental executive
however the location of the advocate om buds office may pose conflicts of interest
for example in some states long term care ombudsmen are appointed by the governor whereas in others they are appointed by director of an agency where the om buds office is located
like other ombudsmen advocate om buds need to be insulated from political interference agency pressure or retaliation
independence allows om buds to it like it without the same fear that other internal agency staff may have
for example advocate om buds must have the freedom to gather sufficient information about the problem to advocate on behalf of the individuals they serve
moreover in advocating for individuals of particular population advocate om buds may be criticizing or arguing against the very agency in which they are housed
as result special care needs to be given to ensure independence so that om buds have the freedom to serve as strong voice for the people they represent
organizational om buds also require independence but for different purpose
unlike legislative and executive om buds the primary purpose of organizational om buds offices is not to conduct investigations or issue public reports
in fact investigations are specifically prohibited
organizational om buds need to remain independent from all other line and staff structures so that visitors will utilize the office and seek out the om buds as an alternative to the other channels within the organization
if an organizational om buds is viewed as part of the management structure or an extension of the employees may not come forward for fear that the om buds will be biased or will breach confidentiality
furthermore organizational om buds provide variety of services for visitors offering flexible process that varies according to the needs of the visitor
accordingly organizational om buds need to operate without interference from other entities or individuals within the organization and should not be penalized for inquiring about particular issue or problem
like executive om buds organizational om buds do not have independence guaranteed by statute
instead the governing policy of the institution provides the organizational om buds with independence
for example organizational om buds report only to the highest officers in an organization such as the
if there are too many people between the om buds department and the to whom the om buds reports employees will recognize that the om buds could potentially be influenced by or beholden to these individuals
in addition to reporting only to the highest level within an organization and remaining outside the line management structure organizational om buds can be assured independence by policies that provide for renewable term limits removal clauses for cause only high salary access to information within the organization an adequate budget that cannot be reduced for retaliatory purposes and access to independent counsel
in this way organizational om buds can maintain independence serving as the
of these safeguards argue that without statutory protections om buds cannot be assured independence because they are part of the organization they serve
because organizational om buds typically report to the or board of directors they may potentially seek to please these individuals or act in away to maintain their positions as om buds
the aba uses the following criteria to determine whether an om buds is independent whether anyone subject to the or anyone directly responsible for apers on under the jurisdiction can control or limit the performance of assigned duties or can for retaliatory purposes eliminate the office remove the om buds or reduce the budget or resources of the office
while organizations may have internal policies prohibiting this type of control or retaliation om buds can still suffer reprisal by president or who can find ways to eliminate remove or reduce the om buds office
organizational om buds can never attain the same structural independence as legislative om buds whose independence is guaranteed by law and protected by the legislative branch
instead organizational om buds are only independent to the extent the entity allows
these differences in independence are important and need to be explained in the aba standards so that the public is aware of the limits of independence within these cate go rie sb impartiality in conducting inquiries and investigations the aba requires that om buds demonstrate impartiality only when conducting inquiries and investigations
the aba limited impartiality in response to the needs of om buds who advocate on behalf of particular population and for om buds who issue public reports findings or recommendations that advocate change in law policy or decisions
these actions are contrary to the practice of organizational ombudsmen who strive for impartiality in all aspects of their work
as in facilitative mediation visitors to the om buds office should not expect to be given advice
for an ombudsperson giving advice may be of condescending partisanship condescending because it assumes the inability of the advisee to come to her his own decision about the best course of action and partisanship because it means we have been me what to is merely the most flattering version of on my side
if an ombudsperson gives advice then the ombudsperson has stake in the outcome
instead organizational om buds work with visitors to identify and evaluate range of options
the visitors not the om buds decide how to proceed with their complaints and which options are best suited to resolve their disputes
if people perceive they have some control over the complaint process they cope better with tough problems and are more likely to feel the process is fair
in addition organizational om buds recognize that there may be several ways to resolve dispute and that the optimal solution for the visitor is the one freely chosen
recognizing the importance of self determination in conflict organizational om buds do not provide advice and remain impartial
unlike other types of om buds organizational om buds do not conduct investigations or issue reports findings or recommendations stemming from these investigations
engaging in such activities would jeopardize their reputations as impartial conflict resolution resources
organizational om buds do conduct informal inquiries at the request of visitor to obtain more information about conflict and explore options for resolution
however these inquires sometimes referred to as informal investigations are not conducted to generate any reports findings or recommendations by the om buds for how the dispute should be resolved
one organizational om buds described this practice of informal investigation as the last word on an issue but as catalyst for the parties to attend to the matter anew and fro ma different vantage point
another described the purpose of informal investigations as the dynamics of dispute
meeting with visitors organizational om buds acquire wealth of information about the types of conflicts and problems that arise
although visits to the om buds are confidential organizational om buds may provide upward feedback to management that identifies general trends and patterns in complaints brought to the om buds office without revealing confidential information or disclosing the identity of the visitors
for example organizational om buds may record the demographics of those who visit the office eg gender race ethnicity the general position held at the organization eg supervisor administrative staff or other employee classification specific to the organization and the type of issues raised by visitors eg policy benefits discipline ethics discrimination personnel management work environment
these categories are general enough that an individual visitor would not be able to be identified yet the organization has access to information that identifies problem areas
in addition the organizational om buds may learn of particular problem such as failure to enforce policy on the basis of single case and may provide feedback to management while maintaining the confidentiality of the visitor
this upward feedback allows management to take proactive measures to find solutions to problems that otherwise may go unidentified and leads to systematic change within the organization
in addition to identifying trends and patterns in complaints organizational om buds may provide general recommendations for systematic change
for example in its annual report the office of the ombudsman center for cooperative resolution recommended that the national institutes for strengthen formal and informal systems for addressing complaints and conflicts and ensure that those with grievances and complaints work within those systems
review the current approach to employee performance evaluation
evaluate supervisors on their management responsibilities and provide effective ongoing training for managers
reconsider the structure of stage one of the agency grievance process
develop new approaches to addressing racial and other identity issues at
shift the focus at away from an exclusive concentration on problems and failures
these recommendations do not advocate specific solutions but are important starting points to explore options for systematic change within the organization
in performing this function organizational om buds have been deemed agents
providing recommendations for change organizational om buds need to walk fine line
often organizational om buds are asked to serve on and advise committees responsible for drafting new policies and procedures that were formed as result of the very problems identified by the ombudsman
while om buds want to assist in correcting these problems it is important that they not serve in decision making capacity draft new policies or advocate particular result
om buds may have to meet with employees in the future who have problems or complaints with these policies
if om buds are invested in forming or endorsing particular policies they may feel compelled to defend them thereby compromising their neutrality
in addition if the om buds serves on these committees with others in the management structure it may give the appearance that the om buds is simply an arm of management
in order to assist the organization in forming new policies while maintaining impartiality some ombudsmen serve on committees in an officio or or as reader
by maintaining distance from management and by refusing to endorse particular policies these om buds adhere to their duty to serve in an impartial manner
in this capacity om buds should be aware of the between helping to identify possible problems in proposed policies and procedures and promoting particular policies or procedures
legislative executive and advocate om buds this distinction does not exist
as part of their practice these om buds not only promote particular policies and procedures but they may do so publicly
in addition they may take position about the merits complaint or the outcome of an investigation
for these om buds impartiality extends to their conduct during their investigation and the evaluation of claim but does not prohibit them from ultimately opining on who is right or wrong
the fact that impartiality extends only to inquiries or investigations does not mean that it is any less important for legislative executive or advocate om buds
if an om buds is not impartial complainants may not seek the assistance and any criticism or recommendation made by the om buds will not be viewed as credible
the aba standards should reflect the difference in impartiality between organizational om buds and others
for organizational om buds impartiality extends to all aspects of their work not simply to informal inquiries or investigations
the aba should emphasize this difference so that the public has acle ar understanding of how various om buds confidentiality the aba recognizes confidentiality as an essential characteristic of all om buds offices
under the aba standards om buds does not disclose and is not required to disclose any information provided in confidence except to address an imminent risk of serious harm
in addition all pertaining to complaint inquiry or investigation are confidential
under the aba standards an om buds disclose confidential information so long as doing so does not reveal its source
in essence the aba standards guarantee anonymity not confidentiality
if the om buds believes that disclosure of confidential information is needed the om buds may disclose this information without obtaining consent from the source as long as the identity is not compromised
unless the sources requests that his her identity be revealed the om buds will protect it from disclosure
for organizational om buds the protection of confidentiality is much broader
under the code of ethics for organizational om buds the ombudsman all communications with those seeking assistance in strict confidence and does not disclose confidential communications unless given permission to do so
therefore all information divulged by visitor is confidential and the information cannot be revealed unless the visitor gives express consent
this gives visitors feeling of control over their conflicts
yet the aba standards appear to take this control away when an om buds communicates with representatives of the entity about allegations by multiple complainants that may reflect inappropriate or wrongful behavior or conduct the complainants are only advised after the fact if the om buds communicated confidential information to the entity
as long as the identity of the complainant is not revealed confidential information may be shared
ultimately the choice to disclose confidential information belongs to the om buds
complainant cannot demand that the om buds disclose such information or direct the om buds actions
confidentiality is the heart of the organizational om buds practice
without confidentiality individuals would not feel safe coming forward to express their conflicts problems or concerns
the protection of confidentiality is unique feature that other traditional channels within the organization such as management human resources audit security legal and compliance do not provide
the om buds office does not replace these channels rather it offers an alternative that enables employees to communicate their grievances by providing them with confidential forum
indeed the organizational om buds would add little value if same information could have flowed through traditional channels
individuals fear using formal grievance channels which often ill suited to providing prompt efficient and just solutions to the problems that are brought to them
approximately percent of the complaints within an organization become formal grievances
the other percent come from employees who feel mistreated and will it to bring complaint because they believe they will not receive their desired outcome or avoiding by withdrawing from the relationship
fearing that their dispute will be disclosed individuals fail to take action to resolve the conflict
fears may arise from many sources loss of privacy and jeopardizing the covert andor overt being thought of as disloyal lacking in humor or being seen as not having enough evidence without confidentiality employees may also fear losing control over their conflict
they need the ability to speak freely with an om buds about their conflict without fear that action will be taken without their consent
in addition employees also worry about response to their complaints
individuals may not report misconduct because they do not believe employers will take action to stop the misconduct or resolve the conflict
conversely other individuals fail to report misconduct because they believe the employer will impose exceedingly harsh measures on the perpetrator
organizational om buds may help fearful employees think through which options best suit their individual needs and conflict styles
unlike public citizens who bring complaints to al egis lative or executive om buds employees of an organization who bring complaints are particularly vulnerable
in an organization like ac om pa ny or university can be terminated in ways that participation in country cannot even rights as citizen can be drastically restricted
threat of retaliation warrants strict confidentiality by the organizational om buds office
as result an organizational om buds must be very careful not to discuss case in way that may compromise the identity of the complainant and must promote strict measures to ensure confidentiality
not only should organizational om buds not use the names of visitors they should not reveal information that could lead to identification of visitor without that express permission
in addition the organizational om buds office does not keep case records for the organization and should have ac on sistent and standard practice for destroying any notes from case
all data prepared for the organization should be carefully scrutinized to protect the identity of the visitor
in order for employees to use the organizational om buds office and discuss their problems and complaints openly and honestly they need assurance that they are communicating in safe space and that the organizational om buds will keep their communications confidential unless given express consent to disclose
for organizational om buds confidentiality is central to their practice and is necessary in all communications with visitors
however for legislative and executive om buds confidentiality is tool that is offered at the discretion in order elicit needed information or protect the source of needed information
confidentiality does not extend to all communications but is provided on case by case basis when needed
for these classical om buds the aba standards do not pose problem because even confidential information may be revealed as long as the source is protected
disclosing confidential information will not likely lead to disclosure of the source where the om buds receives numerous complaints from the public
due to the critical role that confidentiality plays in the organizational om buds practice the aba should revise its standards so that this protection does not merely guarantee anonymity
the standards should go farther by providing that confidential information not be disclosed unless the source provides express consent and the om buds agrees to disclose this information
such provision would correct the inconsistencies in the aba standards that send two different messages one protecting only the source not the confidential information from disclosure and the other protecting all confidential information from disclosure unless the source consents to reveal it
the inconsistencies in the confidentiality provisions of the aba standards may be explained by the need of organizational om buds to provide upward feedback to the organization
as part of their practice organizational om buds may provide an organization with trending data
this information may be used by the organization to promote systematic change
as ares ult organizational om buds must be able to reveal information without the consent
however the information that the om buds reveals is not confidential
this information may include the general demographics of visitors to the om buds office the type of issue addressed the work relationship between complainants and respondents the processes used by the om buds office to assist visitors the time it took to resolve disputes and the techniques used for resolving cases
the aba standards do not adequately address this upward feedback function in its discussion of the limits of confidentiality
while the standards recommend that the om buds any exceptions to the maintaining confidentiality with the source of the information the standards should explicitly refer to the upward feedback function of om buds
clarity is needed for visitors who may be confused as to the limits of confidentiality and what information om buds retain and distribute as part of this function
if the standards are not revised to take into account upward feedback the standards may be construed to prohibit this function since information the person provides in cannot be disclosed unless the source provides consent
such an interpretation would obliterate one of the essential roles of an organizational om buds to promote change within the organization
legal and functional implications of the aba standards on om buds me na
confidentiality missed opportunity the aba passed on an opportunity to strengthen the confidentiality of the om buds office
the seminal case finding an om buds privilege roy united technologies corporation and its progeny provide legal basis for protecting the confidential communications of organizational ombudsmen
the aba however declined to incorporate this privilege into its standards
roy is the first case to protect communications of an organizational om buds from disclosure under af ed eral common law privilege
although un pub lish ed this case has become the most influential and is frequently cited by other courts
in this case mon or anjan roy united technologies ut ce mp loy ee visited the om buds office
he later filed suit against for discrimination on the basis of age race and national origin
when he sought to depose the ombudsman the om buds filed amotion for protective order to prevent disclosure of confidential information
the court granted the protective order
in his ruling judge ca bran es looked to federal rule of evidence which provides that privilege of witness shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the united states in light of reason and experience
this rule provides little specific guidance it provides judges with flexibility to develop privilege rules on case by case basis
the court granted the protective order
in his analysis judge ca bran es found that the ombudsman relationship must exhibit four factors to support finding of common law privilege
known as the wig more test these factors include the communication must be one made in the belief that it will not be disclosed confidentiality must be essential to the maintenance of the relationship between the parties the relationship should be one that society considers worthy of being fostered the injury to the relationship incurred by the disclosure must be greater than the benefit gained in the correct disposal of the litigation
the ombudsman satisfied all four factors
first there was an expectation that communications with the om buds office would be kept confidential
this was demonstrated by the precautions as having an number to prevent tracing that were taken to ensure confidentiality
second confidentiality is essential to the relationship and is ade fining characteristic of an om buds office
in fac tu tc established the om buds office for the purpose of ensuring confidentiality and promoting candor
third the om buds office benefits society by promoting accountability among contractors encouraging individuals to report waste and fraud and enabling many disputes to be resolved informally
finally the om buds strong interest in confidentiality is outweighed by the minimal interest in discovery
because the privilege belonged to the om buds office and the plaintiff could not waive it the ombudsman could not be deposed about the confidential communications regarding the case
relying on roy the court in mc donne ll douglas corporation also recognized an om buds privilege and prevented discovery of communications made with the om buds office
in the plaintiff wished to depose employees about communications with the mc donne ll douglas om buds office to prove discriminatory intent and to prove that the om buds participated in the final decision to terminate her as part of the for appealing dismissal
applying the wig more test the court found the ombudsman satisfied all four factors
communications made to the om buds were made under the belief that they would not be disclosed
this policy of confidentiality was supported by the structure of the om buds office as an independent and neutral entity by the adherence to code of ethics providing for confidentiality and by the strict pledge and advice to employees that communications were confidential
in addition the court found that confidentiality was essential to the relationships between employees and the om buds office
without this confidentiality the office would be just one more nonconfidential opportunity for employees to air disputes
office provides an opportunity for complete disclosure without the specter of retaliation that does not exist in the other available nonconfidential grievance and complaint procedures
the om buds office also serves an important role in society by providing employees who work for federal government contractors in the aircraft space and other industries
with an opportunity to make confidential statements and to receive confidential guidance information and aid to remedy workplace problems to benefit themselves and possibly the nation
moreover society benefits from the om buds office which promotes informal dispute resolution and settlement based on confidential communications
in the years following several jurisdictions continued to uphold privilege for the om buds office
in case surprising on its face mc donne ll douglas the very corporation that obtained an om buds privilege in was denied this same protection six years later
in carman mc donn el douglas corporation the eighth circuit failed to provide privilege for confidential communications made by an employee to the company ombudsman who investigated and mediated workplace disputes
however closer look at the procedural and substantive history of the case reveals that mc donn el douglas forced the by failing to submit evidence to the lower court of the value of its om buds office
consequently the appellate court may not have factual basis in the record to extend the privilege
in carman mc donne ll douglas fired frank carman as part of reduction in force
carman later sued alleging his termination violated the age discrimination in employment act the missouri human rights act and the employee retirement income security act of during discovery carman requested all the notes and documents concerning the plaintiff and number of other individuals
the request covered various topics including meeting notes regarding layoffs and meeting notes about carman
in failing to extend the om buds privilege the carman court did not utilize the four part wig more test
instead the court examined whether the party seeking the creation of new evidentiary privilege overcame significant burden of establishing refusal to testify or excluding relevant evidence has public good transcending the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining the truth
the court recognized the public good that the om buds office fosters in encouraging and efficient alternative dispute resolution techniques
however this was not enough mc donne ll douglas has failed to present any evidence and indeed has not even argued that the ombudsman method is more successful at resolving workplace disputes than other forms of alternative dispute resolution nor has it even pointed to any evidence establishing that its own ombudsman is especially successful at resolving workplace disputes prior to the commencement of litigation
in other words general claims of the benefits of alternative dispute resolution were insufficient to secure privilege for the om buds office
instead specific proof of the success of the office in promoting alternative dispute resolution needed to be offered
while the court recognized the om buds office received communications in six years the carman court found that this statistic did not provide any context to evaluate its significance
in addition the carman court was not persuaded that the benefits provided by the om buds office would be lost without the privilege
according to the an aggrieved employee or an employee witness is deciding whether or not to confide in ac om pa ny ombudsman his greatest concern is not likely to be that the statement will someday be revealed in civil discovery
the court found that even without the privilege employees would utilize the om buds office since the om buds could still keep confidential communications from management
on the face of the opinions it seems surprising that two courts could come to such drastically different conclusions about the importance of the mc donne ll douglas om buds office
however charles howard the attorney who represented the ombudsman in the seminal roy case offers some insight into the decision in carman
mc donne ll douglas first objected to request for production of documents by simply stating as an were considered confidential and any information and documents relating to her activities are immune from discovery
the lower court overruled this objection but later reconsidered when mc donne ll douglas submitted two unreported orders from the same district court recognizing privilege for the mc donne ll douglas om buds office
mately the district court ruled that mc donne ll douglas did not have to produce om buds documents but failed to provide any analysis on the issue
mc donne ll douglas had not presented any factual basis to the trial court to prove its entitlement to the privilege the appeals court had virtually no choice but to deny the privilege
this posthoc rationalization for the carman decision is appealing nevertheless ombudsmen must still face the precedent carman left behind that weakens claim to privilege
indeed while most courts considering the om buds privilege have extended it carman is the highest court to have ruled on this issue
since carman two other courts denied extending ap riv ile ge to om buds communications
these cases demonstrate the weakness of the protection of confidentiality offered by organizational ombudsmen
in light of the conflicting case law it is important that the aba provide guidance and endorse confidentiality privilege as established in roy and its progeny
unfortunately the aba standards do not take this approach
the aba standards impose only limited rights of confidentiality and do not mention the legal requirements needed to create confidentiality privilege
first the legal requirement that the communication made in the belief that it will not is not strongly supported by the aba standards
while communications with the om buds office are confidential under the aba standards an om buds may disclose confidential information as long as the source is not revealed
if visitor is aware of this limitation on confidentiality then communications may not be made under the belief that they will be kept confidential
in order to ensure that communications are made under the belief of confidentiality the standards should allow an om buds to disclose confidential information only with the
the standards should also encourage practices that will support privilege including ac ode of ethics that obligates an om buds to maintain strict confidentiality use of numbers to prevent the tracing of calls policy for the destruction of records access to independent counsel policy against testifying in any proceeding and process for compiling aggregate statistics regarding the effectiveness of the om buds office
second the standards should include provision that confidentiality is essential to the relationship between organizational om buds and visitors
survey by the ethics resource center reveals that of all nonmanagement employees do not report the misconduct they observe
top reason given for failure to report misconduct was fear that the report will not be kept confidential
only by having confidential forum will employees feel safe communicating with the om buds office
the aba standards should also endorse the om buds relationship as that society considers worthy of being fostered
in this time of corporate scandals the om buds office functions as an early warning device of corporate malfeasance
for example om buds may provide data on the number of visitors who complained of unethical accounting matters which may show trend in these types of complaints
in addition to this upward feedback om buds may provide visitors with information about laws or policies requiring employees to report such misconduct information about the proper procedures to follow when reporting such misconduct and information about anti retaliation policies to encourage disclosure
if the visitor agrees the om buds may also assist by reporting the misconduct on the
in this capacity an om buds may increase the amount of reporting of corporate malfeasance in spite of the confidential nature
congress recognized the importance of confidentiality in the us sentencing guidelines which require that an organization take steps
to have and publicize system which may include mechanisms that allow for anonymity and confidentiality whereby the employees and agents may report or seek guidance regarding potential or actual conduct without fear of retaliation
in addition the sar banes ox ley act of requires the audit committees of the boards of directors of publicly held companies establish procedures for anonymous submissions by employees of the company of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters
exposure of corporate corruption would prevent huge losses sustained by the public shareholders and employees and om buds can serve vital role facilitating such exposure
organizational om buds also work to resolve disputes informally thus decreasing the amount of resources spent by the judiciary and organizations on employment litigation
resolving disputes informally with the assistance of an organizational om buds saves on costly fees reduces turnover increases retention of valuable employees increases employee productivity and decreases management time spent on workplace disputes
by endorsing these societal benefits and supporting common law privilege the aba standards could be used by om buds to counter courts like carman that question the value of om buds offices and undermine om buds befuddled notice if an employer has knowledge of wrongful conduct by its employees it may be subject to liability
for example notice to the employer of aho stile work environment is critical to determining employer liability
individuals often disclose complaints of sexual harassment or discrimination to the om buds
if an employer has knowledge or notice of these complaints then it may be subject to liability for the conduct
as result the aba standards need to provide clear guidance on what constitutes notice to the entity the om buds serves
the standard for determining employer liability depends on whether the hostile work environment was created by coworker or supervisor
an employer is subject to liability for hostile environment harassment created by coworker if the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action
thus an employer may have actual knowledge of the harassment or constructive notice of the harassment where the harassment was so severe and pervasive that management should have known of its existence
as for supervisors employer is subject to vicarious liability to victimized employee for actionable hostile environment created by supervisor with immediate or successively higher authority over the employee
should an employee succeed in making such claim the employer has the following affirmative defense and must prove by preponderance of the evidence that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior and that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or otherwise avoid harm
thus notice to the employer is important in establishing an affirmative defense to prove it took reasonable preventive and corrective action and that the plaintiff may have been unreasonable in not taking advantage of opportunities after being subjected to harassing behavior
when an individual complains about harassment to the om buds office this communication does not put the organization on notice
simply because the om buds is employed by the organization does not mean the om buds is capable of receiving notice
an organization can be put on notice only through one of its agents
agency is determined by the following factors the manifestations by the principal that the agent shall act for him the acceptance of the undertaking the understanding of the parties that the principal is to be in control of the undertaking
under these factors om buds cannot be considered agents of their employer because of the independence of the office
om buds do not act on behalf of any person or entity nor does any person or entity control their actions
upholding this notion the aba standards expressly prohibit the om buds from being deemed an agent of any person or entity other than the office of the om buds
while direct communications with the om buds office does not put the employer on notice an individual may request that the om buds discuss her case with management and disclose her identity
under the aba standards if the om buds communicates with representatives of the entity and reveals the facts of allegation and the identity of the then this communication is considered to provide notice to the entity
this notice provision is consistent with case law that allows for someone other than the complainant to provide notice to the employer
in addition to actual notice employers may receive constructive notice of the hostile work environment
under the aba standards if an om buds with representatives of the entity concerning an allegation of violation then
communication that reveals the facts of
allegations by multiple complainants that may reflect related behavior or conduct that is either inappropriate or wrongful should be regarded as providing notice to the entity of the alleged violation
not only is this lan gu age convoluted it fails to recognize the legal standard used to establish constructive notice
in order to have constructive notice of hostile work environment the harassment must be so severe and pervasive that the employer should have known of its existence
in evaluating whether multiple instances are so pervasive that the employer is put on notice courts consider when the past incidents of harassment occurred
if the harassment occurs intermittently over long period of time multiple incidents are insufficient to put an employer on notice
in addition to failing to require pervasive harassment the aba notice provision raises number of questions
first why should an om buds be required to speak with of the ie more than one representative concerning an allegation of violation before an employer may be put on notice
there is no legal precedent to support such are quire ment
in addition why not use language such as instead of to comport with legal precedent
second must the communication reveal the identity of the alleged perpetrator of the harassment
while an om buds may inform an employer of multiple complaints of related conduct or behavior without disclosing the identities of the complainants the aba standards do not specify whether the identity of the alleged perpetrator must be disclosed to constitute notice
some courts have found anonymous complaints that fail to disclose the identity of the alleged perpetrator as insufficient to constitute notice
while the report accompanying the aba standards states that the information provided in the complaints should sufficiently detailed that the entity could conduct its own investigation with respect to the allegations it is unclear what details are required
without clarity on what constitutes notice employers may restrict the om buds from communicating anonymous complaints of harassment or trends in the workplace environment to management for fear that they will be put on notice
because the aba standards are used to guide om buds offices more clarity is needed so that organizations know when they have been put on notice
at the very least the aba standards should require that allegations by multiple complainants identify the alleged perpetrator of related inappropriate or wrongful behavior or conduct
if the alleged perpetrator is not identified by multiple complainants the aba standard should reflect the legal standard requiring that the inappropriate or wrongful behavior or conduct be so pervasive or widespread that the organization should have known of its existence
once an employer is on notice of coworker harassment it is subject to liability if it fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action
likewise an employer is subject to liability for hostile work environment created by supervisor with immediate or successively higher authority over the victimized employee unless it can bring an affirmative defense
as part of the affirmative defense the employer must show that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct the harassment
in order to correct the harassing behavior the employer must have notice of its existence
without notice of the harassing behavior an employer exercising reasonable care cannot act promptly to correct the harassment
in addition an employer must show that the employee failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or otherwise avoid harm
thus an employer may avoid liability where an employee failed to report or delayed reporting the harassment
while failure to report is to per behavior courts vary as to how longan employee can delay reporting harassment before such delay is considered unreasonable
employees who first use an om buds to resolve their complaints informally may be considered to be unreasonable in their decision to delay their reports of harassment to the employer
an employee who reports to the wrong party may also be considered unreasonable in failing to take advantage of the policies and procedures
likewise because an om buds is expressly not an agent for the receipt of notice an employee who reports to an om buds to put an employer on notice may likewise be considered unreasonable
because notice impacts the right to recovery the aba requires that an om buds provide warnings to individuals who contact the om buds office for help or advice
specifically the om buds should inform visitors th ata the om buds will not voluntarily disclose to anyone outside the om buds office including the entity in which the om buds acts any information the person provides in confidence or the identity unless necessary to address an imminent risk of serious harm or with the express cons en tb important rights may be affected by when formal action is initiated and by and when the entity is informed of the allegedly inappropriate or wrongful behavior or cond uc tc communications to the om buds may not constitute notice to the entity unless the om buds communicates with representatives of the entity as described in the paragraph about which communications constitute noticed working with the om buds may address the problem or concern effectively but may not protect the rights of either the person contacting the office or the entity in which the om buds operate se the om buds is not and is not substitute lawyer representative or counselor the person may wish to consult lawyer or other appropriate resource with respect to those rights while these warnings may be appropriate for some visitors they may be completely inapplicable to others
for example some visitors contact om buds to obtain more information about particular policy or benefit and may simply be referred to another office
if an om buds begins every conversation with series of warnings instead of first listening to the concerns of an upset visitor the om buds may be seen as unhelpful or callous and maybe jeopardizing the relationship with the visitor
providing these warnings in brochures om buds policies and publicity and providing om buds the flexibility to determine how and when to give visitors verbal warnings about notice are consistent with the informality of the om buds process
finally the notice provisions invite discovery into the communications made with the om buds office
the very question of whether communication constitutes notice depends on the communications the om buds had with the organization
because the om buds is simply passing on information from the visitor any communications made by the visitor may also be subject to scrutiny
to serve as provider of alternative dispute resolution services an organizational om buds needs to be able to communicate with both visitors and all other employees including managers in confidence
accordingly the provisions should promote the confidentiality of these communication sc limits of authority under the aba standards the scope of authority is severely curtailed by preventing om buds from assisting union employees an area where they could be of vital assistance
when the aba revised the standards it prohibited any om buds any issue arising under collective bargaining agreement or which falls within the purview of any federal state or local labor or employment law rule or regulation unless there is no collective bargaining representative and the employer specifically authorizes the om buds to do so
first many of the disputes employees bring to the om buds office implicate labor or employment laws rules or regulations
barring om buds from handling such matters would create long line of visitors who would be turned away
second even when an issue is covered by collective bargaining agreement an om buds may still be helpful in resolving dispute
while om buds should defer to the union process formatters covered under the collective bargaining agreement this does not mean that om buds should be excluded from assisting with such issues where union representatives management and union members agree to use the om buds office for informal resolution
as long as om buds assistance does not amount to an unfair labor practice under the national labor relations act or is not barred by the collective bargaining agreement the aba should recommend that om buds assist in this area
many om buds comment on their effectiveness in resolving disputes with union employees
in the federal government setting the om buds and union may attempt to resolve matter jointly
as an alternative to formal grievance procedures an om buds can resolve disputes early on and may decrease retaliation brought by formal grievance
in addition the om buds may assist in facilitating resolution of dispute by providing access to the message to management in al ess challenging and providing information about hard management will fight on an issue
the om buds may also serve as vital link between different offices involved in the dispute resolution process including the union and labor relations
in the university setting faculty union employee may even request that an om buds assist in addressing sexual harassment complaints when faculty members are unwilling to use the formal complaint procedures
likewise corporate om buds have offered their assistance to both union employees and nonunion employees alike
accordingly the benefits om buds provide to employers with collective bargaining units should not be curtailed by the aba standards more than existing law may require
the standards need to be modified
where the employer the collective bargaining unit and the union employee all agree to use the om buds office to address an issue arising under collective bargaining agreement the standards should permit such use
for those issues that are not covered by collective bargaining agreements the standards should authorize an om buds to assist union employees
union employees should not be prevented from the value of the om buds office and should obtain the same benefits from this office as their nonunion peers
though the aba has adopted standards the largest ombudsman organizations disagree with many of its provisions
in light of the opposition by the very profession the aba seeks to regulate the aba should revise its standards so that they are consistent with the best practices and standards that ombudsmen use to regulate their own profession
while attempting to bring general clarity to the om buds role the aba standards have glossed over important differences in roles and functions thus suggesting the need for separate standards and an elimination of size fits approach
while the aba standards recognize four categories of ombudsmen they do not clearly define the fundamentally different orientations of these groups some om buds take an adjudicatory like approach and others are guided by principles of the alternative dispute resolution movement
moreover by emphasizing shared essential characteristics of independence impartiality and confidentiality the aba did not go far enough to describe how om buds operate differently in accordance with these characteristics
organizational legislative executive and advocate om buds may all share common characteristics such as independence impartiality and confidentiality however they each operate differently in accordance with their essential roles
while the goal of all om buds is to resolve disputes each type does so in fundamentally different fashion some relying on facilitation others relying on investigations and others relying on advocacy
in light of the fundamentally different orientations of each om buds category it does not make sense to continue to have uniform standards governing all om buds practices
while the standards unite om buds placing om buds in the same pot makes these guidelines difficult to digest
this article presents recommendations for structuring standards that comport with the orientations of each om buds category
by doing so the aba would better serve to guide the profession and bring focus to field diluted by various adaptations of the om buds model
active bystanders bystander training micro affirmations diversity bystander effect
number of organizations including private sector nonprofit government agencies and universities have been doing bystander
there are at least two reasons to consider engaging all levels of an organization in such encouraging the positive to foster productive behavior from all managers and employees and other members of the organization if any to improve morale and collegiality to and foster discouraging the negative to curtail discriminatory destructive and illegal behavior
at time when employers around the world are concerned about racism bullying harassment ethics and safety violations many managers want to encourage people to react and take appropriate action with respect to unacceptable behavior
although this kind of training appears to have started with respect to topics like safety and diversity training for active bystanders is pertinent to many kinds of behavior
training materials have been developed number of people eg ag ui lar
bystander could be anyone who sees or otherwise becomes aware of behavior that appears worthy of comment or action
in the past much workplace training has focused mainly on three cohorts people who do or say something whether positive or negative that might merit response and people who are impacted by what is said or done and supervisors
there is fourth cohort that is also important there may be one or more bystanders present who can influence the workplace climate
bystanders can highlight positive acts that might otherwise be invisible or overlooked
they can redirect or deescalate negative acts that might be problematic
bystanders might be peers or teammates
they might be subordinate or senior to the person whose comment or behavior warrants reaction
training that encourages into account the different power dynamics and contexts that may be involved
bystander training is designed to help people in all cohorts to to achievements of their fellow workers
we thank stacy blake beard and gi na la roche both affiliates of the center for gender in organizations and the simmons school of management for their excellent contributions to the current state of thinking and teaching about bystander awareness and act io we thank associate editor tom for his very helpful suggestions
see gold stein martin and patters on gr en ny max field mc mill an and on effective persuasion and influence tactics
the hope is that training may help workers in all job categories to be to colleagues who need bit of information for everyone who would be delighted by aw ord of encouragement
the hypothesis is that help and affirmation from bystanders maybe especially effective because it is an immediate positive often unexpected reinforcement
classic discussion of the for similar reasoning
bystander training is also thought to be useful in helping people in all job categories to react and then act appropriately when they see unsafe unprofessional offensive discriminatory or illegal behavior in the workplace
as an example consider the potential importance of aby stander in the realm of cross cultural interactions in affirming the norms of an organization
norm or value at work is only as strong as what happens in the breach of that norm and bystanders may make things there is breach
for example caucasian person who reacts negatively toa racist comment may signal to black employees that there are allies in the organization who share values of commitment to diversity and inclusion
see blake beard turn bull hunt proud ford porter la roche fanning on the importance of cross race allies at work
by the same token the silence of bystanders in such situation can leave minority employees wondering if they are being judged adversely in way that may increase their interest in leaving an organization
exit interviews with minority employees often reveal that it is not just inappropriate remarks by individuals that sting but the silence of awide array of bystanders
see the corporate leavers survey for more about those who leave job ht tp staging
lp fi org workplace corporate leavers
ht ml high ranking bystanders are believed to be especially important in constraining unacceptable behavior by other senior people in circumstances when workers in lower ranks might find action more risky or difficult
why is it useful to think about bystanders
there are number of reasons to encourage bystanders in the workplace to be when action is appropriate
these there are often more peers and bystanders to affirm excellent performance than there are supervisors
the people who go and are often invisible to their supervisors
bystanders can affirm exemplary behavior much more often than bosses if only with quick smile and warm thanks
responsible bystander may be able to react immediately and on the spot at times when action is safe and appropriate
this may be more effective in affirming good behavior or discouraging unacceptable behavior than are reactions that are delayed
in addition affirming useful innovations and catching errors on the spot may be more cost effective than are delayed responses
people who are planning an illegal or otherwise unacceptable action do not usually share their plans with supervisors compliance officers security mental health practitioners or police
they may however boast or give clues to friends and coworkers
see for example fe in pollack bor um mod zel es ki reddy for study of such behavior by school shooters
bystanders have also been identified as key players in reducing the impact of bullies in the schoolyard who feed on bystander attention but often give up if bystanders do not reinforce them co loro so
third parties may be able to help resolve many different kinds of problems amongst people in conflict
social psychologists and ne uro scientists have repeatedly demonstrated how people are affected by the actions of those around them
see the work of who introduced the concept proof
collegiality and even happiness maybe as contagious as the negative emotions
see recently reported work by christ ak is and fowler on the cessation of negative behaviors like smoking and the encouragement of positive behaviors regarding health among people who are connected in social networks and on the contagious nature of happiness
happiness may contribute to workplace morale and good performance and is of course good in and of itself
in short the increased interest in bystander training spans issues and parties in the workplace senior managers who can demonstrate commitment to diversity and inclusion colleagues who can give instant recognition of exemplary performance teammates who can improve work group relations and broad base of workers who can affect cost control and safety
this article reviews some hypotheses about the uses and effectiveness of bystander training as well as some current dilemmas and debates
the word bystander often conjures the bystander
much research on bystanders has examined why some bystanders remain passive dar ley dar ley and there is even popular if controversial term for such passivity namely the effect
some reasons that are cited for the are diffusion of responsibility surely someone else will say something and if others are not doing anything also will not react
further research reported in this issue suggests that in fact many factors contribute to making some bystanders passive in their work places fear of losing friendships fear of loss of privacy fear of consequences fear of getting too involved
bystanders may believe that nothing good will happen if they speak up
they may fear retaliation or be concerned about embarrassing their work group or colleague or their superior ro we wi lc ox gad lin
two hypotheses seem worthy of it may be better for coworkers and colleagues for aby stander to do something even something small or bit clumsy or after the fact than to remain silent when actions warrant with training many bystanders can learn to be more comfortable and appropriate in their responses
some recent research shifts the focus from the numerous inhibitors of active bystander interventions to some of the factors that may enable bystanders ash burn nar do morris good win ro we et al
in this issue of and levi ne and cro wt her
the first step from passive to active bystander is recognizing that something has happened that is worthy of response
bystander training then ushers in useful discussions of was this behavior exemplary or unacceptable
or might feel included or excluded here
without focusing these discussions in way that may trigger discomfort
recognition of socially desirable behavior in order to foster productive and inclusive behavior it is important to train all the cohorts in awork place
all workplace roles are important in thinking about encouraging and commending good teamwork excellent performance and productive human interactions within the workplace
the concept of eg shows move away from the idea of one leader at the top to the idea of leader in every seat
groups may benefit from the practice of micro affirmations ro we which are defined small acts which are often ephemeral and hard to see events that are public and private often unconscious but very effective which occur wherever people wish to help others to succeed
however micro affirmations may be unequally distributed in organizations
this is one of the reasons to be sure that training is offered to all cohorts including bystanders
for example members of predominant group at work or of senior managers may recognize and comment upon one contributions but miss the less understood and appreciated contributions of another group
research on the of women particularly actions that foster collegiality and trust ingroups shows that opportunities at work may be limited when they do not receive appreciation for their different but important types of contributions fletcher
bystander training usually includes observing and practicing range of potential bystander options
scenarios based on real world incidents illuminate bystander training
the scenarios often include micro inequities ro we the seemingly small slights whose impacts may accumulate
here is as ample scenario from participant in bystander training la roche recalled his advice about networking so when he was at the holiday party and saw two colleagues talking to the regional vice president he walked right over to say hello
the vp responded take another white wine please
it took few stunned seconds to realize the vp had mistaken him for waiter and few more stunned seconds to realize his two colleagues were not setting the record straight and introducing him
the apparent micro inequity in this example was exacerbated by the silence of the colleagues who did not correct the biased perception
in an organizational context where power differences are involved bystanders may be help the powerful save face to avoid provoking conflict and to preserve their own status
recent research shows that bystanders with high social dominance orientation who respect authority and reinforce inequality are less likely to respond and respond more slowly to discriminatory remarks or actions rosette hew lin carton
bystander training might emphasize range of responses that the two colleagues in the above scenario might use in order to bring jose into the conversation save face for the vice president andor show their own social adeptness at networking and connecting people la roche
one colleagues might could use more white wine too
should talk to jose about our northeast accounts
jose would you join us for glass of wine too
flag the waiter for four more glasses
that the last two responses not only pivot the prejudiced assumption but bundle in micro affirmation
practice makes it easier to respond instead of freezing in stunned silence
bystander training also permits discussions about the in scenario
it will not be evident to all training participants may have made the vice president in this scenario perceive that hispanic man in nice suit and tie is waiter rather than fellow business colleague
tackling this matter head on in training session might lead to resistance
but such insights may surface as scenario is as pont an eo us focused productive dialogue about the challenges faced by people of color in the us
the impact of active bystanders on in which all people can fully contribute their energies and talents are increasingly valued worldwide
fostering is seen to be important to the bottom line
both affirming wide range of contributions and curtailing inappropriate comments and actions create workplace where all may flourish
bystanders can signal that is real value by praising the contributions of colleague who may normally be ignored by the when an invisible support staff person is thanked in public for various specific contributions by the manager who is accepting an award for her department
lab technician might interrupt inappropriate and escalating personal remarks between two research scientists by shifting the conversation back to the work at hand
agr ac io us supervisor might raise question to clarify who actually contributed to the success of project and then demonstrate concern for appropriate com pen sation for all contributors
professor might assign work that covers the art and architecture of many different religions demonstrating to students from different religions that they are not invisible
manager might gently remonstrate with his peer about thoughtless putdown of new black employee in way that indicates to the new employee that he is not entirely alone
active bystanders can be valuable allies in the workplace
some organizations train across dimensions of diversity to help build inclusive work places in which employees trust that their colleagues will support them appropriately even when they are not in the room
allies provide support not just for other members of their own social identity group but across dimensions of difference
there are challenges in finding and trusting true allies for example between black women and white women but virtuous cycle of trust and support can be created blake beard et al
working collectively rather than as individuals to create an inclusive environment seg al and finding safe space in which to the across differences proud ford maybe helpful with the challenges of the global workplace
encouraging the positive and discouraging the negative may operate as related processes
recent work in neuroscience suggests that much of our decision making is not available to conscious thought
many of the manifestations of bias and of exclusivity are likely to be unconscious
see the at ht tps implicit
one of the few ways of dealing effectively with unconscious bias is to encourage universal mode of respectful and appropriately affirming behavior
this behavior may have two effects to affirm good performance and socially desirable behavior and to block discrimination
several debates are of interest in the area of bystander training in organizations
for example how does unconscious behavior operate
in november review article in the new york times bias test shades of grey john tie rn ey discussed different points of view about unconscious bias
many people agree that unconscious bias that this has been shown by substantial there is controversy about the tools used to measure such bias specifically the mentioned above
many people intuitively agree that micro messages positive and negative appear anecdotally to have significant consequences
however more research would be needed to demonstrate whether and how micro inequities and micro affirmations may actually have consequences in the workplace
in particular more research is needed about the hypothesized linkages between unconscious judgments and workplace behavior
there is also concern in this field as in others about how if at all to demonstrate that training hasan effect on beliefs andor behavior and if so how training may affect different populations
research is also needed on the question of how training might best be presented in various cultures and different kinds of workplace
some employers for example in the us military are working to instill the concept accountability
research is needed to examine how this concept may translate across cultures and in various different languages
is there at which bystanders may have measurable effect on workplace climate
premise of training is not just that individuals become more able to be active bystanders but that the accumulation of many active bystander interventions positively shapes workplace climate
there is anecdotal evidence that after bystander training individuals feel more comfortable in making aby stander move and may even self consciously reference the training in terms such as going to be an active bystander here
in culture where many or all people have experienced bystander training there may be more support for bystanders other bystanders who are present might help and less anti bystander backlash
some participants in bystander training express the worry that bystander might matters worse
this complex concern rests on the interests are at stake

om buds cost effectiveness intangible benefits
conflict management system organizational conflict whistle blower introduction identifying and communicating the usefulness of organizational om buds is vitally important for practitioners and for the profession
this is especially true at time of economic downturn when employ ers need to boost productivity and cut costs and when employees and managers need as much ness and as possible
understanding this topic is however work in progress for oos
we have much to learn we need to have more new ideas and share more evaluations with each other
this article suggests many ways to understand and communicate the value of om buds practice
however the paper does not recommend single minded focus on cost effectiveness analysis for most idea of formal measurement of the cost effectiveness of organizational om buds is hotly debated in the profession
because the question is so important the article begins with discussion of why cost effectiveness analysis is difficult in most organizations and virtually impossible across organizations
the article then pres en ts number of ideas about ways of communicating the usefulness of oos and of the profession
the concern of this author about attempting tra di ti on al cost effectiveness analysis for oos begins with the question of whose goals come first in think ing about effectiveness
according to standards of practice an works independently of ordinary line and staff structures and is designated as neutral
journal of the international ombudsman association an will therefore be considering the interests of many different stake holders
it would seem that oos can not appropriately judge the effectiveness of practice from just the point of view or just their own point of though these are the two stake holders that most often ask about om buds effectiveness
in addition oos do not make management of the of oos happen because of the actions of other people
and the work of oos is largely confidential
since the makes no management decisions and his or her multiple stake holders and in systems improve almost entirely off the record it is hard to collect objective data about the benefits or costs of practice
whatever the difficulties organizational om buds and their all their answers and deserve sound ways of thinking about the usefulness of the profession
this article presents two theses there is no single method of measuring the cost effectiveness of an or the effectiveness of offices across the profession
this is true for methodological reasons some of which are mentioned below
it may however be possible in relevant organizations to estimate some of the costs and benefits of adopting new conflict management system that includes an office
there are also specific narrowly focused ways to assess certain aspects of work
there are many powerful ways of demonstrating usefulness
this article presents ideas as to how an office may be found useful for most or all of its stake holders most of the in multiple ways
understanding how an almost uniquely add value throughout an organizational conflict management system may be the most inter est ing frontier in the field of evaluation si why is it hard to assess effectiveness
this article raises three sets of issues it is dif fi cult to assess benefits it is difficult to assess costs and it is difficult to isolate the effects of an office from the effects of the system with which it works
it is difficult to assess benefits multiple stake holders assessing effectiveness theoretically would require knowing the interests of all the stake holders
who are the stake holders for an
thoughtful analysis turns up long list
even the stake holders may differ from case to case from year to year and from org ani zati on to organization
one would think that true neutral would not be thinking of the benefits to just one of these stake hold ers for example the employer
the may question if it is even ethical to offer estimates of the benefits to the in order for the to justify the existence of the the also estimates benefits to other stake holders
it may however be difficult to estimate the benefits for many stake holders
in some cases it will not be possible to know all the stake holders or even all the stake holders
even the stake holders themselves may not have an view of benefits
an employee or manager may not get desired outcome working with an despite fair assessment and option generation by the om buds
any visitor may be dissatisfied with the inter action with the
any stakeholder including the employer may not understand the ways in which an can and cannot help
by the same token it is quite common for important reasons that might seem to others to be simply put the on pedestal
it follows that one cannot do thorough or analysis of all the benefits from even one office let alone all the benefits accruing in many offices across the profession
having different kinds of stake hold ers handling different sets of issues keeping differ databases and using different methods of data analysis all add to the difficulties in making com pari sons
journal of the international ombudsman association the multiple stakeholder many other differentiate the idea of an on from roi studies of lawyers or other may have one specific client or standard clientele who are likely to deal with nar rower set of issues and whose value added can more easily be differentiated from that of others in the relevant conflict management system
multiple various individual values of assessing effectiveness also requires knowing the goals to be met
what is the formal mission of given office and what are the professional values of the specific
if the missions of various offices vary and if the values held by oos vary and if effectiveness is to be considered in terms of the formal mission of each office and values of each will be difficult to compare practitioners and offices
the role of the standards of practice om buds practice is profession
should oos also be evaluated on the basis of the standards of pr ac only on the basis of the mission of the office and the values of the given practitioner
and om buds need to think through what it means to be effective in circumstances where ad her ing to the standards of practice and the mission of the office appears to be out of sync with the values of senior manager
the importance of context in addition to various missions values and standards there are of course major differences in cultural context for each
as just one example the need for each of the functions of an may vary with context
oos may be valued by their organizations for excelling in different functions
the who delivers respect listens with great skill and is considered likable and trustworthy by all may be superstar in cross cultural communications and con flic ts
another might excel in helping people help themselves only occasionally take an active third party role
the with genius for preventing and mediating intellectual property fights may be greatly valued in research culture desperate for such skills
is it possible to compare the effectiveness of practitioners in completely different contexts
one common idea about management effectiveness has to do with of fit
senior officer might say fits our culture hand in glove
he may look really different but he speaks our language
what if much of success through adaptation or homo ge depends just on
context also matters with respect to the laws regula ti ons policies rules codes of conduct ethnic tra di ti ons and cultural practices that are relevant to each office
the practice of different oos may be quite different depending on what is and is not accept in each organization
who will do the evaluation and is that person objective
who could reasonably assess the effectiveness of an and of an office
for the to be the sole evaluator of his or her practice is obviously not an objective mode
if there are outside evaluators will the evaluations span the interests of many stake holders as neutral might wish
would an external assessor use just the interests that is only use the interests of the people who hire the assessor
would an external assessor offer his or her own methods of assessment or use the terms of reference of the whose office is being assessed
is it possible for anyone outside the office to assess effectiveness objectively considering the paucity of records memories and of the
it may be hard for oos to talk openly about their input to policies as they might customarily work in the background with and through others
it might in fact impede effectiveness to try to take credit for improve men ts in the system
the assessor question is especially important with respect to the value or reproducibility of the assessment
to the extent that different evaluators look at effectiveness in different ways this represents an additional difficulty in attempting to compare practitioners and offices across the profession
long term analysis what is the appropriate time period for effective ness assessment
suppose consistent work by given bears good fruit two or six years later in terms of new and badly needed policy or the resolution of multi year problem
suppose an office visitor is promoted to be vp or
supposing this new vp or is sensationally good at conflict management and gives credit to the who helped him or her
journal of the international ombudsman association assessing intangible benefits as well as tangibles contemporary neuroscience demonstrates that actions decision making and judgments are not necessarily available to conscious thought
ac ti ons and judgments are heavily affected by emotions and
what is the importance of intangible contributions and how can they be assessed
how could effectiveness be assessed and under stood scientifically when intangible benefits cannot be reliably defined
when they cannot be quantified except in proxy variables such as money
many of the perceived intangible benefits of oos are or externalities which are hard to measure in objective terms though they may be quite important
positive externalities of an office would be the benefits for third parties perhaps in the organization or outside of it
for example if new were able to support management to make work place safer or much more respectful some benefits might accrue to the family members of employees and also to society at large
the intangible benefits provided by different practitioners may vary
in some organizations an may appear most effective in one on one inter ac say that this consistently conveys hope and deep respect and appreciation as well as good concrete options
this is constantly coach ing wide variety of visitors and assisting at prob le mat ic meetings to help beleaguered supervisors to succeed
people say this gives up but will keep working on concern for months if need be
this answers every email and phone call within hours and is seen to be exceptionally in world where few senior people are responsive
much of the effectiveness of this is regularly ascribed to his or her skill in building relationships and integrity discretion and trustworthiness as well as to skill in generating options for those in conflict
but contrast this image of effectiveness with that of another who is greatly valued but mainly for recommending and helping with conflict manage ment systems improvements and public collaborative organizational change projects
how might these contributions be assessed and compared with those of the first practitioner
some offices are seen to be particularly good at surfacing very bad problems very early in way that leads to timely attention to bad problems and no outside whistle blowing
suppose the benefit of these seen by the and risk entirely in terms of contributing to and protecting the public image of the employer
reputation al risk could be characterized in financial terms of course but is this useful yardstick across the profession
finally one can compare these images of effectiveness with that of an employer who establishes an office simply because it is required by regulation to have this kind of safe way of reporting illegal the employer wants to have an to reduce potential penalties under the us sentencing guidelines
this kind of is so to speak simply by exist it is difficult to assess costs there are also methodological questions about cost analyses of offices that the profession may wish to examine
organizational costs and costs for individuals most discussions of costs in effectiveness analysis have focused on organizational costs
theoretically for neutral who is looking at the interests of all stake holders there could be some estimates of costs saved or engendered for those who have contact with the from organizational costs
many oos report that significant number of their visitors choose the option of learning how to deal with concerns on their own
especially if visitor is in conflict with peer there may be no action by the or any other third party
visitor may think through options with and then settle concern directly
this would likely decrease the and hopefully although not certainly decrease the costs for the person who was the object of complaint
it is not clear how to think about the tangible and in tan gib le costs to individuals but this is topic that might be of interest to the om buds profession short term vs
long term analysis would an organizational cost analysis be based on annual financial costs
does this make sense in terms of the mission and practice of an office where desired benefits may be long term as well as short term
journal of the international ombudsman association social costs would the analysis include social costs nonmonetary costs and intangibles affecting groups as well as individuals
for example suppose that an alert from an led to exposure of many illegal aliens or to the shutting down of particular workplace
or to the fir ing of well loved doctor or religious leader or teach er or politician who has engaged in criminal behavior
an alert might lead to appropriate action but the social costs might seem very high for many people in the organization and there might be externalities of this kind outside the organization
it is even con ce iv able that backlash might lead to deep distrust of the in such situation
another possible might be that of serious burnout for an
increased costs due to the it is not even clear how to estimate all the financial costs of an
should the analysis include costs in addition to the annual budget of the office
as an example suppose the makes mistake
virtually all professionals will occasionally make mistakes like forgetting to follow up on something and mistakes sometimes result in increased costs for the employer
might the work of an excellent actually increase costs in given year for the employer
for example imagine that an alert from the triggers an ex pensive investigation
imagine that an alert from the triggers long term changes in computer security systems or safety program or the need for new employment lawyer
it could happen that the perceived trustworthiness of new means that there is new cascade of serious concerns of certain kind
these might be ethics cases or bullying cases or racial or sexual harassment cases that had hitherto not come to light
it is not clear how to estimate the costs of the line management time and the time of hr and counsel etc
is this an office management system question
and should an analyst who is assessing such short term cost increases plan to take account of the fact that the costs over time might possibly decrease due to alerts from the
decreased costs due to the may help reduce the costs of conflict among employees and among example in turnover and time lost to bickering
as result pro might increase in certain department or on cross cultural team
however it may not be clear whether to calculate this effect as cost saving or benefit from increased productivity or both
it also is not easy to make such calculations
it is often thought to be the case that the work of an very significantly decreases the costs of line man age ment time and legal staff in dealing with com plaints
however it is not always clear how to attribute such cost saving
what are the achievements of the how much credit should be given to the people in conflict who have settled their concern with the help of the and what are the achievements of anyone else who may have helped in the situation
it is difficult to isolate the effects of an office from the effects of the conflict management system with which the is working
the profession does not have conceptual model of how to think about who should get credit for successful conflict management in an organization with an and conflict management system
the profession also needs conceptual model for assess ing intangible and tangible conflict management benefits when visitor works with an and then personally settles conflict with another person
how can one assess the effectiveness of an separately from that of the people with whom the works
this may be especially difficult if the is working very hard to support and help to improve the whole
imagine that the regularly is able to get good new ideas and quick catches of bad problems to the relevant managers
and then further imagine that the relevant managers are constantly instituting good new ideas and rectifying problems as result
many oos work very hard not to substitute for line and staff management but to themselves out of as fast as possible with each case
many oos pride themselves on keeping low profile while constantly supporting the system to improve
the more effective the low profile the more difficult it is to analyze contributions of just the
how an may add value to an organizational con management system may be the most interesting frontier in the field of effectiveness assessment
journal of the international ombudsman association research in this area is very much needed
have suggested elsewhere four challenges that are faced by every conflict management an office may almost uniquely help to where usefulness might be studied and how to help everyone in an organization feel they can act effectively if they wish come forward on timely basis they have serious how to help coordinate the system and provide back how to help keep the system itself and its managers and professional staff accountable how to help the to improve by learning from the ways in which conflict and con have been addressed and how to encourage management to respond to re commenda ti ons
various ideas about demonstrating the usefulness of oos what might an do to understand and dem on strate the effectiveness or at least the usefulness of his or her office
writers in this issue will contribute many ideas
various organizations may also have their own ideas about effectiveness
for example if an organization has longstanding office perhaps there will be ways to track how given practitioner performs from year to year
does he or she constantly work with relevant groups on new system initiatives
if an org ani za ti on has multiple access routes for surfacing ethics problems can the office be compared over time to other access points to see which kinds of callers choose which paths for which issues
does the consistently surface and help to resolve issues that are judged to be important for significant part of the organization
there appear to be many possibilities for assessment that might be useful that are not necessarily ex pen and which may respond to some of the method ological questions above
many of the assessments below can be compared over time
many of these ideas are relevant to both tangible and intangible interests of multiple stake holders including shareholders management at all levels visitors those who call upon the office people who are alleged to be problem responders those whom the calls about case or an issue the employees and man ag ers in the organization who do not use the office other groups that are relevant in specific org ani za students and also to society
this article first suggests some benefits from the office that are most easily seen only at time of cif ic change
the article then lays out some benefits that can be demonstrated day by some changes in effectiveness of the whole conflict management the be measured at times of specific and visible re org ani za ti on
identifying the effectiveness of major systems changes that introduce practitioners occasionally it may be possible to measure the ef fec of major change in conflict management system that occurs together with the introduction of practitioners
there are few organizations where part of the con management mission is highly focused
for exam specialized organization like hospital might wish to offer an alternative approach to dealing with outcomes for variety of reasons to assist providers in disclosing adverse outcomes to patients andor families to improve patient safety by promoting greater transparency in reporting errors and making more immediate system improvements and to reduce the financial costs of errors negligence malpractice insurance and wide variety of legal and settlement costs
situations like this can be studied for their po ten ti al cost savings for many stake holders in addition to the for intangible as well as tangible benefits for number of stake holders
hospital might decide on changes in its conflict management the introduction of an office
the new office may not produce major benefits and reduce costs all by itself but rather journal of the international ombudsman association an evolving new produce many measurable benefits and reduce costs
for example in hospital the might be able to work with health care providers hospital staff family members and patients in cases involving ed outcomes
the could serve multiple functions as compassionate face of the organization when unexpected harm occurs as coach to providers who are charged with disclosing the harm as an internal neutral who assists in resolution between patients and providers that avoids the need for litigation and as confidential source of information to leadership on potential systemic and individual problems
early prototypes suggest great relief for many patients and their families and high rates of satisfaction when health care providers immediately call in an after an unanticipated outcome
one can imagine the in tangible benefits for everyone from permitting health care providers to express their own emotions and even to offer apologies to working with patients and families to uncover what their true interests might be post event
for example these interests might be in the form of complete disclosure and timely in forma ti on appropriate compensation fixing the system that led to harm andor honoring the individual whose harm led to system improvements
there may also be significant intangible benefits for admin is tra staff as well as clinical staff as an entire system continuously learns from experience
early prototypes also suggest significant cost savings in terms of reducing the financial costs of perceived or alleged negligence and malpractice and pain and suffering
over time one can imagine significant savings in terms of malpractice costs and slowly for the health care system of the country
one can also this kind of conflict management system integrated into the quality improvement and patient safety hospital may learn more quickly about errors and how to prevent them
and methods of preventing ubiquitous oversights and errors might become even more widely accepted when errors are more easily surfaced
having respectful come immediately to the scene after every unanticipated adverse outcome might help in role modeling active listening and attention to feelings for the occasional insensitive health care provider
multi year evaluations may show that systems change works even better in later years than in the first year
benefits and cost savings from specific initiatives estimates might also be made as to various kinds of benefits and cost savings from specific initiatives
as hypothetical example imagine that the decides to work hard with many members of the or ga ni zati on on the issue of bullying
this will probably be most successful after bad case that goes public
suppose the were to ask relevant managers for help in quick estimate of the health care costs turn over costs lost time and legal costs and settlements that may be directly attributable to bullying
in addition since bullying can be telltale for other forms of unacceptable and unethical behavior the might ask for or try to make estimates of related costs that might be somewhat reduced if the em ploy er were to address the problem of bullying in an effective fashion
that is it might happen that pay ing serious attention to bullying might measurably reduce other unacceptable behavior as well
possible examples include serious errors assault embezzle ment harassment safety violations petty sabotage serious sabotage anonymous attacks against man ager on the certain kinds of super vi sory incompetence
in addition an might be able to communicate that prevention of bullying could improve the workplace in important intangible ways for everyone in the for family members as well
the might share research with man ag ers about the potential intangible as well as tangible impacts of bullying
the might then ask for anonymous surveys or focus groups to assess reactions to pro civility anti bullying initiative
here the contribution of the will be in alerting and working with and supporting the conflict management system
some real examples conveyed to this author il lu mi nate the fact that adding an office to an exist ing system may produce some measurable systems benefits or measurably reduce costs
in one federal agency adding new office reduced costly fo ia and ee oc complaints to near zero in the first year
in another federal agency in his first year new was able to settle many dozens of class action suits through skillful mediation
many new oos report having been able to work with supervisors to rectify journal of the international ombudsman assoc ia ti ona number of longstanding annoyances
some have helped managers to make quick progress in the first year or two with serious safety problems
new oos frequently report having been able to offer some illumination of the concerns of one or another group in the organization
several new oos have recorded dozens of systems changes made by man ag ers that made life more equitable for trig ger ed at least in part by concerns brought to the office
others have lists of systems changes that have made life more equitable for various minority groups various religious and national groups persons with disabilities and lb gt groups
in number of corporations new oos appear to have reduced the costs of litigation and settlements in sig nific ant ways saving legal costs for the conflict man age ment system may in fact be relatively common with new
in one university legal costs were low for many years compared with peer institutions
this was attributed to the fact that the system had an office that helped identify emergent issues in low key way for line supervisors to assess and manage
faith based organization in major city established an office resembling an office
many years later the organization was dozens of allegations about abuse
there were relatively few allegations in the city with the
in most of these examples the benefits and cost reductions could likely be ascribed at least in part to the management system the rather than just to the
some of these examples are in nature and some would be hard to assess in objective terms
nevertheless it would appear to be useful to ask all new oos to keep narrative of their first few years
the profession might this way collect more examples of changes that appear to have been facilitated by new identifying and communicating effectiveness on regular basis internal assessment of the caseload in terms of the mission the might institute regular internal assessment of the work of the office in terms of the office mission
as just one example if is part of the mission of the employer and part of the mission of the office one might compare broad aggregates and estimates of the and of office vi si tors of those who use the office to those in the organization
is the being used throughout vari constituencies
if not are there good reasons why not
and if the caseload does reasonably reflect the constituencies might the wish to highlight this fact in various communications
review of alleged areas or problematic cohorts as another part of the mission if systems change is also part of the mission in what ways are oos supporting responsible systems change
the might track the characteristics of the perceived sources of the problems well as the is are mentioned in an office
that is the data collection system might be designed to include aggregate characteristics of alleged and some characteristics of the cohorts alleged by visitors to be sources of problems
demographic analysis can illuminate for every cohort which cohorts are most often seen to be problem
for example the analysis could show whether uni support staff report significant problems more with administrators or with students
geographic analysis may also be useful
as an unusual example cross tabulating by the geo graphics of permits the to track the proportion of people who are alleged to be the source of problem who are not even in the org ani za ti on these sometimes costly concerns may be on the rise for many organizations
patterns of this kind may be useful information for managers
for example it is now widely understood that women as well as men are responsible for per ce pt ions of harassment including sexual and racial harassment
and that men as well as women may be bullied and harassed
recognition of relevant patterns may lead to more effective policies structures and training programs
oos may wish to track their work every year on relevant systems change with regard to issues and areas that are perceived to be problematic
ideally there may be important changes in policies or pro ce dures or structures where it will be obvious to the colleagues with whom the has worked that the played useful role
an might even inquire of such colleagues whether the office was seen to be journal of the international ombudsman association helpful in bringing information or in offering options that relevant managers found to be useful
this kind of analysis may then illuminate the usefulness of the office for various different stake holders
anonymous feedback the might analyze his or her published mis sion standards of practice and values and provide anonymous feedback forms constructed around these standards and values
in small offices forms can simply be given to all visitors alleged offenders and responders to be mailed back anonymously
in larger enterprises an external feedback vendor can collect anonymous evaluations
anonymous evaluations may help to assess perceptions of reduced or heightened costs from the actions of an and perceptions of benefits
in some organizations the feedback from such forms is almost entirely laudatory or sharply bimodal but the prose on form may help the practitioner to know how she or he has if the reverse is true how the is seen not to have been helpful
for example if the is seen not to have been helpful does this mean the should do better in comm uni cating what an can and cannot do
problems unknown to the organization or unrecognized one of the most important functions of an is to help everyone in an organization feel they can act ef fe ct ive ly if they wish come forward on timely they have serious concerns
research suggests that many people hesitate to act when they see unacceptable behavior
an office that is trusted may help to surface serious problems timely and in house
in complex world many organizations have highly specialized senior managers
there may be few offices that receive data from the entire organization and from every cohort
frequently an can piece together small bits of information to see an emergent problem or pattern before it is obvious to others
as the analyzes the caseload every week month and year how is it different
does the caseload indicate anything that management or the organization does not know and needs to know
ideally an can communicate promptly in way that is completely consonant with confidential management and as relevant to the whole organization
if the picks up new problems and especially new problems that might be disruptive to established procedures or require new policies or new training programs the office will be known for prov id ing helpful and support
as an illustration after the advent of computers an began to hear from one or another computer many different parts of the various forms of repetitive strain injury
the was able to collate these reports identity free and to work with several managers to estimate some of the potential damage and future costs of repetitive strain injuries
the was then able to support dozens of colleagues who designed an extensive program to help prevent
reports of and costs over ten year period were then significantly reduced
as similar example an was able in the early to recognize and report isolated instances of fear in the workplace of related infectious and then fear of aids
over number of months managers in the organization were able to put together policies and training to respond
if the picks up problems like and fear of aids that need coordinated address by many different managers across the organization the may be able to foster informal coordination within the conflict management system
an can suggest where back up is needed
the continued support of an may help to encourage managers to keep learning about given issue and to keep learning from each other
constantly listening and reporting back to many stake holders the might regularly introduce the office and himself or herself to every group and cohort that extends an invitation
some oos routinely introduce themselves to all new department heads and senior managers
many oos welcome invitations to lunch time meetings of support staff specialized profession als new employees and others
meetings of this sort provide chance to share current issues and annual reports and to make appropriate mention of work that is relevant to the audience
as an example in talking with groups of nonexempt employees in the us the might mention the common issue of un compensated overtime and the relative ease of deal ing with this problem through generic discussions in departmental meetings
journal of the international ombudsman association in each introduction there would of course be to listen and if relevant to begin to develop an explicit plan to to the group or new manager in terms of their specific interests
some oos are requested to get back to line man ag ers immediately whenever the practitioner can offer information in way completely consonant with con fid en ti ality that will permit the manager to be more effective
some oos see every senior officer at least once year to give an aggregated report about the senior area and to ask the senior officer about plans in that area for the coming year
every time that the learns of some important new issue or new solution to problem the might think which groups and supervisors would wish to be informed
each time the is invited to group or talks with supervisor or manager she or he might ask am doing
am providing useful in forma ti on and options
is there any way the office could be more useful
checking in and stopping by on an in for mal basis may also serve to support managers and professional staff to be accountable and to continue to support improvements in conflict management
the should always be prepared to answer the question from manager is in it for me
inclusion in climate surveys the might ask to be included in relevant org ani za ti on al surveys
climate issues relevant to management or to given cohort or business help to measure if the office is known used and valued
survey might ask if person has used the office and then follow up with more questions if so what would you have done if you had not been able to contact an
would you have raised the would you have raised it as quickly
might you have left the organization
do you feel that contact with the office has decreased stress for you or other from the problem or added any difficulties
do you feel that you may now deal more effectively with future issues
would you recommend the office to others
if you have responded to call from the you trust the office
do you feel that contact with the office has decreased stress for you or other from the problem that was addressed or added any difficulties
would you yourself use the office or recommend the office to others
for persons who have not had contact with the office there might be questions about aware ness trust and willingness to refer
answers can be compared for those who have or have not had contact with the office and by the geo gra of those taking the survey
in many cases these surveys can be compared over time
annual reports web site materials and training some oos make annual reports to the organization
these reports may or may not be as useful to man ag ers as are frequent personal reports but they can be very useful in letting everyone in the organization know about the office and what it does
they demonstrate that the is accountable
for the who painstakingly self evaluates annual reports may provide way to communicate some of his or her achievements
many annual reports reflect the kinds of issues that come in and make recommendations about te na problems and beneficial solutions if any
there may be description of problems
the reports may communicate the cohorts that use the office
re ports may present analyses about how many people are affected by the problems that have been reviewed and report on some of the changes that have been made in response to concerns
reports may also mention some of the results from anonymous surveys about the office
some oos maintain web site with policy in forma ti on referral links for other offices in the conflict management system useful links to conflict re so lu ti on materials and articles and many materials of use to people in the organization for
some oos post short articles guidelines and advisories
hits on the web site can be tracked over time to see which sources of help are seen to be useful
of particular importance the other web sites maintained by the conflict management tem which mention the help com mu ni cate the possibility of making anonymous reports and asking questions anonymously
most oos do some kind of training about issues and conflict management skills that are important to the organization
these events are important for com munic ating about the office giving out brochures and short advisories and building well as communicating about various issues and skills
journal of the international ombudsman association which were the five or six most serious problems and issues last year
probably the easiest way to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of an office is when both visitors and senior officers know that very serious problems have been identified in time in house via the
frequently the serious are known to at least few senior managers or can be described to the in ways that do not identify the people who came forward
an may sometimes be able to get permission from visitor to make sure that is not blind sided by bad way that is greatly appreciated
probably every long term can remember notable moments when it was clear that they have made unusual contributions
many oos have helped to sur face delicate information about senior managers and other vips as well as about other employees
many have been able to help get potentially difficult si tua ti ons settled appropriately but out of the public eye
several oos report having persuaded visitors to give up guns and other weapons
number of oos report having forestalled immediately threatened violence to self or others
at least one persuaded an arsonist to give himself up
number of oos report having provided early and effective warning of serious en vi ron mental hazards
several oos have helped visitor with an unrecognized emergency medical condition to receive medical help in time
many om buds routinely help to surface concerns about alleged misuse of money and equipment vandalism and sabotage and deliberate inter fer en ce with the integrity of the work of others serious conflicts of interest thefts of money and intellectual property the coverup of serious errors and wide variety of fraudulent behavior
at one om buds conference at workshop on pos sib le national security problems three oos came up afterward to talk about having alerted managers to serious issues while protecting the identities of those who provided information
helping to resolve painful issues in family owned firm or among valued senior managers may help stabilize company
helping to retain very valued professional may save great deal of money
are senior officers deeply concerned about diversity and inclusion
working on coordinated systems initiative to foster mentor ing nontraditional employees and managers to help as an antidote to discrimination as well as helping every one
one terrible racial or sexual harassment case or criminal abuse or embezzlement problem if surfaced very quickly may pay for the cost of an
averting serious sabotage or serious safety issue or nation al security event will be seen to justify the existence of the office that helped to surface the problem
organizational om buds have much to contrib ute to organizations
oos have much to contribute to many stake holders including shareholders man age ment at all levels visitors those who call upon the office people who are alleged to be problem responders those whom the calls about case or an issue the employees and managers in the organization who do not directly use the office other groups that are relevant in specific students and also to society
oos contribute in dozens of different ways using wide variety of conflict management functions and many different skills in many different environments
om buds need to learn how to identify and com munic ate their usefulness
they need to describe short term and long term tangible and intangible contributions in ways that are relevant to their own stake holders
one thesis of this article is that there are many ways to do so
the other thesis of this article is that there is no single way to calculate the cost effectiveness of oos
the evaluation of om buds practice raises many ques ti ons suitable for research and for om buds discus si ons
these questions begin with identification of the goals and modes of practice of each and each office
major complexity derives from the fact that many of the achievements of an om buds come through the actions of others
the profession needs some new conceptual models for understanding effectiveness for example who should get credit for what kinds of successful conflict management in an organization with an and conflict management system
how might analysts assess the benefits of having an when visitor works closely with an and then personally settles conflict with another person
oos are independent and neutral but are not really contributors
oos work with and through journal of the international ombudsman association their visitors with those who are seen to be prob with responders of all kinds and with everyone in the relevant conflict management system
oos cannot just look at their own actions to understand effectiveness
oos need to assess their skills and usefulness with skepticism but also with vision not to overclaim nor undervalue what oos can as individuals and as an unusual independent neutral addition to system
as gaw ande has recently written conditions of increasing complexity in medicine and elsewhere experts require different set of values than had
we require greater hu about our abilities greater self discipline and the prizing of teamwork over individual prowess
oos may add value identify their usefulness and communicate their usefulness with all or most of their stake holders is compelling challenge

finally there is an unheralded group of oos who have pioneered in curriculum and skill development accreditation office design and office management conference preparation participation and management committee work liaison with interested organizations ce os external colleagues and opponents peer recruitment mentor ing and peer evaluations research and teaching writing and editing who are taken together responsible for the successes in identifying and communicating the usefulness of oos around the world
om buds association org standards for the standards of practice
oos typically help to develop and offer options to visitors to people who are seen to have offended others and to responders and managers rather than prescribing solutions
thus the person or people who choose an option and take an action are likely to be the people directly responsible for achievements in the domain
an insightful anonymous reviewer pointed out that evaluation of this kind of professional practice may lend itself to the methodologies of investigators like anthropologists using techniques like the study of so called naturally occurring experiments
for example one can do anonymous surveys in an organization about satisfaction with the office
or collect specific kinds of cost savings like measuring any reduced costs of lawsuits and agency complaints with new
the term conflict management system in this article includes all the people in an organization who regularly deal with conflict and have an interest in preventing unnecessary conflict

ht ml for example it could happen that an alert from an about racial concern might result in recruitment and management actions that produce better racial climate in given department
these actions might affect many people directly and indirectly in the short term and over many years
although most oos are oos may also develop specialized expertise in order to meet the needs of their organizations and perhaps because of their own interests
word of mouth may then advertise these skills
the may thereafter attract more visitors with the same concerns
the caseload of one may thus be somewhat different from another in very similar organization
in like manner the is likely to construct and expand the office database to reflect specific or changing caseload
one might categorize given case in the database quite differently than would another
and various oos will deal with more or fewer earthshaking issues
there is no standardized database although the offers useful database recommendations to members as result of extensive work by the uniform reporting categories task force
that task force was charged to work on categories rather than considering all database questions
for example there is little discussion of what might be useful analyses of the data
as just one example of different methods used by different oos some oos only collect few demographic and journal of the international ombudsman association geographic data about their visitors cohorts approach the office
others also collect few data about the persons offices or groups who are perceived by visitors to present problems cohorts and areas are thought to be at fault
others collect few data points about responders are the kinds of people that call to look into problem
of course none of these data sets identify individuals
but each data set reflects different issues who approaches the
who is helpful in looking into an issue
another difference among practitioners is represented by different ways of discussing work
as one example some oos speak of those who approach the office as
others never use this word concerned that the term compromises the appearance and reality of neutrality and it changes thinking
others try nearly universally to offer for the choice of the visitor
some oos think of themselves as part of their conflict management system and some think of themselves as an unusual neutral professional working with their conflict management system
some oos think of om buds work as dispute resolution often meaning that they are seeking interest based solutions
others think of oos as supporting dispute resolution meaning that they also may help visitors to gain access and prepare for options based on rights and power if that is the choice of the visitor
all such differences might affect evaluations of work
frank fowl ie see his doctoral dissertation op cit
and howard gad lin and elizabeth pino in their booklet on neutrality have written about om buds having their own professional values in addition to standards of practice
all standards of practice oos by definition follow certain standards
but some oos might especially espouse the concept of
others might especially convey respect for reconciliation
some think first about social justice and others about and
in order to affirm neutrality as mentioned above some oos strive never to give advice but always to offer options
in all of these cases the advice one might offer and options one develops may be informed by values
values may thus affect the practice of each consciously or not

am grateful to clarence williams in personal communications for his suggestion that delivering respect and active listening may be the most cost effective uses of an time in terms of the interests of the organization
this question highlights the importance of studying what happens in an office and in professional communications as howard gad lin and few others have tried to the importance of considering the research methods of anthropologists behavioral economists social psychologists and the importance of writing composite and identity free stories and narratives

see gaw ande better picador and the checklist to get things right metropolitan books
with respect to legal costs many oos have noticed that perceived bullying sometimes appears to be the factor that tilts complainant into formal grievances and lawsuits
for example where the tracks multiple issues that are reported by visitors the could look at the extent to which bullying is usually reported as the only together with other serious issues
see for example harvard business review april how toxic colleagues corrode performance the impact of rudeness by christine po rath and christine pears on

for example better recruitment mentor ing and performance evaluation initiatives are likely to serve the interests of all cohorts
the same is likely to be true for pro civility anti harassment initiatives
describe example by gender and job cohort
might refer to the country or division where the visitor or the alleged offender works
many oos just make informed guesses and keep only sketchy data about the demographics and geographics of those who call upon the office
some visitors are anonymous and often an does not need to know very much about visitor or caller in order to discuss policies and the pros and cons of responsible options sometimes there are not lot of data about the people attached to case
the use of these make comparisons with the known therefore be quite imprecise but still be useful over time
here again the identity free and aggregated data will likely be imprecise but may be useful year by year if collected the same way each year

early examples include sexual harassment seven years before the ee oc guidelines misuse of federal resources decade before the pac ka rd commission report stalking and obsessed following behavior six to eight years before most state laws
contemporary reported by several oos is the proportion of people outside the organization bringing serious complaints against people in the the number of serious complaints by members of the organization against people outside the organization
another in some organizations is the apparent significant increase in the number of issues per case
another is an increase in boundary crossing cases that include several different cohorts different national and language and religious groups many different issues different sets of laws and regulations and that are in other ways very complex
each like these may call for new policies procedures structures or training programs in the organization
some early research on practice suggested that oos themselves have believed that their helping to surface sexual and racial harassment and bullying may be particularly cost effective
gaw ande it in the new york times book review january letters section
in every historical era many people have sought to carry out good work
it has always been true that some people do their work expertly but not very responsibly
people who do good are clearly skilled in one or more professional realm
at the same time rather than merely following money or fame alone or choosing the path of least resistance when in conflict they are thoughtful about their responsibilities and the implications of their work
howard gar dn er mi ha ly and william damon good work assessments of ombudsman effectiveness ought to support our efforts to do good work
toward that end assessments should focus on meeting our resp on si bi li ties and examining the implications of our work
our responsibilities are shaped and continuously reshaped within the framework established by our standards of practice the implications of our work are discernable within the organizations in which we practice
consequently there ought to be two enc es for any examination of the effectiveness of an ombudsman program the organization within which the ombudsman functions and the ombudsman program itself
since our responsibilities are shaped by our sops to my mind any discussion of assessing ombudsman effectiveness should meet two criteria
there should be parallel between the standards for designing an ombudsman program and the dimensions along which an ombudsman program is evaluated
any assessment of an ombudsman program ought to provide information that helps the ombudsman staff improve the quality of their work and the om organization improve the effectiveness of its program
journal of the international ombudsman association to better understand this approach it can be helpful to differentiate between the reasons for establishing an ombudsman program and the motives for estab lish ing an ombudsman program
in my experience there are many motives for developing an om buds man programs
among the ones have heard men ti on ed most frequently are controlling the costs of conflict reducing lawsuits or complaints im proving morale among an employees members legally mandated need for an alternative dispute resolution program
in many instances an organization has decided it needed an ombudsman program after major organizational crisis such as the revelation of undetected or overlooked major ethical violations
events such as these point to the primary reason for establishing an ombudsman program the need for an informal confidential independent channel by which all members of an organization can explore and pursue complaints and grievances and raise concerns without fear of retaliation and with the knowledge that they will be treated fairly and that their issues will be addressed honestly and impartially
it is in the nature of large bureaucratic organizations that their internal dynamics create impediments against people bringing forward issues and concerns that point to individual and structural problems within the organization
it is in the nature of large bureaucratic organizations that important information that could matter enormously for the better management and functioning of the organization is kept from the very people who could use it
an ombudsman program that is doing can be an effective way to address these needs
most discussions of ombudsman effectiveness make me nervous because they appear to ignore the core principles of neutrality confidentiality and inde pen den ce and they are not anchored in consideration of the standards of practice
instead these discus si ons seem informed by an often unacknowledged desire to determine the best approach to selling or justifying the ombudsman program to the org ani za ti on within which it functions
mind you in tight economy where organizations are scrutinizing many of their programs to decide what can be cut and what is too costly such an orientation makes certain sense
indeed there have been several instances in the past few years of organizations dropping their ombudsman programs
still the concern to provide justification of an ombudsman office in terms of cost effectiveness moves us away from recognizing and reinforcing the reasons for an ombudsman program
over many years in the dispute resolution world have seen large number of reports claiming to demonstrate the effectiveness of ombudsman pro grams mediation programs and integrated conflict management systems and not single one of those reports was grounded in the standards of practice
is there view that the sops are an es senti al or important part of the practice
in fact they may be rather unimportant to the organizational leadership relegated to the arena of the preferred jargon
instead reports focus on matters such as the number of cases handled or persons seen settlements rates disputant satis fac ti on ratings increases or decreases in the number of complaints filed and most annoyingly claims of savings in time and money
these latter often take the form of calculating the costs in terms of time and personnel of the handling of case from intake through settlement and then comparing that cost with what the cost would have been had the case gone thorough to litigation
you can imagine the astronomical savings one can project through this methodology
aside from the suspect nature of such statistical manipulations approaching the assessment of effectiveness in this way is direct insult to the very idea of ombudsman independence
ella wheat on one of the most distinguished om buds practitioners always used to remind us that we need to be careful not to subtly make management decisions by settling cases in order to produce the right results for the head of the organization
let me be clear am not in principle or in reality opposed to using various legitimate measures of cost effectiveness customer satisfaction lawsuits avoided conflicts resolved etc
to point to some of the value added to an organization by having an ombudsman
but am opposed to having the value added sen sib il being the primary and most important framework within which the ombudsman program is assessed
will return to the measuring effectiveness issue below but first want to address the importance of placing our standards of practice at the very center of any ef forts to think about effectiveness
when first arrived at there was in place an exist ing mediation program that served support staff for the infrastructure small proportion of the roughly workforce
the program had very high settlement rate and had gathered variety of mea journal of the international ombudsman association sures meant to prove its value to the parts of the or ga ni zati on it served
however when looked into their actual functioning found very different picture mediators who were far from neutral in their conduct and director who bullied people into settlements and who regularly violated confidentiality she was not an ombudsman but mediation programs have similar commitment to confidentiality and neutrality
fortunately was able to demonstrate to the org ani zati on that this program despite its ostensible cess could undermine the very rationale behind the establishment of an ombudsman program
while do not know exactly how do think we must find ways of assessing whether or not our ombudsman programs actually follow our standards of practice
and the only way know we can do this is to move toward opening up our practices to researchers who can study first hand what it is we actually do
am not alone in this view
our professional journal of the international ombudsman association recommended this practice and received the board of directors approval
it is with this in mind that turn back to the assessing ef fe ct ive ness issue
in recent years there has been considerable discus sion about measuring teacher effectiveness in the schools
this is an incredibly complex issue and it has elicited very complicated discussion
one aspect of this debate has to do with measuring effectiveness in terms of the scores students achieve on the standardized tests of achievement
major point of controversy about using this measure is whether it forces teachers to choose between teaching general knowledge and the skills to acquire it and the test
there are significant implications of the ter ia selected
massive amounts of potential funding are distributed in part based on this one criteria of success
when listen to our discussions about measuring effectiveness worry about creating schema within which ombudsmen will to the measures pushing for higher resolution rates or unconsciously altering their styles in ways that are not neutral in for mal confidential and independent in order to receive higher customer satisfaction ratings
this is not to ar gue against the use of quantitative measures
among the most thoughtful participants in the teacher ef fec discussion has been group called for america
but this group while employing test score results as one indicator of teacher effective ness has also begun an intensive observational based analysis of what it is exceptional teachers do that leads to their success
if believed that we as prof es sion were prepared to expose our practice to com pa rab le scrutiny would have more faith that we might learn something useful for our actual practice worth while from quantitative measures
of course there are significant confidentiality issues to be addressed but they can be addressed and ought not to be an excuse for shielding ourselves from critical examination
as steven from teach for america said recently teachers insist that effective teaching is neither mysterious nor magical
it is neither function of dynamic personality nor dramatic performance
anyone who has ever been to gathering of om buds is aware of how often we romanticize what we do and who we are
while such talk may reassure and affirm us it does little to advance our work or our profession
and certainly when an ombudsman colleague for another institution is hired to assess the functioning of our programs we cannot really fool ourselves into believing that such an assessment constitutes an impartial and objective analysis
fortunately in addition to teacher effectiveness there are other domains in which the quest for data based understanding promises to help us understand mat te rs where previously we were totally dependent on the opinions of the designated experts
we all un der stand the importance of getting an independent and impartial assessment of an activity or treatment or an intervention
considerable attention has been paid recently to the area of comparative effectiveness research comparative effectiveness research is the conduct and synthesis of systematic research comparing different interventions and strate gies to prevent diagnose treat and monitor health conditions
the purpose of this research is to inform patients providers and decision makers responding to their expressed needs about which interventions are most effective for which patients under specific circumstances
to provide this information comparative effective ness research must assess comprehensive array of health related outcomes for diverse patient populations
defined interventions compared may include medications procedures medical and assistive devices and technologies behav journal of the international ombudsman assoc ia ti oni oral change strategies and delivery system interventions
this research necessitates the development expansion and use of variety of data sources and methods to assess comparative effectiveness
amanda rip ley makes great the atlantic
of course what we do is not the same as what doctors do and the tasks of measurement of effectiveness are not at all comparable but they are similar and there could be lessons for us regarding the sort of stance we ought to take towards our work
luckily for us the academic world is filled with researchers interested in the study of organizational dynamics institutional change and dispute resolution processes and programs
believe it is time for us to develop collaborative relationships with researchers guided by accepted ethical guidelines and protections who can independently examine and assess the work that we do the way that we do it and the impact that we have
for years now we have argued that org ani za ti ons have much to benefit from establishing an om buds man program to function as an independent and impartial site for organizational self analysis
surely we can see the wisdom of following our own advice and applying it to ourselves
effectiveness ombudsman charter survey om buds man policies the ombudsman office at alliance bern stein was established in august
global financial man age ment firm alliance bern stein is highly attuned to measurements of performance
this case describes the development of the office its charter and the po li applying to the office how expectations for the office were set and the nature of the methods used to evaluate whether the office met those expectations
alliance bern stein had long believed that the formal processes such as legal and compliance human resources risk management and audit provided suf fi cie nt opportunities for employees to address their concerns if they saw risk of wrongdoing
however in spite of having robust management audit and compliance presence in the workplace serious et hi cal breach occurred in and employees notified the securities and exchange commission of their concerns
the securities and exchange commission found that some employees had engaged in late market trading which had the effect of favoring some clients over others
ultimately the resolution of the issues comprised several steps including establishing an ombudsman function
leaders enthusiastically embraced the ombudsman concept they understood that the firm would benefit by pro vi ding an informal option to safely raise and discuss troublesome issues
they also concluded that having an ombudsman would drive positive change in the firm as they recognized that there are structural bar rie rs within the formal offices that may prevent ideas and problems from being surfaced
an organizational ombudsman could either resolve matters informally or bring them to the attention of the formal offices at the firm through trend analysis and reporting
as result alliance bern stein set out to create best pr ac tic es ombudsman office
journal of the international ombudsman association the first and one of the most important demons tra ti ons of commitment to the concept began with uni fied support from the leaders
this support be gan at the time the ombudsman concept was agreed upon and continues to this day
the announced the decision to create the program and conveyed the firm wide commitment to this independent in for mal and confidential resource
the introduction to the program was included the online ethics training and information about the ombudsman was broadcast within every business unit and global loca ti on
local and line managers encouraged all employ to avail themselves of the ombudsman option
the charter and pol ic ie sa properly constructed charter is an important component of ombudsman effectiveness it sets the parameters of the office and defines the role of the office to all stake holders internal as well as external
the alliance bern stein charter and the policies for investigation of matters reported to the ombudsman are in the appendix to this article
they were crafted to conform to the securities and exchange commis sion order the american bar association standards and the code of ethics and standards of practice of the international ombudsman association
see the appendix for the complete charter and policies while the charter provides the required framework the ombudsman must then engage each cons ti tu en cy to define how the office can assist them in meeting their goals to develop informal contacts which allow the ombudsman to understand the pressures and opportunities for each constituency and to maintain contact outside of any formal reporting channel or feedback events
set and communicate the expectations the charter and policies provide an important frame work for the office at alliance bern stein
however an ombudsman has to be engaged throughout the entire community in order to be effective
each entity whether college company or nonprofit organization has its own unique culture
an ombudsman must identify and understand the operative community values in order to be effective
consideration of the issue of effectiveness must begin from the moment the office is occupied
in order to measure results of the informal resolution options the ombudsman provides broad and visible agreement of its goals must first be established
critically imp or ta nt topics to cover with the members of the org ani zati on include the scope of the ombudsman service who has ac cess to the what issues may be discussed with the ombudsman are there statutory cultural or other factors which limit informality or the access to institutional when and how matters brought to the ombudsman are to be escalated and investigated in order to be resolved effectiveness can begin to be measured once the parameters of the office services are established and it is vitally important for the ombudsman to engage in thorough and continuous outreach to all potential inquirers and responders to enquiries
this builds understanding of exactly what it means to contact the office and what will ensue once contact is initiated
it also allows for the ombudsman to interact with stake holders outside of an immediate issue and build rapport for the times that an urgent matter may need to be addressed
an ombudsman can be effective only if the com munity is aware of what exactly it is the ombudsman does and how any member of the organization may contact the office
it is imperative that communication about the office be frequent and strongly supported throughout the organization
some of the hallmarks of an effective office are the ability to contact the office anonymously ensuring that information about the office is available in variety of formats and lan gu ages maintaining flexibility in appointment times and treating all those who come into contact with the office respectfully
communication with the office must be strictly private accessible and secure
because the office was new to alliance bern stein it was particularly important for the ombudsman to establish meaningful contact throughout the or ga ni zati on
engagement with all formal and informal levels of the organization was crucial
having met em and leaders prior to the time they might be approached about the trends and burning issues in their domain was invaluable
it provided the opp or tu journal of the international ombudsman to set the groundwork for how the ombudsman would work absent the emotional load of particular issues which might later surface
it also allowed the ombudsman to establish baseline understanding of the goals and successes the issues people were worried about and their outlook for the future
the fact that considerable time was taken to understand the opportunities and challenges perceived was also important in managing expectations
this allowed the ombudsman to learn more about the organization be better prepared to listen carefully and address future issues
numerous meetings demonstrated the com mit ment to be confidential resource for all who are part of the organization
the ways in which the ombudsman reports to an organization is highly significant aspect of ef fec
it is especially important because the office operates informally
yet all leaders and constituents want to understand the nature of issues raised and the resolutions and changes which resulted to ad dress these issues
the alliance bern stein office reports formally once year and two reports are generated
one report is delivered to the executives the audit committee and the independent directors of the mutual fund boards
second report to all employees includes hypothetical case studies illustrating cal issues brought to the office
throughout the year trends are reported as needed while informality and confidentiality are maintained
the pattern of formal and informal reporting contributes to the understand ing of how the office drives changes at the individual group and firm wide levels
measure and publish the results after the parameters of the office are in place mea surement of the effectiveness of outreach and re so lu ti on efforts may begin
number of quantitative measures related to effectiveness may be determined including the percent of the population aware of the office of those who know what issues may be raised and of those who believe it is an independent neutral and informal means to discuss and resolve matters within the organization
such measures as well as the answers to the survey questions may allow fine tun ing of outreach efforts and improve the ability of the ombudsman to hear from the population
an imp or ta nt tool in this process was short online survey
this annual online survey was sent to the entire population
it has the advantage of being easily ac cessible and because it is global survey it does not compromise the anonymity of respondents
it consists of multiple choice and open ended questions eg would you like to tell us
which provided valuable feedback to ombudsman
some potential drawbacks of such survey are that it may not be confidential
while alliance ber ns te in uses third party to collect and compile the responses it may conceivably be possible to identify who participated in the survey and may be subject to responses
the survey must carefully worded and reviewed to avoid biased responses or skewed conclusions
it is useful to collect the opinion of individuals who sought guidance from the office as well as the resp on dents and formal offices that are contacted by the ombudsman
this will provide information to target awareness efforts to underrepresented segments of the population and assess the perceived value of the office on the part of both inquirers and responders
it will allow for feedback to the community about the perceived strengths and weakness of the office and to disclose possible steps to improve ombudsman services
this then provides the foundation for the next incremental adjustments to expectations for the office and for the next assessment of its effectiveness
it will measure which parts of the organization felt that the office gave them information they might not otherwise have been aware of if coaching on difficult issues was provided and whether the ombudsman remained informal impartial and respectful
by targeting survey to those who contacted the office as well as those who responded to requests from the ombudsman one will gain far more robust perspective
properly constructed surveys of the or ga ni zati on can yield information about the om buds effectiveness as well as illuminate areas for the ombudsman to improve
see appendix for sample survey questions since the ombudsman function is by its nature confidential and informal it is continuing challenge to demonstrate its value and effectiveness
most ti ons in an organization are assessed by measuring what they produce
some products of an ombudsman office may be increased harmony strengthening of the formal reporting systems meaningful change in journal of the international ombudsman association practices or policies reduction in grievances filed or an increased commitment to organization
om buds men often speak of the frustration of measuring what did not happen as result of the availability of the in formal and confidential services available through an ombudsman
one must begin by establishing clear definition of the office continuously communicating the goals and limits of the office throughout the or ga ni zati on broadly reporting results and inviting the members of the organization to effectively provide feedback on their experiences with the office
these steps will strengthen the understanding of the effectiveness and will promote an appreciation of its contributions to the organization at every level

litigation prevention conflict resolution risk mi ti ga ti on introduction cost effectiveness is hot issue in the current economy
everyone is tightening their belt and large organizations are certainly no exception
unfortunate ly when it comes to cutting costs some of the most valuable organizational programs lose their funding because it is so difficult to demonstrate direct re la ti on ship between cost and true value
this article presents conceptual approach to value measurement based on the actual experience of one ombudsman in corporate environment
first encountered this measurement dilemma in when was an ombudsman for major corporation
it was time not unlike the present period of downsizing mergers and cost cutting
intuitively we knew how valuable the ombudsman office was but the financial team wanted to see proof and hard data
therefore set out to design way to begin to measure the cost effectiveness of the ombudsman function
journal of the international ombudsman recommend system policy or process improve improve promote cooperation and enhance company image ombudsman contributions in many of these areas create significant value but are difficult to measure directly and therefore difficult to quantify
liti ga ti on prevention was chosen as the singular focus for this study because we believed it had the greatest potential for significant cost savings to the org ani za ti on
it is also an area which allows direct application of verifiable cost information thereby creating credible basis for estimates of value
the ombudsman office frequently saves considerable time and expense by resolving conflict before it escalates to formal and costly dispute resolution processes such as litigation
the challenge presented required devising way to think about such cost avoidance measuring the value of something that happen
this article describes the conceptual thought process used to demonstrate very conservative cost savings estimate for one ombudsman over three year period
specific supporting data while it does exist have been omitted due to the sensitive aspects of this information and the need to honor the confidential nature of the ombudsman role
an additional as sumption was that the cost of one ombudsman sala benefits office space etc
was more than offset by many other savings associated with the topics which were not documented or quantified in this study
fortunately my education provided me with general understanding of the law so had good sense of what cases might escalate to litigation if not resolved
examined cases over three year period and determined how many were litigation sensitive using criteria that could be applied to any ombudsman case
only employment law related cases presenting high risk for litigation were eva lu at ed with two or more of the following criteria required for inclusion in the client raised legal intent to sue articulated by client has means to follow through on limited previous contact with attorney ee oc etc
financial emotional support facts compelling in then determined how many of these litigation sen si cases had been resolved in manner satisfactory to the client
our ombudsman office used the follow ing method to code cases upon clo sur ey yes problem solved and client is ha pp yn no problem not solved or not completely solved but client appreciates efforts made and is not indicating an interest in pursuing further remedies
problem not solved andor client not happy
only cases coded or defined as positive out comes were included in the study
considering employment law related cases which met two or more of the stated criteria and also were coded or now had identified the number of cases to use in developing formula for actual cost avoidance
the next question was how to determine what value to apply to the cases that had been id en ti fied
research regarding the potential cost of em ployment law related litigation revealed myriad of parameters including the type of case filed whether or not it is filed in federal or state court and even which state court whether or not punitive damages can be awarded the odds that case will be settled prior to trial etc
rather than attempt to construct complex mathematical model which takes into consideration all possible outcomes and variables approached the legal department for some assistance with the project
they were able to share with me the average cost of each case they settled not taking into account the possibility of court award to the petitioner
obviously if cases go to trial the risks in terms of possible costs and damage to corporate reputation are not only much greater but also much more difficult to predict
we settled on conservative approach based on actual average costs incurred by the legal department to settle legal claims prior to trial
journal of the international ombudsman association an interesting side note was that the legal depart ment had noticed an upswing in in proper filings containing facts that did not state prima facie legal case
the filings did catalogue personal experiences of strong feelings that the petitioner had not been treated fairly
to the legal department in proper filings indicated that person did not have strong position or lawyer would probably have taken the case
as result of these discussions we agreed that regardless of whether or not someone had articulated legitimate legal issue once demand letter was received andor case was filed the legal department had to respond and defend the corporation
without including sensitive organizational data the conceptual formula for the three year period can be summarized as follows number of employment law related cases resolved by the ombudsman litigation criteria satisfied and case coded or average cost per case if settled by legal department cost avoidance achieved by ombudsman using this formula we were able to substantiate nearly in cost avoidance savings or ap proximately per year over three year period for one ombudsman
using this conceptual approach any ombudsman office would be able to calculate litigation prevention cost savings by filling in the specific data relevant to their own organization
in my experience as an ombudsman often witnessed two critical underlying issues beneath the surface of most concerns often someone had not talked to the employee at all or had communicated ineffectively with them thus creating lack of trust and overall feeling of dissatisfaction with the cor po ration
unhappy people frequently pursue litigation because they feel they have not been heard andor treated fairly
with continued sense of frustration they see no other options available to them
how does the ombudsman address these issues
ob vi helping an employee resolve an issue is the preferred outcome for any case
however there were many times when situation could not be changed but as result of visiting the ombudsman office the employee gained better understanding of their circumstances or communication between them and another was improved
sometimes they felt satisfied with just being listened to being able to explore op ti ons available to them andor knowing that sincere efforts had been made to resolve the presenting matter
under these circumstances the case could be closed with clear understanding even if it was not the complete resolution an employee originally desired
each of these positive outcomes represents significant cost avoidance
because of the confidential nature of the om buds man role it is often difficult to discuss let alone publicize issues brought to the office
therefore organizational decision makers may not understand nor appreciate the pressure relief valve function that an ombudsman provides
although substantial the attendant benefits of this service remain invisible to many
the ombudsman is definitely valuable ti on perhaps even more so during times as difficult as those we encounter now
there are enormous risks inherent in litigation
in addition to potential jury awards including punitive damages legal fees wast ed managerial and administrative time and negative publicity can turn even into financial loss
being successful in marketplace means avoid ing court battles not winning them
organizations would be wise to think carefully before removing or downsizing service that prevents expensive and time consuming litigation in addition to promoting enhanced employee satisfaction and productivity
or ga ni zati ons facing the current economic climate need full engagement of the hearts and minds of every remaining employee
organizational culture om buds cultural change
an culture lies at the essence of its existence
yet there are numerous challenges as so cia ted with examining culture in organizations
the word culture itself is difficult to define and less clear still is what the organizational role if any is in cultural change
in this article the first in series will offer some defi nit ions of culture and then raise questions list chal leng es and suggest principles related to an om buds role in being an agent for cultural change in his or her organization
rather than offering answers hope this article stimulates thought on this important topic
based on feedback from the om buds com mu subsequent articles in this journal will address the subject in detail
culture is probably the most dif fi cult of all organizational concepts to define
hatch in discussing culture in the context of social theory parker et al
in their book social theory basic tool kit attempt definition culture they say is some thing that is transmitted nonbiologically something learned
culture consists of processes and me cha nis ms which enable the past to be carried into the present and it is an influence that has to be applied
culture do our living for us
culture is bittersweet realm of human self deter mi nation
for the purpose of this article would like to narrow the definition of culture to include only how it relates to organizations
number of people have attempted to define organizational culture
journal of the international ombudsman association well enough to be considered valid and therefore to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive think and feel in relation to those problems
lynch offers definition that came from mary ro we one simple and profound definition of culture is that it is people treat each other
and how people treat each other when in conflict is its essence
thus shifting an at ti tu des and practices around conflict can fun da mentally and positively affect the workplace and its culture
number of others have also attempted to define cul tu re
whatever the meaning we can safely say that culture exists
so despite the lack of universally agreed upon definition will pose questions about culture in light of the definitions listed above
questions what follows is beginning list of questions the om buds profession may ask when wrestling with the concept of culture what is what are an cultures
should an organizational om buds be concerned about organizational cultures
if so with respect to what issues or topics
is it ethically and organizationally appropriate for an ombudsman to consciously decide to be an agent of cultural change in his or her organization
are there times when it would be unethical to not try to change the culture or some aspect of it
if an om buds were to help an organization change policy procedure or structure as response to some systemic problem is that kind of change agent work the same as
what would the relationship with the leadership in the organization need to be like for the om buds to consider working in the area of cul tur al change
would all the leaders have to agree that change is needed
if it is appropriate to be an agent of cultural change what actually can an om buds accomplish and under which circumstances
is there evidence that organizational cultures can be changed by conscious action
if so have the circumstances under which change has occurred been studied as well
does an organizational ombudsman naturally have some effect on organizational cultures whether or not by conscious design
how do organizational cultures affect the om buds office and its mission
how do the various cultures within an organization affect different om buds practitioners
do om buds consciously or unc on scious ly adapt to organizational cultures in order to build trust
would the same ombudsman affect two different organizations differently
can an om buds effectiveness be measured in part by its effect on cultures
if so who is to measure that effectiveness
further questions that highlight the challenges of this if an om buds consciously attempted to change some aspect of organizational culture and if we tried to measure the impact of that attempt how would we account for indirect influences that may exist
such influences are nearly impossible to measure
the organizational om buds for example may me mes in the course of his or her inter action with visitors and other stake holders
organizations have number of cultures although one or more of those cultures may predominate
for example many aspects of toward women ethnic subgroups and class differ differ from one department to er
who decides how many cultures an organization has and how they will be defined
journal of the international ombudsman one definition of culture previously mentioned is people treat each other
is it is it only wishful actually change how people treat one another
an organization can constrain behavior and an organization can teach wonderful customer service
does this fund amen tally change how people treat each other
cultures can perhaps always state of flux
external and internal forces act on cul tur es and make it difficult to pinpoint exactly what they are not to speak of understanding the dir ec ti ons they may be going in
changes in leadership substantial successes or defeats with respect to the mission of the organization or external influences like recession may challenge status quo in fundamental ways
how would we account for these sources of influence
who has the right to describe and define an or ga present cultures
who has the right to decide on conscious cultural change
is it beyond an mandate to do either of these tasks
perhaps the most useful question is not whether an om buds will be an agent of cultural change
could it be more question of when with whom under what circumstances and why an om buds becomes such an agent
principles while subsequent articles will elaborate on the details of an possible involvement in cultural change below is starting list of principles an om buds might consider when contemplating cultural conformance with laws and conformance with company the espoused values and the priorities within the compliance with the codes of con duct attempts at addressing culture should be sparked by caseload rather than an personal consideration of appropriate timing it may be equally important for om buds to re exam other principles that are often taken for granted
as an example is the prescription of all do no an essential principle for an om buds who is contemplating cultural change
if the culture does change might that change be costly for some stake holders
culture happens in my mind discussion on an role in cultural change will lead us to ask whether an or ga ni zati on al om buds performing to standards of practice could avoid being an agent of cultural transformation
would suggest that the nature of the work impacts an org ani za cultures even if the om buds simply sits in his or her office waiting for visitors to arrive
neutrality independence informality and confidentiality have an unavoidable impact on an organization
and how much more so if the om buds actively promotes the activities of the office regularly offers upward feedback provides informative annual reports and intentionally works together with others as change agent to address various problems
further by enlisting abovementioned de fini ti on which connects culture with how people deal with one another during conflict it can be argued that since an om buds deals with conflicts on regular basis again he or she cannot avoid meeting the cul tur es of the organization he or she is serving
some thing is going to happen
by raising the above ques ti ons and taking first look at guiding principles hope to spark some discussion about culture and cul tur es
om buds may want to help their organizations develop cultures that could benefit stake holders
how that should be done is topic requiring further thought

zati on training introduction conflict coaching is one on one process to develop conflict understanding interaction strategies andor interaction skills
conflict coaching deserves consideration within the om buds field as om buds routinely support individual visitors in making sense of their situations as well as identifying and possibly enacting appropriate and effective options
in writing this article draw on ex peri en ce as conflict coaching training development specialist with om buds and others as well as my role as communication scholar
while this article largely focuses on the use of the comprehensive conflict coaching model cc cm jones model that have been involved in hope through that example to show the relevance of conflict coaching in general in the work of organizational om buds
it starts with some background on formal conflict coaching and then overviews the cc cm
the remainder of the article ad dresses conflict coaching acknowledges that informal conflict coaching has been used by om buds for some time shares an om buds coach case example explores areas of close fit between conflict coaching and organizational om buds work points out limitations and identifies some opportunities for further adv anc ing the om buds and conflict coaching intersection in terms of theory research and practice
background on formal conflict coaching conflict coaching has its most explicit roots in the dispute resolution and executive coaching fields
one on one conflict process first developed in the dispute resolution field in order to provide assistance in cases in which one or both parties did not want to pursue mediation tid well
journal of the international ombudsman association leadership competency that an executive coach may address kil burg
in organizational set tings conflict coaching can be used to support any individual in working through conflict
it may also be used pro actively in order to transition new mem be rs into the organization develop future leaders or assist virtually any individual in preparing to handle potentially sensitive issues
conflict coach models such as the one explored here have been shared with dispute resolution professionals working in higher education dispute resolution professionals and managers in the united states government hospital based nursing leadership and om buds working in corporate education government and healthcare settings
these other models include the conflict cation resource team approach at temple university that involves coaching individuals on different conflict communication modules and the approach of noble that involves the use of carefully crafted questions to assist individuals in self determining next steps
the comprehensive conflict coaching model the cc cm incorporates prominent conflict related literature from across disciplines can be applied in wide variety of situations and is designed to integrate with organizational dispute systems
the cc cm assumes that conflict is primarily comm uni ca ti on based fol ger jones
it also assumes combined systems and social constructionist ger gen foundation the latter especially as humans are seen making sense and planning action using narra wins lade monk dalton
the cc cm also rests on number of more practice oriented assumptions
while it is intended to be flexible eg movement among stages time devoted to the process types of conflicts to which it can be applied and adaptation to range of organizational settings the model is certainly not appropriate as the main mode of intervention for all cases eg address ing serious policy andor legal violations
before coach uses the model he or she should be clear about obligations to both the direct client the individual receiving coaching services and any indirect clients other individuals offices or organizations who may be arranging hosting andor paying for the coaching service
the cc cm is intended to be used by coaches with strong knowledge and skill base in conflict management so that they can work in both tat ive manner primary and an expert secondary manner
facilitative approach is meant to emphasize the use of questions for the client to consider and highlights the use of appreciative inquiry cooper rider whitney for the client to develop future plans
an expert approach acknowledges that it is sometimes appropriate and effective for the coach to share conflict communication research and theory insights andor organizational dispute system insights for the client to consider in selecting how to under stand his or her situation andor possibly take action
in addition the client remains in control of whether or not to apply any coach expertise that may have been shared
it is never appropriate for the coach to force particular course of action on the client
the cc cm is body of knowledge related skills and an overall framework that trained coach can use with client or in the case of an om buds coach used with visitor client
the model includes an initial conversation four typically consecutive stages and parallel process
the preparatory conversation includes clarifying the coaching process determining client process fit determining coach client fit and deciding whether to commit
stage discovering the story involves establishing the initial story
stage exploring perspectives consists of using the topics of identity emotion and power three major themes in conflict development and intervention to gain more insight into the conflict for self and other
stage crafting the best story invites the client to generate desired vision of what he or she wants to have happen given the exploration that has already occurred
stage enacting the best story is an opportunity for the client to consider skills or resource options for making the best story lived reality in interaction with others
the parallel process learning assessment includes the top of client needs assessment goal setting reflection and feedback and learning transfer that are intended to be addressed throughout the coaching relationship
journal of the international ombudsman association the om buds informal use of conflict coaching casey provided thorough review of the history and development of the om buds field that is drawn upon here in acknowledging how informal conflict coaching has likely been notable part of the work of some om buds since at least the
classic om buds work dates back to the th century stacey and consists of an independent office charged with helping citizens maneuver through government bureaucracy and obtain protection from govern ment injustice
beginning in the the om buds field experienced surge of growth with the devel op ment of the organizational om buds hill
these om buds were put in place by management to handle the conflicts of those internal and external to the organization particularly the large organization
forces promoting the rise of om buds functions in cl ud ed employee relations legislation the anticipated financial benefits of reducing workplace conflict and the development of alternative dispute resolution
gad lin pointed out that many issues brought to organizational om buds were partially interpersonal or relational in nature and ac cording ly these offices provided relatively less formal means for addressing conflicts
gad lin added that organizational om buds were often more involved with working with visitors to clarify conflict dynamics rather than determining facts and making formal judgment as is the tendency with classic om buds
ko lb earlier found even when focusing solely on organizational om buds some were relatively tra dition al fact finders while others could be described as helpers
both of these approaches can be seen to have notable overlaps with conflict coaching with the helper approach arguably more related to it
the factfinder can be seen to use informal conflict coaching in moving from basic explanation of the om buds ti on to hearing the basic situation to explain ing applicable organizational policies and procedures including options available to the visitor
the helper can be seen to use informal conflict coaching in work ing with the visitor to consider his or her situation from multiple points of view and explore and possibly adopt an informal approach to addressing conflicts
more recent work by harrison addressed an other om buds contrast the design of om buds offices as facilitating justice or harmony
for harrison there was fairly sharp distinction between the justice orientation of determining truth and assigning blame versus the harmony orientation of smoothing re la ti on ships and minimizing blame
each of these tat ions was not depicted as inherently right or wrong
rather selection ideally represented the goals of the organizational context in which given om buds office is embedded since research demonstrated that justice and harmony could not be simultaneously achieved to high degree
in this framework conflict coaching seems considerably more in line with harmony approach as conflict coaching holds open the possibility of the client adopting new inter pre frames generally considering positive dialog and directly interacting with other conflict parties in constructive manner either through mediation or unmediated conversation
from per spec most university om buds offices were not op er ating from the harmony orientation and yet greater use of this orientation was conceivable given the understanding that om buds are agents of org ani zati on al change wagner
work arguably supports additional consideration of conflict coaching within the om buds field given his suggestions that om buds consider more one on one pre mediation support find ways to intervene earlier in the development of conflicts engage disputants regarding power and emotion dynamics promote dis put ant perspective taking and generally operate with more awareness of their organizational system
om buds work is closely connected to alternative dis pu te resolution casey as is conflict coaching
even considering the diversity of om buds practice gad lin conflict coaching has important com mona li ties with much of the om buds field
om buds and conflict coaching case study the short case and accompanying description see below case study demonstrate how the work of an om buds can incorporate the comprehensive conflict coaching model
note that while this exam shows an om buds broadly adopting the cc cm by using it to structure the entire om buds conversation it is also conceivable that the cc cm could be used more narrowly by bounding conflict coaching within the larger om buds and visitor interaction
journal of the international ombudsman association connections to the cc cm preparatory conversation the om buds coach and visitor clarify role and process limits as well as visitor commitment before actually starting with content concerns
stage discovering the story the om buds coach elicits the initial story to promote the own processing of the situation and provide the om buds coach with the basic detail needed to begin to be helpful
stage exploring perspectives the om buds coach invites refl ec ti on on identity emotion and power themes for self and other so that the visitor and om buds coach get fuller understanding of the situation and what might need to be taken into account for po si outcome to be achieved
case study the initial meeting between the om buds and student visitor began with the om buds explaining her basic function and the student acknow le dg ing that he understood and wanted to go ahead with the meeting
the student began sharing his current situation
the student sought out the om buds because he had initially received good grades on series of assignments that cumulatively consisted of one third of his final course grade but then the instructor ran the assignments through plagiarism database and found that much of the work had appeared in prior work
the instructor consequently deducted from the initial grades on these assignments
number of other students in the class received similar such penalties
the student did not think it was fair that whole series of his grades could be changed after they were issued
the student also did not think it was fair to make claim of plagiarism given that the two or three page papers were so short and accordingly arguments had to be so compact virtually ensuring that that much of the content consisted of purely factual information or basic opinion that had appeared elsewhere
furthermore the student felt that he had been wronged since no single complete sentence that he had written had appeared in any single prior source
the om buds inquired further into how the student made sense of his role or roles in this situation how he felt about the situation as well as what power he felt he had and how he was thinking about possibly taking or not taking action
she also asked him to consider these same issues from the perspective
basically he felt angry and even outraged that as serious and fairly strong student and an honest person he ended up in this situation
he knew that he could complain to the depart ment chairperson but was worried that this person would simply take the side of the instructor
he added that he could talk to his advisor full pro fess or in the college and someone with whom he felt pretty comfortable but he was not sure what this person had the power to do
he speculated that his instructor thought he was doing the right thing as teacher but that the instructor probably fully understand how the plagiarism software worked
because the instructor probably felt both confident in his initial position and under attack from multiple students the student assumed that the instructor would stand his ground
journal of the international ombudsman association the om buds then asked the student to consider his ideal outcome in the situation
the student expressed that he wanted to resolve the issue with his instructor and maintain civil relationship with him
he also wanted to get good grade in the course and graduate with strong overall grade point average so that he was able to gain entry into highly ranked and competitive graduate program
the om buds felt compelled at this point to clarify some policy and procedural assumptions that the student seemed to have made in their conversation thus far
according to university policy there was no stat ute of limitations on charges of plagiarism and therefore it was in the purview to make charge of plagiarism after the papers had been marked and returned to the student
regarding the issue of wh eth er it was possible to be guilty of plagiarism even if no intact unattributed sentence could be found the om buds indicated that such claim of plagiarism might still be justified as is sometimes found with instances of patchwork plagiarism
however even though the instructor had the authority to charge plagiarism in this case he did not hold the authority to penalize the student to any degree without submitting formal pa per work to the university senate and triggering formal notification to the student including clarification of formal appeal process
therefore given the facts of the case as shared by the student the instructor in this respect made breach but not uncorrectable breach of university policy
finally plagiarism charges were handled on case by case basis and it did not matter at least for the formal challenge process whether others might also be formally charged for similar alleged offenses
the om buds noted some major opportunities available to the student at this juncture in their conversation
one option was to spend additional time clarifying university policy and procedure concerning plagiarism allegations between an instructor and student
second option was to discuss the possibility for the om buds to directly intervene with the instructor
third option was to explore other third party dispute re so lu ti on options available inside and outside the university including media ti on
fourth option was to explore the viability of the student directly interacting with the instructor regarding the issue and possibly preparing the student for specific student instructor conversation
the om buds also expressed willingness to consider other options as well including the possible decisions to prepare to speak to his advisor or to simply end the om buds visit with the insights gleaned thus far
stage crafting the best story the om buds coach invites the visitor to articulate desired outcome given all of the previous exploration
stage enacting the best story the move to clar policy and procedural as sump ti ons is not required in this stage however it is generally accounted for given the understanding that the conflict coach will sometimes speak in an expert as opposed to facilitative voice
alternatively the om buds coach could have shared these insights earlier in the conversation
stage enacting the best story cont the statement about the possible next steps is more standard example of what would be covered at the beginning of stage con versa ti on al segment
presumably the om buds coach and client would go on to develop the directional choice
journal of the international ombudsman assoc ia ti ona close fit between om buds work and conflict coaching there are some specific aspects of om buds work and conflict coaching that are very closely aligned
because conflict coaching is one on one client can freely out loud
this level of informality is one of the hallmarks and perhaps one of the key visitor and organizational benefits of an om buds process especially that visitors do not put the organization on record
an additional benefit of both processes is that most working in these areas would agree that conflict matters are often best handled at the lowest pos sib le level
using conflict coaching approaches the om buds coach can assist in developing the knowledge and skills so that this person can appropriately and effectively take action on their own or consider the use of other processes and resources that empower the visitor through high degree of direct involvement
conflict coaching is desirable for many om buds as they frequently find that only one party in dyad seeks conflict assistance andor as om buds seek sound basic structure for virtually all visitor meetings
finally conflict coaching may be appealing as om buds look for knowledge skills and frameworks that allow them to be more proactive with visitors
limitations of combining conflict coaching and om buds work there are certainly some hard limits and areas of sensitivity for om buds who are considering blend ing their work with conflict coaching
my experience co training large group of om buds at recent conference indicated that while most in the embrace an organizational om buds model some em brace an advocacy philosophy or incorporate discrete instances of advocacy practice with visitors
just as clarity regarding neutrality and advocacy is important for those working as om buds so it is important for those working as conflict coaches
given that conflict coaching in part arranges conflict communication knowledge and skills so that it can be shared with visitor clients om buds coaches need to make sure that they are adequately familiar with this material
conflict coaching is most likely less relevant to classic om buds as well as organizational om buds working from fact finding ko lb orientation
also it is most likely less applicable to issues that are pre do mi nant ly concerned with policy and procedure rather than communication considerations
finally ad op ti on of conflict coaching by om buds should proceed with care so that documented lack of clarity about the office harrison is ameliorated rather than intensified
some priorities for advancing theory research and practice in this area this article is primarily intended as mod est addition to other work from communication standpoint harrison that seeks to examine and develop the om buds field
in terms of advancing conflict coaching among om buds the following suggestions represent partial list
theory more can be done to elaborate the theo re tical fit and possible tensions between models of organizational om buds work and models of conflict coaching
research first and foremost the effectiveness needs to be investigated bearing in mind that success in the om buds process is difficult to determine and requires additional inquiry harrison
also it would be valuable to investigate how om buds who are trained in the in conflict coaching apply it if at all in their work and to document larger organizational implications when conflict coaching is formally adopted either within the om buds function or elsewhere
practice upon determining the best practices of om buds who use conflict coaching it would be helpful to in turn to share these with others in the field
conclusion the general description of working one on one with party in conflict to develop conflict understanding strategies and skills clearly applies to the work of om buds as well as conflict coaches
the proposal and continued development of conflict coaching is therefore relevant to the om buds com munity
conflict coaching may informally influence the practice of om buds or be more systematically journal of the international ombudsman association introduced
whether it has any impact at all on the work of om buds and visitors it provides an interest ing new lens through which to consider the om buds role
more ambitiously the intersection of conflict coaching and om buds work may be intriguing and valuable both for how the om buds field can possibly develop through exposure to the larger com mu and for how the om buds field can contribute to the growth of effective conflict management beyond its own bounds
most importantly it may offer visitors and organizations an enhanced means of managing conflict

introduction organizational om buds work within org ani za ti ons to facilitate the resolution of complaints
in order to perform their duties they claim legal ex emption or privilege from the requirement to disclose confidential information as evidence in court pro cee dings similar to privileges extended to attorney client spousal and priest penitent relationships
this paper argues that legislatures should enact sta tu tory privilege and provides preliminary outline of what this legislation should contain
the role of the organizational om buds perhaps no profession is more misunderstood than the organizational om buds
in addition to the strange name this confusion results from significant differences between organizational om buds and the classical om buds from which they have evolved
most classical om buds are employed by governments to address complaints primarily from the public
in contrast organizational om buds work inside or ga ni zati ons often large corporations or universities to address complaints raised primarily by internal constituents such as employees or students
these internal constituents are inherently more vulnerable because unlike members of the public their rep uta ti on relationships and status within the org ani za ti on may suffer as result of the process
due to the greater vulnerability of internal constituents or ga ni zati on al om buds use different mechanisms from classical om buds for solving problems
they do not conduct formal investigations but rather rely on in for mal methods
journal of the international ombudsman assoc ia ti ona typical case begins when complainant contacts the om buds office with problem or question
the organizational om buds will meet with complain ant privately
the om buds listens to the complainant helps the complainant articulate goals and interests and explores various options for seeking resolution
the om buds avoids recommending any particular action but rather assists the complainant in eva lu at ing options and making an informed choice
based on what the complainant chooses to do the om buds may seek information refer the complainant to other resources coach the complainant in how to address the problem directly engage in shuttle diplomacy conduct mediation session or take some other ac ti on
some but not all cases involve dispute re so lu ti on
since organizational om buds rely on the initiative of complainants and the cooperation of management their ability to function depends on their reputation as trustworthy and ethical professionals
consequent ly organizational om buds adhere to strict frame work of ethical principles
understanding this ethical framework is critical to understanding the role of the om buds and the need for privilege
the international ombudsman association defines four pillars of an organizational ethical framework confidentiality neutrality independence and informality
confidentiality confidentiality the commitment of the om buds not to disclose is central to the role
most other management sponsored dispute resolution me cha nis ms lack true confidentially
once complaint has been made the organization is officially on notice
complainants have lost control and run the risk that response will exacerbate the problem
consequently complainants may choose not to use these formal channels or may wait allowing minor conflict to escalate into far more damaging crisis
om buds by contrast do not treat disclosures as formal complaints and maintain confidentiality as they assist complainants in evaluating their options or coaching them in dispute resolution skills
om buds may engage in informal shuttle diplomacy or media ti on but only with permission from the complain ant and other parties involved
furthermore while om buds may issue reports to management that can then be used by management to address structural concerns and patterns these reports must contain only anonymous aggregate or representative in forma ti on
om buds keep no records containing identifying information
the concepts of confidentiality and privilege though distinct are related and often confused
conf id en ti ality is the commitment not to voluntarily disclose information without permission
privilege is legal exemption from the requirement to disclose con fi den ti al information as evidence in formal procedure such as courtroom trial or administrative hearing
the standards assert privilege as part of the confidentiality standards
this privilege belongs to the om buds office and it cannot be waived by other parties
neutrality neutrality or impartiality requires that om buds offices remain unaligned in every dispute
impartial frees parties to engage the process without con cern that the om buds will take sides
om buds are also discouraged from taking on additional roles within the organization that might compromise their actual or perceived neutrality
when an om buds is forced to provide evidence in an adversarial process that will inevitably assist one side over another the neutrality of the om buds is under mined
the om buds will be perceived as taking sides and thus privilege is an important means of main tain ing neutrality
independence independence is closely related to impartiality
om buds are charged by the organization to remain neutral and yet are inherently vulnerable to coercion from the organization itself because the organization controls the employment and budget
thus the om buds office must be granted high degree of independence so that it will not be coopted by other functions of the organization
best practices require that om buds offices report directly to the highest levels of the organization
an independence can be threatened when forced to provide evidence in an adversarial process
the om buds may appear too closely affiliated with the organization if the evidence is sought by the journal of the international ombudsman association organization or if the evidence supports the org ani za ti on
if the om buds provides evidence that hurts the organization the organization may be tempted to limit the future independence
privilege protects the independence by circumvent ing these threats
informality organizational om buds do not make deter mina ti ons and do not participate in any formal processes involving investigations adjudications or com pli an ce
the om buds process supplements but does not replace other formal processes
this commit ment to informality represents significant departure from the classical om buds model that emanates from concern that formal processes threaten confidential neutrality and independence when complainants are internal constituents of the organization
informality has an obvious relationship to privilege
without privilege om buds cannot entirely avoid participation in formal processes
om buds can avoid participation in formal proceedings sponsored by the organization but not those adjudicated by the state
unfortunately conflicts requiring state intervention tend to be adversarial drawn out and public
these are precisely the type of formal proceedings that have the greatest potential to tarnish the rep uta ti on
the foundation for establishing privilege though organizational om buds assert lege in order to maintain ethical standards of practice courts are hesitant to grant privileges
the gen eral rule is that court is entitled to every evidence
thus there is presumption against privilege and there must be compelling reason for granting one
to determine privilege federal courts have embraced test articulated by john henry wig more in his famed treatise on evidence
while the wig more test is not binding on the legislature it provides useful framework for analysis of the om buds privilege
the wig more test requires that the communication must be one made in the belief that it will not be disclosed confidentiality must be essential to the maintenance of the relationship be tween the parties the relationship should be one that society considers worthy of being fostered and the injury to the relationship incurred by disclosure must be greater than the benefit gained in the correct disposal of the litigation
these factors are met when applied to the ethical practice requirements of org ani zati on al om buds
confidentiality is the hallmark of the om buds process and the reason many complainants choose the om buds office instead of initiating formal action
however some have argued that the need for con fi den ti ality does not rise to the level of requiring lege
in carman mc don nell douglas corp
the court distinguished between confidentiality and privilege on the basis that users of om buds services expect confidentiality but generally are not anticipating litigation when they communicate with the om buds
this reasoning has two faulty assumptions
the first is the assertion that parties do not anticipate litigation
organizations know that internal conflicts produce litigation
they employ attorneys and estab lish budgets to support their work
in fact pre do mi nant reason for establishing an om buds office is the reduction of litigation expenses
if complainants are sufficiently frustrated to seek out assistance from stranger the potential for litigation has likely crossed their mind
furthermore one of the primary functions of the om buds is to assist complainants in weighing various methods of resolving disputes including legal options
the potential for litigation is the backdrop to the om buds process
the second faulty assumption is that parties dist in gu ish between confidentiality and privilege
when parties are informed that communication is conf id en ti al they may expect nondisclosure under all circum stances whether or not they anticipate litigation
confidentiality is central attribute of the om buds program and precisely what distinguishes it from formal dispute resolution processes
but some most prominently the carman court have argued that privilege is unnecessary because confidentiality journal of the international ombudsman association is sufficient to assure the participation of complain ants and the continued operation of om buds offices without privilege would seem to reinforce this ar gu ment
however the ongoing participation of parties in om buds programs can also be explained by an uncertain presumption of privilege
while there is currently no certain privilege there is also currently no certain absence of privilege
instead an uncertain privilege exists because parties do not distinguish between confidentiality and privilege om buds maintain colorable legal claim to privilege and om buds are not called upon to produce evidence frequently enough to draw attention to the matter
if confidentiality without privilege is truly sufficient then om buds offices would not be impaired by change in circum stance that results in certain and widely recognized absence of privilege
otherwise the om buds ability to function currently rests in precarious state
privilege cannot be separated from confidentiality and the other ethical principles because forcing the om buds to testify publically undermines the ethical structure of the om buds office
the ability to maintain confidentiality in future complaints is chal leng ed
neutrality and informality are also com pro mis ed when om buds are forced to provide evidence in formal adversarial process that will inevitably assist one side over another
independence is threat ened regardless of whether the evidence helps or harms the organization as the om buds office either may be perceived as too closely affiliated with the organization or may find the organization limiting its future independence
the precarious nature of the privilege puts om buds in an ethical bind about how to counsel parties regard ing confidentiality
perhaps they should issue buds privilege warnings eg will not vol un tari ly share confidential information but in the case of litigation may be required to divulge anything you communicate to me
such warnings create further ethical questions
are om buds liable for malpractice if they do not issue such warnings
related question is what level of warning is appropriate
an understated warning could fail to provide sufficient notice but an overstated warning chills communications
the om buds is torn between the competing interests of informing the party eliciting information and avoid ing liability
the only other option is for the om buds to commit not to disclose regardless of the circumstances
the om buds then faces the possibility of being held in contempt out of commitment to ethical practice
negative outcomes of conflict include sickness stress turnover distrust apathy loss of productivity and litigation
these outcomes are not limited to the individuals in conflict but create ripple effect impacting the organization itself and the broader society
the outcomes tend to be gradual pervasive and difficult to measure in quantitative terms but one survey estimates that the average american worker spends hours per week addressing conflict
by reducing workplace conflict and the ripple effect of negative outcomes om buds benefit complainants organizations and society at large
by confidentially assisting parties solve prob le ms and making referrals om buds deliver societal benefits even in circumstances where there is no explicit conflict
for instance om buds deliver societal benefits when they refer employees to employee as si stance programs
the carman decision questioned whether om buds actually deliver the societal benefits they promise
there are three answers to this concern
first system of ensuring effectiveness is already built into the design of the om buds program because om buds programs will survive only if both the org ani zati on and complainants continue to perceive benefit
essentially each party has veto on the program
the organization can veto by ceasing to fund the pro gram
the veto comes in the form of usage control since the program is voluntary
second requiring om buds to prove their effectiveness before granting them privilege is circular because it assumes that effectiveness is not dependent upon an expectation of privilege
finally evidence of effectiveness is available
despite the difficulty of identifying tracking and quantifying benefits which by their nature are spread throughout and beyond the organization om buds have con ducted conservative cost effective assessments that consider only the most easily identifiable financial saving to the organization
results range from sol idly covering the cost of the om buds office to saving nine and half times the cost of the office
balance of harm and benefit granting privilege has implications
the most obvious concern is the potential loss of important evidence
another concern is the potential that privilege could provide cover for management wrongdoing
the loss of evidence is minimal the quality of evidence lost by granting org ani za ti on al om buds privilege is minimal
the om buds process is optional informal and produces no specific records or findings
in other words the locus of the conflict exists elsewhere within the organization and the conflict should follow better documented formal dispute resolution channels before escalating to the point where the state becomes involved
con se quent ly the evidence of the om buds should provide little additional value to evidence available elsewhere within the organization
furthermore any relevant evidence available from the om buds office was likely provided under an expectation of nondisclosure
to compel such evidence is to destroy the grounds upon which it exists
in exceptional circumstances such as threat of imminent harm an overriding concern outweighs the expectation of confidentiality
such exceptions already exist for the general duty of con fid en ti ality
they have less relevance to privilege because evidentiary hearings usually take place long after the threat has passed
nonetheless ex cep ti ons can be specifically identified and applied to the om buds privilege just as they are in other privileged relationships
ethical practice is the best protection against bias perhaps the greatest resistance from courts to grant ing om buds privilege is the concern that they will shield inappropriate organizational influence on the om buds from the scrutiny of the courts
this is predominantly an issue of the inde pen den ce but it also involves broader concerns about the ethical integrity of the om buds program design given that organizations design the programs employ the om buds and thus exert asymmetrical power
small number of organizations may try to gain an unfair advantage over their employees by deliberately appointing an om buds who will show partiality to the interests of the organization
other dispute re so lu ti on processes most notably arbitration have been similarly abused
privilege would not only shield these programs from scrutiny but could their creation
of perhaps even greater concern is the possibility that organizations will implement om buds programs that are well intended but poorly designed lacking adequate safeguards to assure the independence confidentiality impartiality and in for
such an outcome appears not unlikely given the nature of the om buds field namely its history of innovation and evolution its multiple definitions and the widespread public ignorance of the field
as practical matter perfect om buds independence is impossible as long as the organization is financially responsible for the program and has the ability to terminate the om buds
how ever adherence to independent professional codes of behavior such as those published by the provides om buds sufficient independence to maintain con fid en ti ality and neutrality
these practices include shielding the om buds from reporting relationships within the operational management hierarchy im pos ing limitations on the organizations ability to inter fere with the staffing and budgeting of the om buds office and providing om buds with independent legal counsel
under such safeguards direct employment of an om buds counter intuitively provides greater assurance of independence than hiring an outside contractor
the organization can influence an external contractor by quietly shifting work to competitor on pretext whereas taking disciplinary action against its own internal om buds will have much higher visibility and cost
consequently outside contractors will feel greater systemic pressure to inappropriately favor the interests of the organization
by adhering to standards om buds remain within the established boundaries of ethical practice and organizations avoid the danger of creating process with the name but without its protections
within the confines of the standards the or ga ni zati on al om buds potential for causing irreparable harm is relatively low as compared to other forms of dispute resolution
under standards the use of an om buds is voluntary om buds do not participate in formal proceedings and om buds do not make or impose decisions
arbitration by contrast is binding and obstructs access to the judicial system
in other words the greatest danger for abuse lies in imposter journal of the international ombudsman association processes masquerading as processes and not in the om buds process itself
adhering to ethical standards addresses this imposter threat
in summary the application and enforcement of professional standards is the best way to ensure that evidentiary do not compromise the benefits of the om buds program and that org ani zati on al management does not exert undue influence
the current state of privilege for organizational om buds there are three possible foundations for an om buds privilege statute common law and constitution
in some jurisdictions om buds may also qualify for privilege
statutory privilege currently no legislature state or federal has en acted statutory privilege for organizational om buds although several legislatures have approved leges for classical om buds appointed to serve those legislatures
common law privilege the precedent for an om buds privilege under common law is sparse inconsistent and uncertain
federal law does allow for the existence of common law privileges but some states have enacted statutory provisions explicitly precluding all common law leges
in mc don nell douglas the federal court for the eastern district of missouri applied the traditional test for privilege the wig more factors to the mc don nell douglas om buds program
finding that each of the factors was present the court deter mined that an om buds privilege existed
however six years later in carman the eighth circuit court of appeals determined that the same mc don nell douglas program involving the same om buds of failed to present sufficient evidence to establish privilege
how much of the om buds common law privilege remains after carman is open to debate
the carman decision includes language suggesting that an om buds privilege might never be justified
indeed several unpublished opinions cite carman to state flatly that there is no om buds privilege
er the language criticizing the om buds privilege per se does not appear to be the basis of the sion making it dicta or mere opinion without prec eden ti al authority
instead the carman court based its denial of privilege to the mc don nell douglas om buds on the basis that mc don nell douglas failed to present adequate evidence
this reasoning leaves open the possibility that some other om buds pro gram could theoretically present sufficient evidence to achieve the privilege but what would qualify as sufficient is unclear
constitutional privilege there is no om buds privilege included in the federal constitution
however states each have their own constitutions
in gars tang superior court the california court of appeals found qualified om buds privilege applied under right to privacy guaranteed under the california constitution
however the holding of privilege under gars tang can be read very narrowly
first the privilege is qualified and thus does not apply if the confidential information sought is relevant to and is compelling public for discovery that outweighs the privacy interest
second gars tang precedes car man
though carman is not binding on gars tang it nonetheless casts shadow over the om buds lege
finally the communications took place during mediation conducted by the om buds
the om buds would have qualified for privilege except that she had failed to obtain the informed written consent of the parties to the privilege statutory requirement that had been eliminated by the time the appeals court heard the case
thus one read ing is that gars tang was simply narrow fix to grant the om buds the privilege she would have been entitled to under the updated statutory require ment sd privilege courts might determine that om buds ac ti vi ties qualify for privilege depending on how broadly that mediation privilege is defined
this option was not available in gars tang because of the written consent requirement but might be available now that this requirement has been eliminated in california
but this theory has not been tested and courts may distinguish between mediators and om buds
journal of the international ombudsman association in sum the current status of the om buds privilege is unclear and precarious
organizational om buds have various legal grounds on which to assert privilege but none of them is certain or uni versa lv the need for legislative action to establish an om buds privilege for the reasons listed below the best solution to this current instability is legislative action to establish an om buds privilege based on consistent application of ethical standards
some jurisdictions do not allow privileges to be established through common law
legislation addresses the problem pro actively and uniformly within jurisdiction
the legislative process allows the need for and scope of privilege to be thoroughly investigated
courts address only the dispute at hand and may be susceptible to general misconceptions about or ga ni zati on al om buds
the question of an om buds privilege is usually peripheral question of den ce to which an legal department may be disinclined to commit significant resources
legislative action can bring predictability and sta to field marked by judicial inconsistency
uniformity predictability and the endorsement reinforce the benefits of om buds programs and will encourage their use
by making the privilege contingent on ethical pr ac tice the legislature can reinforce ethical behavior
clear statutory standard would reduce the costly evidence production required to establish privilege on case by case basis de novo at each trial and on appeal and according to an uncertain standard
constructing privilege any om buds privilege will need to be carefully drafted ideally by committee involving om buds experts along with other interested parties in order to create robust statute representing broad cons ti tu ency
the drafters should address the following questions to whom does the privilege belong
what conditions should exist to trigger the privilege
ownership of the priv il eg ea bifurcated holder privilege recommended by alan ki rt ley for mediators best serves the interests of all the parties and the om buds
under bifurcated holder privilege privileges would be held by each of the parties themselves and by the om buds
privilege as to evidence sought from om buds would be waived only with the agreement of all the parties present and the om buds
privilege as to evidence sought from parties would be waived only with the agreement of all the parties but would not require the agree ment of the om buds
this configuration protects the om buds from being compelled to provide evidence which can compromise the perception of the ongoing neutrality and confidentiality with future complainants but makes evidence from parties about the om buds process available where there is un ani mou sly agreement among the parties
the privilege should be contingent on ethical practice
the test for ethical practice should be relatively straightforward determination by courts that avoids both disclosure of the matter the privilege is intended to protect and the current costly fact intensive showing of evidence
the court should grant the om buds rebuttable presumption of privilege if the program can be shown to conform to established general standards of et hi cal practice
the legislature should provide specific parameters as to what constitutes evidence of ethical practice to ensure consistent application
careful thought should be given to how much discretion courts should be granted to consider factors beyond these parameters
broader discretion would allow for greater flexibility under changing circumstances but could also generate inconsistent results
the evidence parameters could be framed in terms of credentials principles andor standards
credential based evidence would include an om buds charter defining standards of practice for that program the conformity with industry standards and journal of the international ombudsman association certification or accreditation by reputable om buds association
principle based evidence would show that the standards sufficiently protect the principles of independence neutrality confidentiality and informality
standard based evidence would es tab lish the adherence to specific standards for example the locus of the om buds office outside the operational management hierarchy or abstention from formal investigations
greater emphasis on cre den ti al based evidence provides flexibility by relying upon the standards maintained by associations such as the and american bar association whereas emphasis upon standard based evidence provides specificity by mandating standards by statute
once the om buds establishes presumption of lege the party challenging the privilege should have an opportunity to rebut the presumption but only by presenting substantial evidence that the om buds program has violated its ethical standards of practice either generally or in the relevant circumstances
such evidence would be presented in camera or in private to preserve the integrity of the privilege
exceptions there are two categories of communications to which the statutory privilege should not apply
the first are communications that fall outside the de fini ti on of privileged communications
the second are communications that would otherwise qualify as privileged communications but are given an explicit exception
outside the definition the privilege would apply only to confidential com munic at ions between om buds and other parties
examples of communications that fail to meet this definition inc lud ea
communications with an om buds operating out side the core om buds role
an example might be performance reviews issued by an om buds in the role of supervisor of office staff
annual reports to the organization containing no identifying information
explicit exceptions explicit exceptions may either be enumerated cif ic ally or defined loosely under circumstances of injustice
in drafting the uniform mediation act mediators strongly resisted the alternative concerned that it could become the exception that swallows the rule fearing that courts would use it as convenient excuse to admit evidence
such concerns are even greater with the om buds process because courts are less familiar with it and have not granted it the favored status of media ti on
enumerated exceptions that should be considered and debated include
parties and the om buds could explicitly contract out of privilege in advance
information covered by an open records act
threats to inflict bodily injury or commit crime of violence
evidence of felony personally witnessed by om buds staff
communications used in malpractice or disc ipl in ary claim against the om buds
om buds should be given the same opportunity as attorneys to defend themselves
also precautions should be taken to prevent parties from tacking on frivolous mal practice charge against the om buds to their claims as an end run around the privilege statute
conclusion organizational om buds deliver significant benefits to organizations complainants and society at large by providing confidential and informal mechanism to resolve disputes quickly and in ex pen
however realization of these benefits depends upon the necessary trust and cooperation of the parties which is maintained by confidentiality and ethical practice
without robust privilege to ensure confidentiality the profession relies upon the fragile and inconsistent protection of the court
every state legislature should act to protect the benefits om buds deliver by establishing statutory privilege contin gent on ethical practice

journal of the international ombudsman association many organizational om buds are wary of attorneys litigators in particular and it is easy to understand why
attorneys may be the antithesis of om buds they are zealous advocates who seem most comfort able working in formal conflict system
mistrust of attorneys deepened when the american bar association aba published its white paper on for the establishment and operation of om buds offices which seemed to tell om buds how to do their jobs
for their part many attorneys especially cor po rate counsel view om buds with equal skepticism
om buds work is poorly defined in the law and yet can have significant impact on an liabilities
moreover attorneys are often hard pressed to fit om buds into the complex legal framework applying to large organization
for these reasons om buds might be tempted to give chuck new book chilly reception
how is litigating attorney who has never worked as an om buds and his book is published by the aba
yet om buds and attorneys would be welladvised to swallow their preconceptions because this book is an important resource for both professions
howard inadvertently became an advocate for om buds nearly twenty years ago and eventually built national practice advising and representing om buds
his clients included some of the leaders of the profession
he has seen the evolution of the field first hand and how courts can be confused by the varia ti on in om buds practice
these insights give howard considerable affinity and appreciation for the work of om buds
the primary purpose of the book howard explains is to demonstrate why properly constituted om buds program should be entitled to confidentiality re cog ni zed in law
in chapter howard starts at the very beginning tracing the development of the or ga ni zati on al om buds model from its swedish origins two centuries ago
he thoroughly details the history of om buds associations and how the professional standards matured into their current form
attached in the appendix are nearly pages of materials reflecting the evolution of the om buds standards of practice
many of these documents from the aba the ombudsman association toa university and col lege om buds association and international ombudsman association are difficult to locate in their entirety elsewhere
in the second chapter of his book howard explains why organizations should create om buds programs
his audience is not om buds but other professionals general counsel human resources and executives
howard summarizes the many risks faced by or ga ni zati ons with diverse and global constituents in an increasingly complex regulatory environment
he concludes that om buds are the appropriate resource to help people resolve conflict and report misconduct with these organizations
in chapter howard turns his attention to practicing om buds
using case law and statute he explains how om buds can protect their most fundamental attribute confidentiality
howard offers specific advice on how om buds can avoid serving as an agent of notice
he also explores some of the other legal bases for protecting confidentiality including the common law and statutes
the advice here is very specific and nates in own practice representing om buds
he tells om buds how their offices should be defined to prevent litigation and then how to respond when litigation occurs
howard provides many om buds to illustrate how om buds can better protect the con fi den ti ality they offer in their work
no nom buds are likely to find these case summaries especially insight especially because there are virtually no other publications that describe work
chapter is collection of other information relevant to practice
each section is intended as stand alone summary although the first section an book review charles howard the organizational ombudsman origins roles and operations legal guide chicago il american bar association pp
journal of the international ombudsman association overview of litigation processes is directly related to the prior chapter
this section covers lot of ground and includes exceptions to confidentiality and several statutes that impact om buds practice including the federal sentencing guidelines the act and open records acts
as the first true reference work on the field the organizational ombudsman is destined to become teaching resource
indeed it is already being used as textbook for at least one graduate course
as textbook it is well priced thorough and readable
students however will want an electronic version and professors will need ancillary materials neither of which is currently offered
like other legal guides and textbooks it will also need an update or supplement in few years
finally as complete as it is book needs companion
the organizational ombudsman does not tell how to do the work of an om buds
it offers no guidance for interviewing and coaching visitors con ducting inquiries facilitating and mediating conflicts or giving upward feedback
someday there will be book as good as that speaks to these skills also

the primary contact for is the editor who is re sponsible for the journal publication process and the journal web site
the editor directs the processing of manuscripts and maintains communication with the board of directors the associate editors editorial board members reviewers and authors
editorial board members and other members designated by the editor in special cases are resp on si for the peer reviews of the submitted manuscripts
uses blind review process and all references to the authors and workplace are removed prior to the manuscript being distributed to review ers
the editor andor associate editors will review each submitted manuscript to determine if the topic is appropriate for publication in
acceptable manuscripts will be distributed electronically to three editorial board members selected by the editor for peer review
manuscripts judged by the editor andor associate editors as inconsistent with the general mission of or the recognized standards of practice will be returned to the primary author with comments and possible suggestions for revision
reviewers will use consistent and systematic set of criteria to evaluate the quality and potential of manuscript
these criteria include items related to content organization style and relevance
review forms and comments will be returned to the editor
each reviewer will recommend one of the accept for publication as accept for publication with minor revisions as accept for publication after major revisions by revision and resubmission for subsequent reject manuscript the final decision on whether to publish manuscript is made by the editor and is based upon re com men dat ions from the peer reviewers

the editor may suggest or an author may request that member of the editorial board be available to pro vide assistance at various stages of the preparation and publication process
reviewing manuscripts for must be undertaken in accordance with the principles of the by demonstrating independence neutrality and con fi den ti ality
this requires that manuscripts be accorded the status of office visitors
the content of reviewed manuscripts and of reviews should not be shared with anyone other than the editor of the
it is important for reviews to have forward looking beneficial intent this is an opportunity to give feed back that will help nurture guide and develop author ship
it is not an exercise in showing you know more are wiser or more clever and literate in the subject matter
authors should learn from reviews and take away from the review sense of future direction and beneficial development for their paper
the aim of the review is to strengthen contributions to the and thereby strengthen the ombudsman profession
in this sense review is as much critique of the reviewer as of the manuscript
accordingly it is requirement that all reviews offer information that can help guide the author
although reviews journal of the international ombudsman association are confidential ie the manuscript author does not know who the reviewers are they are best written as though the author is in the room
accordingly use test of the assertions is the test if they were standing in the dock at the old bailey would they be able to justify their assertions to the author
are they making statements that are justifiable verifiable and credible or just say so
does the tone of their review convey the standards of practice in practice
where criticism is appropriate it should ideally be constructive and be contextual ised within set of options given by the reviewer for modification of the text
where there are clear mistakes inaccuracies or errors these should be indicated and corrections or options for alternative expression suggested
personal criticism whether of content ideology style or tone is unacceptable
please note suggestions for modification should be item ised and returned to the editor using the men ts to the section of the referee review form which is sent to reviewers together with the manuscript to be reviewed
suggestions for modi fi cation should not be returned to the editor in the form of in the original manuscript
this would identify the reviewer to the author and even if this does not concern the reviewer it might concern or prejudice the author in their consideration of the comments
reviewing is form of power relationship
that is why anonymity is required on both sides
manuscripts may come in variety of styles from the determinedly academic with numerous citations and references to the determinedly idiosyncratic and personal
all styles may be acceptable and need to be reviewed within their own context
opinion pieces may have been commissioned by the editor and where this is the case this will be indicated by the editor

the author is grateful to the three anonymous review ers for their comments and suggestions
the author is also grateful to joel neum an for his thorough and insightful review of an earlier draft of this manuscript in the early became interested in understanding persistent and enduring hostility at work
that interest was spurred by experience at the hands of her director
he yelled and screamed at her and others accusing her of not completing assignments which she actually had
he lied about her and other subordinates
he would deliberately avoid when staff needed his input and then berate them for not consulting with him
at other times he was thoughtful apologetic and even constructive
my colleague felt like she was walking on eggshells never sure how he would be
her coworkers had similar experiences and the group developed ways of coping and handling it
for example his secretary would warn staff when it was not good idea to speak with him
and yet his behavior took its toll on all of them
she called asking for my advice as dispute resolution person
gave her some ideas all things it turned out she had tried already
so like any good academic went to the literature to find out what was there
at that time there was very little about what had come to view as emotionally abusive behavior as described in the domestic violence literature
undertook some research to see if emotional abuse was workplace phenomenon kea sh ly macle an kea sh ly harvey hunter
as broadened my search in terms of disciplines and countries came across other constructs like bullying adams ra yn er ho el mobbing ley mann za pf harassment brod sky and abusive treatment bass man that in essence described the same phenomenon systematic and prolonged mistreatment of others at work kea sh ly
journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly since that time there has been virtual explosion of research in these areas and the addition of related constructs and terms such as workplace harassment bowling bee hr abusive supervision te pp er social undermining duffy et al incivility anders son pears on gill sypher interpersonal mistreatment lim cortina price sprat len ostracism ferris brown berry li an emotional tyranny wa ld ron workplace victimization aq ui no and disruptive practitioner behavior joint commission
as exciting as this is believe it has become confusing because it is hard to wrap arms around this area when the terms and their associated definitions multiply
thus it is hard to understand this phenomenon and therefore how to address it
fortunately several very good reviews of the literature that have come out that can be helpful in summarizing research on these constructs eg aq ui no ho el za pf griffin her sh co vis barling kell ow ay barling hurr ell martin ko douglas harvey te pp er the challenge is there are so many of those reviews that the construct proliferation and its accompanying confusion continues
for professionals who are faced with addressing these persistently hostile behaviors and relationships it is often difficult to know where to begin and what to include
also the time frame is often such that there is little time to distill the essence of what is known and not known from the empirical research literature
in this article will identify from my perspective as researcher and professional in this area the current thinking and findings that may be useful for ombudsmen in their deliberations and investigations as well as their management of these hostile behaviors and relationships with appropriate and timely interventions
to accomplish this using the term workplace bullying will discuss what is known about the nature prevalence and effects of these hostile relationships as well as current thinking on antecedents and processes of development
throughout this discussion will note the implications of different findings for the work of ombudsmen as they investigate and address work place bullying
will end this paper with brief discussion of the value of taking contingency perspective on the development and implementation of interventions for the prevention and management of bullying
workplace bullying is special case of work place aggression
workplace aggression refers to efforts by individuals to harm others with whom they work neum an baron
before addressing workplace unique features it is important to discuss aggressive behaviors more generally
never cease to be amazed at the range and type of behaviors that fall within this domain
to more completely map out this behavioral space neum an and baron utilized approach of three dimensions to define the space
the dimensions are physical deeds verbal words tone active doing behavior passive withholding or to and direct at the target indirect at something or someone the target values
while much research eg van den bos bul at ao kell ow ay barling hurr ell and public attention has been paid to physical active and direct behaviors such as shootings and assaults ie physical violence neum an and work and that of others eg cortina ma gley williams lang hout kea sh ly neum an ra yn er ho el cooper rich man ros penda na wyn fend rich drum johnson sch at fr one kell ow ay have demonstrated that the more frequent kinds of behaviors in work places particularly among organizational insiders are often passive indirect and nonphysical
these types of behaviors have been labeled as psychological aggression
for example in their representative survey of american workers sch at fr one and kell ow ay found the of workers report experiencing psychologically aggressive behavior at work while experienced physical aggression
workplace bullying actions are predominantly psychologically aggressive kea sh ly
ra yn er and categorization of bullying behaviors provides concise illustration of specific behaviors
this is not comprehensive listing of all possible behaviors but it will give an idea of ways in which bullying can be conducted
journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly
threat to professional status questioning competence belittling opinion professional humiliation in front of colleagues negative comments about intelligence questioning ability to supervisors spreading rumors or gossip
name calling insults verbal abuse tantrums intimidating be haviors devaluing with reference to age gender race ethnicity or appearance hostile gestures
exclusion from work related gather in gs silent treatment withholding information ignoring contributions not taking concerns seriously preventing access to opportunities or promotion poisoning others against the target
these behaviors tend to be passive in nature
undue pressure impossible deadlines unnecessary disruptions setting up to fail unreal or ambiguous expectations more so than for others in the same environment
others take credit for work assigning meaningless tasks removing responsibility denied raise or promotion without reason excessive monitoring
have several observations regarding these behaviors
first what is particularly unique about workplace bullying is that it is often about what people do not do rather than what they do ie of such as withholding information excluding from meetings the silent treatment ra yn er kea sh ly
this poses particular challenges for the target bystanders managers and third parties to whom these concerns are brought
thus it is important for ombudsmen to note that most aggressive behavior at work is psycho logical in nature and often passive or to behaviors
second the nature of the relationship between the target and actor will influence the specific expressions of hostility aq ui no neum an kea sh ly her sh co vis barling
this has to do with the means and opportunity available to the actor neum an kea sh ly
for example supervisor due to his her control over rewards and job assignments has the opportunity and the means to bully through overwork and destabilization types of behav io rs
opportunities available to peers may have more to do with information sharing and other working relationships
thus behaviors falling under threats to personal and professional standing as well as isolation are more likely under their control
subordinates due to their less powerful organizational position may engage in more indirect kinds of behaviors such as rumors or gossip or withholding of information
these examples of actor means and opportunity illustrate that bullying is not limited to one type of relationship
indeed bullying can be top down boss subordinate horizontal peer peer or bottom up subordinate boss ra yn er kea sh ly
thus workplace bullying is considered to be relational in nature harming others through purposeful manipulation and damage of relationships
this is important for ombudsmen to know as it requires that the relational context of the experience be assessed
thus investigations will need to involve at the very least assessment of target and actor and consideration of the nature of their relationship organizationally eg the kind of contact that is typically required for this type of relationships
third identifying the behaviors while necessary is insufficient for understanding workplace bullying ley mann
indeed in isolation each of these behaviors may be seen as minor and people may wonder what all the fuss is about so he glared at you
what makes these behaviors more than they appear is their frequency and the duration of exposure
workplace bullying and its related constructs are repeated and enduring forms of work place aggression
persistency is the core feature that distinguishes workplace bullying from more occasional aggressive treatment ley mann et al
the defining characteristics are as follows
negative actions that are repeated and patterned
this element captures both frequency of occurrence daily weekly monthly and variety more than one type of behavior
regardless of the construct it is the frequency of exposure to hostile behaviors that has been directly linked to variety of negative individual health job attitudes and behaviors and organizational productivity turnover outcomes ie the greater the exposure greater the impact kea sh ly neum an
being exposed to number of different hostile behaviors contributes to this sense of frequency
we found that the number of different events uniquely contributed to negative individual outcomes beyond the mean frequency of exposure kea sh ly macle an
but journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh lythe number of behaviors and the frequency of occurrence do not adequately capture the nature of exposure
frequency of exposure must also be considered in terms of the overall frequency of contacts with the actor
for example perhaps the boss only yells at an employee once month but if the employee only sees him her once month that is of the time
the implications of that for target are very different than for target whose actor behaves this way once month but they see him her daily ie they are exposed to other behaviors hopefully positive that will influence their overall experience
further the qu ency of exposure can be created or enhanced by the target reliving the experience ie rumination harvey kea sh ly
finally the repeated nature of exposure may be linked to the involve ment of more than one actor ie mobbing za pf
the repeated and patterned nature of these behaviors highlights the imp or tan ce of investigating pattern of behavior rather than each incident as separate item ra yn er kea sh ly
further the frequency of contact that would be required organizationally for the relationship is also important to consider in any assessment
it is duration that is particularly distinctive about workplace bullying
researchers have used time frames for assessing these actions ranging from six months which is typical in the european lit erat ure eg et al to year eg ash ly neum an sch at fr one kell ow ay to years eg cortina et al
these time frames pale in comparison to the reports of those who self identify as targets of workplace bullying
they report exposure ranging up to years bur nazi kea sh ly neum an za pf ho el va rt ia
za pf and gross report that average duration of those who were bullied by one person was months for those who were bullied by two to four people or more than people ie mobbing it was months and months respectively
thus the question of long is too is important to consider in this discussion of workplace bully ing
while researchers often specify at least one event weekly for minimum period of or months this time frame does not necessarily ap peal to those for example in human resources or indeed ombudsmen who will want to be able to address developing hostile situation as quickly as possible before irreversible damage sets in
thus codifying specific minimum duration in policy may hamper reporting of problems and ultimately effective management
it is sufficient to note that bullying tends to occur over an ex tended period of time
fourth while persistence or chronicity is the imp or ta nt marker of workplace bullying it is also imp or ta nt to recognize that the nature and intensity of behaviors directed at the target do not stay the same throughout
longstanding bullying situations will often show progression or escalation of aggression from covert and indirect behaviors to increasingly overt direct and in some situations physical
research suggests that such escalation will have the effect of rendering target at tempts to constructively and actively respond in ef fec rich man ros penda free ls za pf gross
this puts the target at increased risk for injury psychologically emotionally and physically see further discussion below
the failure of constr uc methods also may promote target resistance and retaliation behaviors lie fo og he that may further an escalatory spiral
such spirals can result in drawing others into the situation often as actors za pf gross and may even result in secondary spirals or cascades of aggression elsewhere in the unit or organization anderson pears on ie the development of hostile work environment
given the above description question is often raised as to how workplace bullying particularly at advanced stages is different from an escalated conflict between employees
what appears to distinguish bullying from workplace conflict is the existence of power imbalance et al
this imbalance can be preexisting in the structure of the workplace boss subordinate or it can develop as conflict escalates and one party becomes disadvantaged relative to the other
the importance of the imbalance is the potential impact on the resources and ability to defend him herself as well as the ability to continue their actions kea sh ly jagat ic
this has implications for the nature and journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly intensity of negative effects and highlights the imp or tan ce of prevention and early intervention as well as the necessity of strategies for remediation of effects
taken together the prolonged exposure to repeated hostile actions with an inability to defend creates situation in which the target becomes increasingly disabled kea sh ly
further such relationship if allowed to continue has the potential to not only spread its impact beyond the immediate dyad to others in the organization eg witnesses but it also has the possibility of creating hostile work environments where many workers are now
the bullying process with its progression and its span of impact illustrates the communal nature of workplace bullying nam ie
that is variety of different parties are involved in or impacted by workplace bullying
this communal nature requires that ombudsmen will need to engage number of people in the investigation and ultimately the management of the bullying
cy ber space the next and current frontier
before leaving this section on nature it is imp or ta nt to acknowledge modern technological devices as the new medium for bullying eg bullying through the internet email text messaging video picture clips and social networking sites
lois price sprat len ombudsman for the university of washington at the time was among the first to identify how email was being used to bully and harass others
known as cy ber bullying or cy ber aggression eg smith weather bee kell ow ay several unique features of the medium conspire to make it particularly virulent and destructive forum for and form of bullying
some of these features area the ability of the actors to be anonymous making it more difficult for both targets and those investigating to identify the source
by reducing detection actors may become emboldened to engage in more extreme and destructive attacks on the reputation os terman span of impact from few organizational members to millions of new media users globally and once these messages or images are released they are difficult to expunge from cy ber space creating situation in which exposure can be continually renewed and thus relived increasing damage to the target and others
it is critical that researchers and professionals focus their efforts on understanding the nature and impact of cy ber bullying and to seek ways to manage its use and impact
the consequences of workplace bullying have been demonstrated at individual group and organizational levels
at the individual level direct targets show disruption of psychological emotional and physical wellbeing as well as decrements in cognitive functioning eg distraction rumination poor job attitudes problematic job behaviors and decreased performance see et al
of particular note is the evidence of genuine trauma associated with prolonged mistreatment
some targets manifest symptoms characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder pt sd such as hyper vigilance nightmares and rumination cortina hau ge sk og stad jan son
witnesses bystanders to workplace bullying manifest similar symptoms and outcomes eg ho el far ag her cooper va rt ia
at the work group or unit level there is evidence of destructive political behav lack of cooperation and increasing incidence of interpersonal aggression eg li ao lim cortina ma gley
at the organizational level impact is manifested in organizational withdrawal behaviors of targets and other employ such as increased sick leave and presentee ism lowered organizational commitment increased turnover and loss of talent retaliation behaviors such as theft sabotage and violence and reputation al damage in the broader community ra yn er mc iv or te pp er carr br eaux gelder hu
recent research has begun to expand the victim net beyond organizational boundaries to include friends and family members who experience distress and strain as support for the targeted loved one barling hoo bl er brass
clearly workplace bullying left unchecked can have profound implications both inside and outside the organization
journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly how is the problem
so workplace bullying is hurtful and its effects are expansive
just how big problem is this
the prevalence depends on how workplace bullying is assessed the nature of the sample convenience organizational or representative of the nationwide workforce and the country
regarding measure ment there are two methods by which researchers assess exposure to bullying operational objective or self labeling subjective
the objective approach identifies someone as bullied based on whether they have experienced at least one hostile behavior weekly or more often for period of six months character is tic of european research or months typical in american studies
this method measures exposure to workplace bullying by means of behavioral checklist
for example person will indicate whether they have experienced someone at work withholding critical information from them
the self labeling method provides people with definition of bullying and asks if they have had such an experience in the past six months year or longer
this method measures experience of victimization
it is the experience of victimization that targets will provide to an ombudsman not simply exposure to specific behaviors kea sh ly
thus ombudsmen need to prepare to probe for the fullness of the experience as well as help the target provide specifics of incidents
typically rates of exposure are generally higher for the operational method than for the self labeling method that requires person to acknowledge she has been victim which sometimes people are re luc ta nt to do
so the self labeling method can be considered conservative estimate while the operational is more liberal estimate
european literatures show rates ranging from in scandinavian countries to in turkey see nielsen sk og stad matt hies en aas land not ela ers for fuller details while us literature reports from labeling to operational see kea sh ly jagat ic for fuller details
these rates apply to direct targets
if we extend the victim net to include witnesses the rates of exposure to workplace bullying jump dramatically
for example in representative sample of over us workers nam ie nam ie of respondents indicated they had witnessed others being bullied at work in the previous months
adding to this the who said they had been bullied during this same period almost of the american working adults are exposed to and affected by workplace bullying in month period
these rates refer to general working populations
exposure may be higher or lower in different organizations and occupations
in short workplace bullying is part of many working lives
discussion of the causes or contributions to workplace bullying requires the recognition of the multi causal nature of this phenomenon za pf
characteristics of the target the actor the work environment and the organizational context all play role to varying degrees and often in interaction in the manifestation of and on the flip side the prevention and management of workplace bullying ho el za pf cooper for review
useful frame work for considering what some of these antecedents are and how they may combine with one another comes from bailli en ne yens de wit te and de who propose three interrelated processes that may contribute to the development of bullying intrapersonal interpersonal and intragroup organizational
individual and work related antecedents are implicated in either being the source of these pro cesses or influencing how employees cope with the challenges created by these processes
will briefly describe these processes and how different factors are linked to them
the in tra personal pathway is one in which work place bullying is result of stressors and frustration and how employees cope with them
research in this area focuses on individual characteristics that may enhance vulnerability to be target or propensity to be an actor
relevant target characteristics are those that may affect what the individual perceives as occurring ie interpreting ambiguous behavior or situations as hostile or may provoke affective and behavioral reactions that are provocative to others or make them seem as targets for displaced aggression de bailli en de wit te
individuals with propensity to experience negative affect such as anger fear worry anxiety sadness and depression and associated traits of neuroticism reported higher levels of hostile treatment aq ui no bowling bee hr coy ne randall mil am spitz mu ell er penney
similarly relevant actor characteristics are ones associated with anxiety or anger and hostility such as negative affectivity trait journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly anger poor self control emotional susceptibility and irritability dispositional aggressiveness hostile at trib uti on al bias and unstable self esteem martin ko et al neum an and baron za pf all of which have been associated with increased aggressiveness
an lack of self re flection and poor perspective taking ability has been linked to engaging in bullying behaviors par kins fish be in ritchey za pf
what is interesting is that characteristics broadly characterized as negative affect and anxiety appear relevant to both targets and actors
so the question becomes what may explain an employee becoming either target or actor
bailli en et al suggest that it is ineffective coping behavior in response to frustrations which can come from both interpersonal and group level circumstances that may provide the key
specifically in their analysis of workplace bullying cases they found that an employee might become vulnerable to victimization by others when they cope with frustrations in passive inefficient way eg by withdrawing becoming helpless or reducing pro duc
such behavior may be perceived as violating existing norms not carrying load and result in other workers responding negatively towards them
when an employee copes with an experienced frustration in an active ineffective way they may displace their frustration onto an coworker result ing in bullying eg te pp er duffy hen le lambert
bullying grounded in these dynamics can be viewed as form of
to the extent this process is operational strate gies for prevention and management would focus on developing more effective stress and emotional management strategies on the part of workers
the in ter personal pathway is one where workplace bullying may result from interpersonal conflict that is ineffectively managed and escalates ie dispute related bullying kea sh ly no well za pf gross
in escalated conflicts everyone engages in increasingly hostile and damaging actions
these conflicts become bullying situations when one party becomes notably unable to defend themselves yet the other continues on an increasingly punitive path
indeed attempts by the target to actively address the issues are often unsuccessful and such failure is often tied to increasingly negative impact on the target rich man ros penda free ls
in this process the more powerful employee becomes the actor and the less powerful employee becomes the target
these can be challenging situations to assess as their genesis may have been mutually determined but the balance has swung
to the extent these pro cesses were predominant prevention efforts would focus on the development of constructive conflict management strategies and conflict intervention strategies for third parties eg managers bystanders
in tra group organizational pathway is one in which workplace bullying is viewed as result of unit or or ga ni zati on al features that enable or directly stimulate bullying
these can be particularly challenging to deal with as they are grounded in the way of doing work
model of enabling motivating and precipitating organizational features helps clarify how these factors may influence bullying development
briefly enabling features are structures and processes whose existence or nonexistence affect whether bullying is even possible
these include power imbalance which as noted earlier affects both the ability of the target to respond and defend and the means and opportunities available to an actor to mistreat low perceived costs and risks to engaging in bullying behaviors as reflected in organizational cultures in which harassment is equated with way to do business styles of leadership linked to controlling author it ar ian and uninvolved laissez fair leadership
also lack of clear and enforceable policy suggesting these behaviors are not problematic and the qualities of the working environment that create stress and frustration for employees such as unfair or inequitable treatment perceived injustice lack of autonomy and decision control poor communication role overload conflict and ambiguity and uncomfortable physical environments eg neum an baron
as noted above bullying may be the result of inefficient coping with these stressors
motivating features are structures and processes that it rewarding to harass sal in pg
these are conditions that promote the functionality of bullying ie as rational response to those perceived as or ho el sal in fels on
this includes internally competitive environments where employees are promoted or rewarded for outperforming other coworkers so it could be construed to be in an interest to undermine or sabotage another ie micro political behavior za pf
bullying can also be response to perceived norm violation on the part of coworker such as in an effort to bring them into journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly with production norms
bullying behavior can also be way of establishing social dominance
bullying can be used as constructive dismissal where the work environment is made so uncomfortable for someone that they leave
west hues talks about mob bing by professors against another as just such strategy
finally precipitating factors are structures and processes that may actually trigger an episode of bullying assuming other factors as noted above are in place
these factors are typically associated with some organizational changes such as changes in management or work group restructuring downsizing and increasing diversity bailli en de wit te neum an baron
the argument is that these changes create stress anxiety and frustration which can lead to aggressive responding as discussed above
sal in argues that bullying is result of an interaction among at least two of these factors if not all three
this set of processes are perhaps the most challenging to address as we are in essence talking about redesigning work environment and changing its culture and resultant climate
the challenge of address in workplace bully in gas can be seen from this admittedly brief and selective presentation of research on workplace bully ing this is phenomenon that is dynamic relational and communal in nature
its dynamics can spiral to encompass and impact other organizational members and extend its reach outside the organization
while played out by individuals it is the structure and processes that play pivotal roles in whether and how bullying is manifested ie bullying is fundamentally systemic problem kea sh ly nam ie
it is this belief of the systemic nature of bullying that has researchers and professionals calling for organizational leaders and managers to take responsibility for leading the efforts in prevention and management of workplace bullying
recent scholarship has begun to identify and assess what organizational and management efforts are important for developing culture and climate that are antithetical to bullying for detailed discussion see ho el fox stall worth giga kea sh ly neum an os at uke moore sc ward dy ren forth belton ra yn er mc iv or sal in
organizational culture change however is long term process
in the meantime there will be work place bullying and the question is how to intervene to effectively manage and mitigate its impact
as is hopefully clear from the research there are different points in the process at which action could notably change its course
there are also variety of actions that could be undertaken at each of these points
what have found useful as way of thinking about how to ameliorate workplace bullying is applying the contingency approach of conflict intervention
while full exposition of this approach is beyond the scope of this article see kea sh ly no well for more detail would like to briefly describe its fundamental principles and what it highlights about addressing bullying
the contingency approach is grounded in the idea that effective intervention in conflict depends upon matching the actions to the phase of conflict development discussion polarization segregation and destruction and different issues that are prominent in each stage
for example in the early phase of conflict parties while disagreeing are still openly communicating and see value in maintaining their relationship
thus useful action might be helping parties have constructive discussions through negotiation or if somewhat heated through mediation
at much later stage where parties are polarized communication distorted and behavior is becoming destructive initial action involves stopping the destructive behav and if successful then perhaps utilizing version of shuttle diplomacy to focus on more substantive issues
the other aspect of contingency approach is the recognition that deescalation cannot be accomplished by single action but requires coordinating sequence of activities over time to move parties back down the spiral
applying this perspective to workplace bullying highlights number of important considerations
the need to thoroughly and critically assess the history and current status of the bullying situation
this knowledge makes it possible to select methods of intervening that increase the chances of at least minimizing damage and at most rebuilding the parties particularly the target the working relationship as well as the working environment for others
journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly
individuals observing the actor and target interactions can play critical roles in helping to manage the situation
as revealed by research documenting span of impact other people have stake in this situation being resolved constr uc
bystanders represent critical yet untapped group that could have profound influence in bullying situations particularly in the not yet bullied phase ash burn nar do morris good win kea sh ly and neum an ro we
the need to view dealing with bullying as comprehensive and coordinated effort of number of different activities and number of different parties
it highlights the importance of coordinating short term crisis management interventions such as separation of the parties with longer term methods directed at fundamentally altering the relationship specifically and the system generally
such coordinated and comprehensive efforts require organizational awareness of bullying and commitment to dealing with it directly
location in the organizational system positions them well for developing and facilitating these types of efforts
it provides an explanation for why some actions may fail ie they were inappropriate for the circumstances
for example mediation has been recommended as an approach for addressing workplace bullying eg ho el ra yn er cooper sch mi dt
critics argue that in cases of severe bullying the target is not able to participate fully as an equal party
further focus on the future can be way for the actor to avoid having to take responsibility for their ac ti ons
thus mediation may be more appropriate early on but less effective and even detrimental in later stages
recognition that damage inherent in severe bullying limits the means of handling such situations
as discussed under harm long term exposure to bullying effectively disables and damages the target and often others so that turn to is highly unlikely
this highlights the importance of preventive measures addressing harmful interactions early not yet bullied ra yn er before more damage occurs and when there is chance for rebuilding productive relationships
individual skill development on the part of all parties such as communication anger management stress management perspective taking and conflict management skills may be relevant in these relationships preventing bully ing from becoming entrenched
while enhancing individual skills is important the organizational context can either support or undermine them sal in
so any efforts must acknowledge organizational culpability and focus change at this level as well
con cl us io bullying is persistent relational aggression
it has tremendous potential to escalate drawing in others beyond the initial actor target relationship
its effects can be devastating and wide spread individually organizationally and beyond
it is fundamentally systemic phenomenon grounded in the culture
ombudsmen are in unique position organizationally to become aware of these types of relationships and to provide leadership in assessing and responding effectively and constr uc to the benefit of all organizational members
it is my hope that the research discussed in this article has provided information and insight that will help ombudsmen in their efforts to address this devast at ing phenomenon and to develop culture of respect and dignity for all employees where bullying has no place

ombudsman om buds workplace bullying neutrality challenges
the authors are grateful to carolyn for the interesting discussions when we first began discussing our thoughts about bullying in the workplace as well as her ideas and continued collaboration on this topic
or al it yn either the attached paper nor its essential content has been published or is under consideration for pub li cation elsewhere
graduate student tells the om buds of being reprimand ed and hollered at for over half hour in the hallway by senior faculty member who was both her dissertation advisor and employer
at one point when the student attempted to walk away the professor told her that she was not to move until he allowed her to move and monitored his watch as if timing her punishment
the professor was so loud and aggressive that another fac member called the campus police
after the incident the student had to be taken by her family to be treated for an anxiety attack which she had never previously en countered
even after she met with the dean and he as signed her different professor to work with and told her that the original faculty member would not be able to retaliate against her she discussed having real difficulty focusing on her studies constantly thinking about the exchange and having headaches and stomachaches
she was extremely angry and frustrated because to her knowledge the professor was not reprimanded and con ti nu ed to serve in leadership role in the department
in io na ny one who reads this account of graduate experience with her advisor and supervisor is bound to be affected
om buds are not immune to the emotional effects of hearing alleged targets de scribe demeaning encounters
bullying cases provide many challenges they particularly provide potential challenges to om buds neutrality
the authors were reminded of this recently when former univ er of hawaii om buds susan park made similar observation while speaking at summer werner institute web in ar on the topic of workplace bully ing
as the own experiences had led them to arrive at similar conclusion they decided to journal of the international ombudsman association and rudolph explore some of the underlying sources of these challenges
this article will briefly review om buds neutrality and then explore many factors which can promote bias
it will conclude with review of considerations and strategies intended to help om buds avoid or minimize the possibility of acting on these biases and to the extent possible protect om buds neutrality
om buds neutrality organizational om buds like everyone else have their own unique life experiences values perspectives preferences and opinions
these affect how they think and view the world
om buds inevitably like trust and respect some people they meet more than others and they relate to and identify with some more readily than others
and just like everyone else they also have biases
their challenge of course is to act neutrally which means being aware of and refraining from acting on their personal biases
the extent to which an om buds is perceived by others as is largely result of how the om buds acts
but even if an om buds acts in ways she or he believes will convey neutrality she or he has no control over how these actions will be interpreted by others
thus om buds neutrality is often an elusive goal to which om buds aspire but only sometimes achieve
in circumstances involving allegations of workplace bullying om buds may find this goal even more elusive than usual
in their booklet entitled what an organizational ombudsperson might want to know howard gad lin and the late elizabeth walsh pino suggest that neutrality means do not take sides during conflicts
they add that neutrality means om buds should act in open minded and manner
the international ombudsman association standards of practice use such words as and in attempting to clarify the meaning of neutrality
standard indicates the importance of avoiding actual or apparent conflicts of interest
and standard reminds organizational om buds of to consider the legitimate concerns and interests of all individuals in matters in which they become involved
while absolute neutrality is simply impossible to achieve these standards make clear that om buds must try to recognize their biases while functioning in the om buds role and above all avoid acting on them in interactions with constituents
potential threats to om buds neutrality many factors that are fairly unique to bullying cases can create om buds biases which challenge an ability to function neutrally
some are rooted in human nature and others are more organizational or systemic in nature
each of and their potential effects will be explored below
all om buds practitioners have core values which support their professional identities as om buds practitioners
many om buds are selected for their positions because they are seen as approachable fair respectful sensitive andor empathic
they often take pride in having cultivated these characteristics and are pleased to be recognized for them
by contrast people who are accused of bullying are often de scribed as mean unfair disrespectful insensitive andor uncaring
thus the potential exists that upon hear ing these descriptions of the behaviors of an alleged bully an om buds may be personally predisposed to dislike the person exhibiting bullying behavior
and of course this tendency can be exacerbated for any om buds who as child an adult or both was bullied or otherwise abused
in addition most om buds have passion for fairness and justice and these core values can appear to be at risk the moment an om buds hears an alleged target say am being treated unfairly
work in it alleged targets attempting to help someone who cries from the moment she or he begins to talk about problem can be an intimate bonding experience between an om buds and visitor
when visitor returns multiple times to the safety of an om buds office to share additional details of humiliating frustrating and painful experiences an om buds can vicariously experience high level of emotional pain
for some prolonged and repeated exposure to this pain and to an alleged helplessness in dealing with it can create an emotional
the anxiety attacks headaches and stomachaches reported by the graduate student in the example above are not uncommon
the impact of an alleged story can be powerful and can lead an om buds to feel self journal of the international ombudsman association and rudolph doubt
she or he may think sounds urgent
am capable of helping someone in this much distress
or she or he may experience role confusion eg are my responsibilities here given that this situation sounds so terrible
maintaining neutrality as well as positive mental health requires an om buds to avoid per seve rating on other problems or ones inability to alleviate their pain
but for some this may be much easier said than done
while interactions with an alleged target can lead an om buds to develop partiality toward her or him as is true in many other kinds of cases om buds neutrality may be challenged in different direction against an alleged target
this can occur for several possible reasons
one reason is that listening compassionately to people experiencing emotional distress can be exhausting and an om buds can experience fig ley
another reason om buds neutrality may be challenged is if an alleged target has visited the office many times with variety of issues ie
finally om buds may find some targets more challenging than others
most om buds understand that practicing with neutrality means they must refrain from acting impulsively eg urging visitor to take particular course of action contacting and accusing an alleged bully of wrongdoing demanding that an alleged supervisor take disciplinary action etc
but after prolonged exposure to an alleged highly emotional story replete with rich supporting details more realistic possibility is that an om buds will feel sympathy for and as result develop partiality toward an alleged target andor bias against an alleged bully
this could lead her or him to make in ap propria te evaluative comments to an alleged target such as terrible and it needs to stop
or one should be treated like that
whether intentional or not these kinds of comments signal am on your side
even subtle nonverbal cues eg laughing at sarcastic remarks made by an alleged target about an alleged bully can send this signal
this partiality towards an alleged target may affect the way an om buds assists an alleged target
for example when reviewing options with an alleged target an om buds with bias might emphasize the advantages and deemphasize the disadvantages of an alleged target writing letter to request that an upline manager administer disciplinary action to an alleged bully
such an attempt at influencing the options visitor chooses suggests that some degree of neutrality has been lost
work in it alleged bull ie sw hile the experience suggests the majority of om buds contacts are with an alleged target in few instances an om buds will talk with an alleged bully for example when an alleged target requests mediation or shuttle diplomacy or when an alleged bully initiates request for om buds assistance per haps after being threatened with or receiving formal disciplinary action for engaging in bullying
very often alleged bullies tell om buds they do not view their own behavior as
if they are supervisors they may say they have standards people ac countable for mistakes or that they communicate in fashion
some of these individuals have been promoted because they are technically competent and viewed as indispensible by leaders
as result their bullying behaviors are sometimes overlooked and occasionally rewarded
keeping an open mind while talking with someone who has been portrayed so negatively can certainly be challenging especially if she or he admits to engaging in these behaviors but minimizes them andor fails to recognize their impact eg everyone getting so worked up about
so what if raised my voice few times
in these situations if an om buds recognizes having such thoughts as got what you or was really out of line such thinking can easily translate into subtle nonverbal behaviors that convey bias
and it is very possible visitor in this circumstance could pick up on this judgment and leave the office feeling that the om buds is biased prejudiced and of no help
one of the authors worked for time on rape crisis hotline
during the training for this position the trainees encountered counselor who worked with rap is ts
her initial reaction was would anyone want to work with rapists
but upon reflection she came to realize that working effectively with rapists was critically important because success in this endeavor could prevent future victims
the authors recognize that workplace bullying does not equate to rape and that the om buds role is certainly different from that of counselor who works with offenders
however the om buds role does sometimes provide the opportunity to work with those who engage in workplace bullying
if an alleged bully leaves the office feeling the om buds was biased against her or him not only has an om buds the neutrality but she or journal of the international ombudsman association and rudolph he has also missed potentially rich opportunity to help someone to recognize and possibly change behaviors which have damaging impacts on others
an om buds may receive multiple complaints over period of time about the same alleged bully
or an om buds may meet with group of individuals who complain about one
sometimes after one person from department approaches an om buds to disclose workplace bullying problem others make appoint men ts individually to talk about the same problem
for any organizational om buds hearing multiple complaints can pose serious threat to her or his ability to remain neutral especially when those complaints portray consistent picture of the alleged aggressive demeaning conduct
and this neutrality challenge is amplified if the om buds had previous difficult interactions with someone an alleged target describes as bully especially if the om buds felt disrespect ed or dismissed by the way that person treated her or him
on the other hand if an om buds has had previous positive experiences with an alleged bully it could cause her or him to react skeptically to any allegation that she or he had engaged in bullying
this especially if acted upon can be as much of problem for om buds neutrality as negative bias
om buds are likely to gain exposure to many sources of information related to bullying
the topic of bullying has gained significantly more attention in recent years and in the us with growing number of attempts to introduce legislation all of which having failed as of the date of this writing the topic will continue to receive attention
few cautions for om buds will be presented below regarding much of the information related to bullying
professional development for om buds includes reading books and articles about topics related to their work
there is growing body of literature devoted to the topic of workplace bullying
most of the authors of these publications eg books articles web sites blo gs take an unapologetic stance and some use highly value laden language in describing eg jerks back stabbers manipulators etc
many books about this topic have been published including such titles as the no asshole rule jerks at work lloyd corporate hey en as at work marais herman crazy bosses bing snakes in suits babi ak hare and brutal bosses and their prey horn stein
while these authors are bringing needed attention to this topic these titles obviously created to sell books tend to demonize alleged bullies
some of their about what motivates their behavior eg they are jealous of the people they bully appear to be based only on their own speculation or on the reported perceptions of people who say they have been bullied
and their use of language is far from anything resembling neutrality
while these authors are bringing serious attention to topic they see as having gone unaddressed for far too long none of them are organizational om buds who are obligated to follow the standards of practice
blanket ac cep tan ce by an om buds of negative assumptions about alleged bullies could create bias and thus threat to om buds neutrality
exposure to media coverage of several recent tragic events seemingly related to workplace and other bullying could also undermine om buds neutrality when working with cases involving workplace bullying
for example the recent suicide of university of virginia employee and the corresponding allegations that this tragic event occurred as result of bullying by his supervisor was presented in segment on on august
while the segment did reveal that the suicide victim had been clinically depressed much more attention was given to the possible role of his supervisor and the alleged lack of responsiveness by officials at the university of virginia to the numerous requests for their help during the last two weeks of his life
this dramatic story may focus more attention on the po ten ti ally devastating effects of workplace bullying but six minute clip edited for television may not provide the rich nuanced treatment such an important topic deserves
in fact much of the public discourse about this topic seems to exhibit the dualism of two opposing narratives eg must be either bullying or performance problem
or must be bullying or the person was severely depressed
the media and the public in general want simple answer but as om buds we often learn the truth eg an individual has performance problem and is being bullied or an individual is severely depressed and is being bullied
journal of the international ombudsman association and rudolph potential threats to perceptions of om buds neutrality when dealing with specific cases involving allegations of workplace bullying om buds interactions with supervisors of alleged bullies andor other organizational leaders provide very specific threats to the reality as well as the perception of om buds neutrality
the most obvious of these is in being perceived as biased against an alleged bully because the om buds has initiated discussion with supervisor or leader about the alleged behavior
in their article global interest in skillfully applying standards of nancy er be and tom acknowledged this threat facing an om buds
the ombudsman may be perceived as aligned against the alleged bullying supervisor and advocating for those who have complained
at the very least ap proach ing management in this situation risks ap pear ing to be in violation of sop an ombudsman not advocate on behalf of any individual in the and sop an ombudsman
has an obligation to consider the legitimate concerns and interests of all individuals affected by the matter under especially if the manager trusts respects and regularly depends on the supervisor in question
should an om buds be perceived in this way her or his neutrality credibility and effectiveness is at risk
other challenges for om buds when assisting in cases in vo lv ing bullying besides the challenges to neutrality bullying cases present other challenges for om buds that can make these cases more difficult to manage and resolve
these challenges include the lack of common definition of the absence of laws and policies prohibiting bullying behavior lack of awareness of bullying history of unresponsiveness to bullying behavior and power imbalances
each of these factors will be explored below
no common def initio of workplace bully in there is no commonly accepted definition of bullying
charlotte ra yn er suggested that for someone to be bullied she or he needed to have had negative experiences these negative experiences must have been repeated and persistent she or he must label herself or himself as target of bullying and there must be an imbalance of power between the parties
the draft legislation known as the workplace which is available on popular anti bullying web site
work place bullying org defines bullying as repeated health harming mistreatment of one or more persons the targets by one or more perpetrators that takes one or more of the following forms verbal abuse offensive conduct behaviors including nonverbal which are threatening humiliating or intimidating or work interference sabotage which prevents work from getting workplace bullying institute
visitors to om buds offices describe work place bullying as behaviors they see as inappropriate for the work or school environment and cite variety of different examples such as hollering restricting movement cursing banging on tables reprimanding others in public isolating overworking not providing support and engaging in behaviors that violate another personal dignity
this lack of clear universally understood definition leaves everyone in an organization in the position of supreme court justice potter stewart who famously commented about in the case ja co belis ohio know it when see it
unfortunately what different people is not the same
for example some males may be less apt to label themselves as target of bullying
and when two employ are being treated in the same aggressive manner by the same supervisor if one is devastated and the other only annoyed is it bullying in both cases
might supervisor who identifies mistake or professor who negatively evaluates performance be engaged in bullying or simply providing appropriate supervision
thus the absence of common definition as well as differences in culture gender values personalities and life experiences etc
create ideal conditions for conflict about what actually constitutes workplace bullying
journal of the international ombudsman association and rudolph few laws or pol ic ie sal though recent research suggests that work place bullying may be four times more common than sexual harassment and more de str uc her sh co vis in most countries in the world there are no laws against it
in the present litigious climate and in the absence of case law precedents legal counsel whose influence is often significant may advise against developing anti bullying policies even if they recognize it as problem
they are concerned about protecting the organization from being sued by people against whom disciplinary action was taken for engaging in behavior which may be viewed by courts in the absence of any other law as speech
the absence of policy often limits human resources departments from formally investigating even if they recognize that workplace bullying is serious prob
complaints by members of protected classes eg gender race age religion etc
who say they have been bullied may be formally investigated if they label the bullying as and say they believe it occurred because of their protected class status yet of employees experiencing the identical treatment do not have this option
om buds are likely to observe the sharp contrast in organizational responsiveness to bullying complaints as compared to charges of discrimination
this can be very unsettling and frankly seem very unfair especially in cases where bullying has been alleged to be particularly egregious
david yam ada professor at suffolk university law school looked at another possible option for targets of bullying behavior intentional infliction of emotional distress ii ed
ii ed has been introduced in tort law but yam ada found that the threshold for holding the employer liable is unrealistically high
yam ada is the author of the workplace which defined in the section above
to date no federal or state laws have been enacted in the us although there are laws in sweden at work australia has anti bullying laws and the canadian province of quebec has law against harassment at enacted in
lack of awareness many leaders are unaware that bullying occurs
this could be true because no one bullies leaders due to their status and authority they observe others engage in bullying because subordinates tend to be on their best behavior around them some leaders have conflict avoidant style and the ability to be of bullying allows such leader to avoid the problem if those experiencing or witnessing bullying are far below leader in the organizational ladder they may be too intimidated to talk to the leader about problem of bullying andor some leaders have highly competitive conflict style and may even engage in bullying and as result do not recognize it as problem
combination of two additional structural factors can allow workplace bullying to remain invisible to leaders
the physical separation from sub or di nates occurs in large organizations where leaders work in different buildings or in executive suites away from departments where bullying might be occurring
also the direction in which communication occurs in hierarchies can contribute to workplace bullying
if one of top direct reports bullies her administrative assistant the top administrator is unlikely to hear about it because the top administrator gets most of his or her information from the person being accused of bullying
thus leaders are not in location to see bullying occur and they are not being told about the problem so they remain unaware of it
graduate student told one of the authors students warned me not to work with this pro fess or because he has reputation for mistreating his students yet no one ever tells him to stop because he brings in huge research grants
an employee said people have told me to weather it out as find someone else to pick on soon
another employee said half of the people in our unit have resigned or transferred since ms vicious arrived months ago
they all just happen to find other opportunities within the same journal of the international ombudsman association and rudolph short period of time
many alleged targets actually have multiple complaints have been bullied by john has been bullying people in our department for long time and those with authority have been repeatedly told about it no one will do anything to stop him from engaging in this behavior
and of course many employees talk to one another
if it is common belief that no one will address bullying the willingness of people ex peri enc ing or witnessing bullying to complain about it will be negatively impacted
and when alleged bullies re ce ive promotions it is likely to be interpreted as proof that the organization care about bullying and even more disturbing that bullying is rewarded
for the graduate student in the above example the stakes were exceedingly high
her advisor was technically speaking her employer
moreover he had enormous power over her academic and professional future
yet tenured professor who acts this way is unlikely to face any consequences for her or his ac ti ons
as john fra zee observed only limited authority to their chairs and deans who are not their bosses professors are essentially free agents
their free agency is byproduct of two of the most dist inc attributes of the profession tenure and academic
thus as is often the case when bully ing is alleged the for graduate students is far from
in study based on self report data provided by people who said they had been bullied in of the cases it was supervisor who had engaged in this behavior
thus power imbalances appear to play significant role in workplace bullying
this combination of challenges to om buds neutrality as well as other challenges to recognizing and re sp onding to workplace bullying can lead an om buds to conclude that within an organization the is against people who wish to raise concerns about bullying and to advocate for those who allege bullying
strategies to avoid or minimize om buds bias as well as the perception of om buds bias when workplace bullying is alleged the three kinds of people with which an om buds is likely to interact are alleged targets alleged bullies andor supervisors of alleged bullies
practicing with neutrality means listening and speaking to all of these constituents in ways that suggest an om buds respects them has an open mind and wants to understand their per spec without rushing to judgments
carrying this out in real time requires skill and practice
specific skills and few reminders about key components of the om buds role will be presented below
regardless of the mental and emotional re ac ti ons felt by an om buds it is critically important that she or he be honest with herself or himself about what she or he is feeling and thinking
this acknowledgment is first step in managing own ti ons
any om buds who does not do this runs the risk of being disconnected from her or his own thoughts andor feelings thus increasing the risk she or he may develop and act on unconscious biases
lis ten and ass is is it or in id if in opt io ns bob fink now retired faculty om buds from the university of colorado at boulder was once asked by new department chair if he had any suggestions to help him in his new role
after thinking about it for moment fink said you probably get into too much trouble by listening to fink
this of course is an exceptionally useful reminder for an organizational om buds too
when talking with others who express intense emotion it can be help for practitioner to remind herself or himself to focus primarily on listening
paraphrasing reflecting feelings and summarizing as well as open ended questions are exceptionally valuable tools at this point
and it may also help to remember that listening often allows visitor to better understand her or his own experience and clarify her or his most important interests priorities and goals
finally if the emotion journal of the international ombudsman association and rudolph ally charged aspects of such an interaction become overwhelming two things may be helpful to remember there are likely to be other more appropriate resources eg available to provide emotional support and to assist visitors in managing their ti ons and an om buds only has control over her or his own choices and behaviors
while it is useful to remember that providing on go ing emotional support and psychological counseling is not requirement of the organizational om buds role it is equally important to remember what the role does require
standard of practice suggests om buds help people to
develop range of options to resolve problems and facilitate discussion to identify the best options
om buds also help visitors to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of various options to meet their interests and goals
and it may also help to remember that this is rarely linear process
often the discussion seems to take circuitous route and deeper concerns and priorities are not always clear either to her or him or to an om buds until various options are being discussed
when om buds encounter alleged bullies who deny engaging in bullying especially if one or more alleged targets andor bystanders have provided rich details which contradict her or his ver sion of events an om buds may feel mistrust and or dislike toward her or him
again remembering that the om buds role is not to judge her or him is vitally important
the role requires an om buds to listen and try to understand her or his point of view concerns interests and goals
an om buds also has the opportunity to carefully explore with her or him the extent to which she or he understands the impact of her or his behavior on the alleged target andor the extent to which she or he cares about that
as was referenced earlier it may be useful for an om buds to remember she or he may have an opportunity with some but definitely not all people who have been accused of workplace bullying to help her or him recognize these impacts andor if she or he has concerns about them to help her or him to identify alternative and more appropriate and effective approaches
and remaining curious may be especially helpful in working with alleged bullies
this is especially true if in the safety of confidential conversation this curiosity can stimulate an alleged bully to begin to wonder why she or he be haves this way what other alternatives might exist for gaining cooperation or how alleged targets have been affected by this behavior
whether an organizational om buds is meeting with an alleged target or with an alleged bully or for that matter when meeting with anyone who has initiated meeting to request help very useful self talk mantra is have only heard one and wonder how the person about whom this visitor is complaining sees this situation
the part is very important because maintaining curiosity is another strategy for avoiding making judgments and maintaining neutrality
with respect to minimizing the effects of the afore mentioned popular literature it is useful for om buds to question the data
while self report data provided by individuals who perceive they were bullied can be compelling and much of it may be accurate it is important to remember where the data is coming from and seek data from variety of sources
alternative more literature may be hard to find but one book the authors recommend is called the abrasive by laura craws haw
it does not focus on demonizing people specifically managers who may engage in bullying but rather in understanding them and using tools designed to help them recognize the negative impacts of their behavior and more importantly the sources of it and strategies they can use to operate differently and more effectively in the workplace
while communicating with an alleged supervisor or other organizational leaders nancy er be and tom offered number of suggestions intended to address the possible perception supervisor or leader may have that an om buds is biased the ombudsman can preface any conversation with manager by reminding her or him that while she or he needs to discuss pattern of concerns that have been brought to her or his attention as an ombudsman she or he is designated neutral
therefore she or he is not an advocate for or against anyone in the journal of the international ombudsman association and rudolph organization even though raising this kind of concern about alleged behaviors involving single individual may make it look that way er be
they also anticipate the likely question an upline supervisor or leader may have about why an om buds is not talking directly with the alleged bully which they suggest can be by referring to standard of practice on confidentiality which says in part does the ombudsman reveal information provided in confidence that could lead to the identification of any individual contacting the ombudsman office without that express
er be and also suggest reminding manager that the information the om buds has is only anecdotal not and they recommend suggesting to her or him that in order to be fair to the supervisor it might be beneficial to use degree evaluations andor exit interviews to get fuller and more accurate picture
and finally they recommend that if the manager uncovers evidence of matter of fairness the manager might want to present the information to the supervisor give her or him an opportunity to respond discuss her or his expectations of appropriate supervisory behavior and if she or he feels it appropriate consider giving the supervisor assistance eg coaching counseling for improving this important area of her or his work performance er be
many of the factors which can affect how allegations of bullying are perceived and responded to eg lack of definition absence of laws andor policies lack of awareness history of un re sp ons ive ness and power imbalances could lead an om buds to partiality toward those alleging they have been bullied
more appropriate option would be for an om buds to engage leaders and other stake holders in recognizing the impact of these factors through informal discussions andor workshop presentations or by sending them relevant information
in doing this it is important for an om buds to remind herself or himself that the roles these leaders occupy are likely to affect the information they have and how they view allegations of bullying
in separate discussions unrelated to individual cases in which bullying is alleged om buds may elect to engage legal counsel human resources and organizational leaders in discussions about how this problem might best be addressed given the lack of laws pro hi biting it or perhaps in recognizing and considering possible indices that it is problem eg an excessive number of people leaving department excessive use of sick or vacation leave etc
if an om buds learns of anti bullying policies and leadership statements developed in especially for similar kind of organization eg large research university sharing this information with leaders can be useful as well
in crease awareness some om buds provide workshops about conflict related topics within their organizations
general conflict management workshops for supervisors can include this topic
in addition stand alone workshop on workplace bullying can be an excellent opportunity to present important information about the topic
both of these kinds of workshops also provide an op port unity to underscore the neutral om buds role
for example an om buds might present the workplace bullying institute survey of nearly people which revealed number of very disturbing findings
but in addition to presenting this information cautionary note might be added explaining that the research findings were based entirely on self reports of those who said they had been bullied
con cl us io nor ga ni zati on al om buds who become involved in cases involving allegations of workplace bullying face many factors which can threaten their neutrality as they attempt this difficult work
om buds bias whether perceived or real can seriously damage the effectiveness of an om buds with all parties involved alleged targets alleged bullies and upline supervisors
despite these numerous factors and their potentially negative impacts there are skills strategies and practices an organizational om buds can use that will help her or him protect om buds neutrality
ombudsman incivility systems thinking change agent work group
the author wishes to acknowledge the assistance of tom om buds at the university of colorado at boulder and karen starry director of graduate student services and progress at the university of minnesota for their thoughtful insights and helpful feedback throughout the development and pro duc ti on of this article
about time someone did something about
recent years many ombudsmen have noticed growing trend in the incidence of negative and destructive behaviors referred to by terms such as bullying incivility and academic harassment as central feature of their caseload
the quote above along with others throughout this article is taken from survey of graduate students regarding their ex peri enc es with such behavior
the comment conveys impatience with the environment where graduate students feel vulnerable to those who would use their position or power to intimidate or harass them
as an ombudsman at the university of minnesota of work with over graduate and professional students year who are seeking assistance with problem
those problems are increasingly related to experiencing or witnessing hostile behavior in the academic or work environment
the issue may concern an adviser delaying their degree progress in order to retain cheap source of labor faculty member taking advantage of student research assistant who fears losing their visa status or one graduate student taking credit for another work
and while ombudsmen are long familiar with dealing with these issues on case by case basis this paper focuses on how to use the information gleaned from individual cases to initiate and promote an organizational collaboration to address incivility concerns systemically
journal of the international ombudsman association harassment problems seen in my department appear to be the result of structural issues
while those in authority are aware of the problems there seem to be real means of satisfactory resolution
problem of toxic behavior in the academic environment is an important issue for many reasons
through our work and my colleagues have seen both the significant personal toll that such behavior takes on individuals as well as the negative impact it can have on departments and the larger organization
disturbingly high number of students who experience or witness harassing behaviors report serious consequences such as emotional and physical prob le ms or academic difficulties
in some cases students are so distressed that had thoughts of suicide or decided that their only recourse is to leave their graduate program or the university
universities can ill afford to ignore such repercussions of destructive behavior
strong graduate programs contribute to the overall reputation of research institutions and the competition among universities for the best graduate students is costly and intense
prospective students get information through electronic social media even before arriving on campus and from current students during campus visits
culture and environment are among the criteria used by students when selecting school for their graduate studies
even otherwise stellar graduate programs risk losing top prospects when programs or institutions are known for tacitly permit ting academic harassment
as ombudsmen we are uniquely positioned through our experience training and access to institutional resources to address academic harassment
some ombudsmen may wish to simply report on the number of cases or trends of incivility to the responsible authorities and rely on the administration to
this may be an option if there is sufficient interest and support among administrative leadership organizations however can be reluctant to acknowledge that the distasteful problem of bullying exists on their campus
there is much however that the ombudsman can accomplish
informed by case and survey data the ombudsman as neutral can work across the institution to build web of connectivity among those individuals who are interested in the topic
some ays will never forgive those who knew of this situation to continue to allow helpless graduate students to work with this how many times have you heard this before
need to make mentor ing skills valued part of the tenure process and graduate students need to feel they have rights and power to not be abused
note that the ombudsman does not serve as of cause but instead acts as catalyst serving as an equal member of group of knowledgeable and committed stake holders who worked collaboratively to develop and implement cultural change effort
the main thrust of this article is how the of work group used our connections organizational resources and to clarify the emergent problem of academic incivility on our campus identify systemic conditions that foster uncivil behavior design and implement action steps to address such behavior and evaluate outcomes
the group also promoted campus wide discussion to increase awareness about the importance of positive learning and working environment and the costs of toxic behavior and provided written materials and workshops to support the development of the skills that it takes to tackle this very difficult problem
part of the role is to address within their organization this work goes be yond the level of the individual problem and tries to get at the origins of problematic issue
the approach outlined above provides the opportunity to make more significant impact on systemic problem than simply noting an up tick in cases of academic harassment in report and is consistent with the standards of practice which describe an informal process whereby the ombudsman
looks into procedural irregularities andor broader systemic problems
journal of the international ombudsman association think this is very worthwhile study on your part
the kind of harassment asking about is far more common at most universities than most people realize and it should be taken seriously
began by reviewing the existing literature and collaborating with of graduate students faculty and staff to develop the working definition of academic incivility as behavior that is offensive intimidating or hostile and which interferes with the ability to work or
then developed and administered survey in fall to our registered graduate students to assess the scope and nature of academic incivility at the of the administration and analysis of the survey cost about and was paid out of the student conflict resolution center sc rc budget
this investment was an essential part of the to the administration faculty and staff ie that destructive behavior exists in virtually every department of this university and that there are high costs to both the graduate students and the organization
the survey results also helped to legitimize and create sense of urgency around the initiative
out of the results came the message that improving the culture will benefit the community everyone can contribute to this change and we should not wait to take action
of the students who responded to the survey about reported experiencing harassing behavior
eighty three percent of those students said that it somewhat or completely kept them from performing to their ability while almost said that the behav caused them to consider leaving the university
fifteen percent of the total number of respondents reported witnessing another graduate student being harassed and half of those students changed their program adviser or classes as result of witnessing the harassment
almost third of witnesses considered leaving the university as result of the harassment they observed
after seeing the results of the survey decided that needed to take action and expand my effectiveness by trying to address the problem at the systems level
the survey results and anecdotal evidence of the sc rc case load provided strong argument to address academic incivility at the institutional level
be fore taking on such project however it was necessary to assess the capacity in terms of commitment to the goal resources and support by key colleagues to foster success
once academic incivility was identified and data collected it could be framed and reframed from the perspective of the various stake holders
after presenting the issue and gaining the support from key institutional leaders work group was formed in to develop shared vision and affect positive change
is taboo subject and there needs to be more dissemination of information and adherence to good policies concerning the way professors treat academic civility initiative work group comprised of faculty members administrators and graduate students formed of key stake holders and opinion leaders who hold the attention and the trust of their colleagues and who have the capability to connect with them to gain their commitment to positive change
participation by wellknown and respected professors deans and program chairs was essential to give the work of the group measure of legitimacy within the community
as ombudsman have established close working relationships with key problem through our work on individual cases and started building the core of the work group with those colleagues
directors of offices working with international students gl bt students and staff from the office were also included
convening the work group was done informally there was no formal nor was the goal to write new policy to be enforced
we came to see ourselves as simply responding to felt need within the community we were group of volunteers coming together to work through informal channels to promote climate that was free from academic harassment
the work group developed the following vision statement envision university culture that fosters academic excellence and promotes civil and respectful relationships through effective prevention of and response to hostile offensive or in timid at ing behavior
the work group was convened and our vision statement was adopted we agreed upon our ob to develop model to address academic incivility at the of we needed way to explore journal of the international ombudsman association morse and identify goals strategies and actions to address the issue
to help us make sense of this complex issue where everything seemed to be interconnected with everything else we used strategic mapping method
the group was able to identify specific goals related to envisioning new cultural norms around behavior building and sustaining support for the new norms throughout the university and integrating the new norms within our academic community
more details on this method can be found in the book visible thinking by john br ys on et al
to build our strategy map work group members were asked to propose action steps that would meet two criteria
the question was asked order for us to accomplish the objective of addressing academic incivility what are some actions that would first help to meet that goal and second that you are willing to work on
we were asking for everyone to contribute all of their good ideas and those ideas had to be something which they considered important enough to commit to working on themselves
the exercise garnered about ideas such as workshop for graduate students with directors of graduate study and with senate committees
each idea was written on post it note and then affixed to large sheet of paper with similar ideas grouped together
the group then discussed various options and each member voted for their top ac ti on steps
the culmination of our initial meeting was the adoption of the following slate of prioritized send letter to directors of graduate study and assistants with quick reference guide the graduate student advising guide and draft of the letter to graduate students
send letter to faculty apprising them of the work of the group asking for their help and support
present information at the new faculty orientation
develop and present an orientation session to all incoming graduate students
send letter to all graduate students the rd week of classes
develop workshop on civility for departments
present to new faculty department chairs
presentations will be made at the center for teaching and teaching enrichment series entitled in the learning environment
prepare two pod casts one for students and one for faculty that will be added to the student conflict resolution center sc rc web site
post the survey data on the sc rc web site
set up meetings with the educational policy and equity access and diversity senate committees
develop document to assist departmental chairs in handling reports of incivility
because there were only six weeks before the beginning of the academic year the group moved quickly to assign tasks to small groups of individuals
the work group met every other week for period of eight weeks to launch the initiative then kept in touch via email and met as needed over the year with total of six meetings
all action steps were completed during the academic year
list of the group members and all documents developed as well as complete survey results can be found at
ed ust aff faculty academic civility
it is interesting to note that not one of the ideas was to policy
because the group was an informal and voluntary activity for all of the par every effort was made to use our time as efficiently and effectively as possible
therefore we focused on implementation of action steps and relied on strategy of development of tools and communication with key stake holders faculty directors of graduate studies deans that offered different vision
the critical importance of positive learning and work environment was emphasized as key to the success of graduate and professional students
and the group developed tools and resources to those interested in working with us to help address the systemic problem of academic harassment
the academic civility initiative is essentially an at tempt to the existing academic culture by proposing new values setting new standards and introducing new ways to respond to longstanding problems
the initiative also invites people to commit to the best practice of civil behavior toward and among graduate students
it empowers members of the community to be personally responsible for their choices rather than to be reliant upon an external control or hierarchical directive
journal of the international ombudsman association encourage you to communicate with the highest levels of the administration they need to be leaders and are currently not doing what they must on this score
central goal of the change effort was to persuade members of the community that it was in their best interest to do their part to improve the environment for graduate students and also for themselves by promoting more civil standard of interaction
one indication of the success of this initiative is the heavy use of the materials on the sc rc web site
the academic civility page has been the most frequently referenced page over the past year than any other page on the site including the home page
in addition qualitative feedback has been obtained through ongoing conversations with members of the community
discussion of this issue has gone from being almost taboo topic to one that is being more openly acknowledged and discussed
perhaps this initiative has made contribution to the shift in dialogue
the academic civility work group is planning to review revise and administer the student survey in fall it will be informative to compare data with the fall results
and while the number of cases featuring academic harassment continues to rise the students who are coming forward are more aware of resources and options and are looking to take action rather than resigned to enduring the problematic behavior or contemplating leaving their program or the university
university must take this matter seriously
it affects many more than the faculty member and the student it affects all who have worked and will work with them in the future
institutions can do better job of protect ing graduate students from the kind of behavior that prevents them from doing their best work and its their achievements
the community has moral and ethical responsibility to do so
as ombudsmen we have the opportunity to use our knowledge and expertise to play significant role in organizations working to address the destructive forces of academic harassment
workplace harassment mediation addressing the problem behaviours compassion protocols
dis im er the views expressed in this article are the professional views of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views or policies of the university of auckland
this article is contribution to the many others available on the topic of workplace bullying it is based on my experience as practitioner rather than scientific or academic study
when you go ogle workplace bullying there are sites which come up but as most deal with aspects other than hope that this contribution will add value
the article is in two parts the first part deals with the use of me dia ti on and the second is an appendix and suggests tool for organ is at ions to use as an initial decision making tool when complaints or concerns about harassment are received
the first part of the article is based on the process have developed as mediator to deal with such concerns and complaints and as have had some success and satisfaction from that recorded it for discussion
my description is intended to be conversational rather than didactic
hope that readers may respond to me and with each other
the leg is lat iv landscape in in rel at io to harassment lay gu id my view the most relevant piece of legislation to consider is the health and safety in employment act
it sets out the following provision sa if an employer identifies hazard in the work place then the employer must take all practicable steps to remove the hazard
bullying is identified in the definition of hazards
if the hazard cannot be removed then the employer must take all practicable steps to minimise harm including psychological harm
my suggestion is that instigating prevention of bullying policy is simple practicable step which any employer regardless of size can implement
an ef fec policy should provide definition of bullying range of options to deal with concerns depending on the level of seriousness involved in the accusation and dealing with bullying behaviours in the workplace what works view barbara cc ull och journal of the international ombudsman association mc cul loch the preferences of the complainant and an ability to address the most serious cases with the most serious consequences
since part of my job description has been to devise ways of defining harassment and bullying and working to minimise the impact of this behaviour
base my conclusions on interviews and various interventions over the last years using and follow ups
in conversation with others working in similar environments think this number is probably and have included staff staff staff student and student student examples and concerns
while conclude from my own observations and the writing and studies of others that there are structural and systemic factors which make bullying behaviour more likely to occur eg there is good research available to suggest that strongly hierarchical or feudal organ is at ions are more likely to have an inherent structure which invites tolerates and supports bully ing behaviours also conclude that with some good interventions the behaviours which cause concern can be minimised despite these factors
note particularly the work which has been done by the australian defence forces to alleviate bullying within hierarchical organisation
work in def initio of harassment and bully in bullying and harassment are ways of behaving
the behaviours are unwanted and unwarranted and have detrimental impact on the targets or victims
many people who are accused of bullying would not agree that the term bullying is an accurate de scription of what they do some people do behave inappropriately without having clear idea of the impact their behaviour has on others
these people also often believe quite genuinely that they are well intentioned or doing my
however harassment is the term have used as the for the concerns referred to me as mediator
bullying which is one version of harassment involves an abuse of power and authority but is not always defined by hierarchical structures
it is of course possible to bully across hierarchical lines and rely on other than positional power to do so
however most of the cases referred to me which are allegations of bullying are hierarchical ie staff complaints of bullying from their managers
many of the cases which are referred to me are allegations of harassment as distinct from bullying
sexual and racial harassment are again subsections of harassment
interestingly there are similar numbers of sexual harassment claims from academic staff about students as there are from students about academic staff
there are greater numbers of women who complain of sexual harassment against men than vice versa
there have been very few claims of racial harassment referred to the mediation service
bullying usually occurs over time it is pattern of repeated behaviour and the pattern of behaviour usually escalates if it is not recognised and dealt with quickly
it humiliates excludes demeans offends or intimidates
it can be verbal it can occur by publication and very occasionally it can be physical
there has been noticeable increase in the last years of claims about electronic bullying and most of these allegations have occurred in the student community
while both racial and sexual harassment are defined in legislation in the human rights act and the employment relations act there is no similar definition for bullying
one of the strengths of current legislation is that the legislation actually defines some of the harassing behaviours and for clarity think that if we are to create helpful legislation it should follow these precedents and actually list some of the most common ways that bullying can occur in the workplace whilst ensuring that the codicil of rather than or incidental behaviours is stressed
it is the pattern of repeated behaviours which has the detrimental effects
in we have criminal harassment statute and various other pieces of legislation eg relating to domestic violence but none specifically pertaining to workplace bullying
one conclusion shared by various writers and contributors to this discussion is to ponder since defining the behaviour clarifying that such behaviours are not acceptable and then providing processes to address the behav io ur and minimise its repetition are shown to have the greatest positive impact
journal of the international ombudsman association mc cul loch my recommendation then is that organ is at ions be advised to adopt of policies and to provide range of nominated staff and possible interventions to deal with concerns
the policy needs to be consistent in that it should define bullying behaviours it should clarify that bullying and harassing behaviours are unacceptable and then it should seek to address the behaviours and to sup port all parties during that process
there are two main reasons for this recommendation one is so that the organisation is compliant with the health and safety in employment legislation and another is that often have high regard for authority and may therefore be less likely to use bullying tactics if policy exits to forbid it
why is it im port ant to deal wit bully in behav io urs
it may be useful to consider first why we should deal with workplace bullying and harassment as an hr manager commented bullying just another name for people who get on with each other
however there are well researched and documented articles on costs of workplace and so summarised these points to begin work places exist to be productive in some way

quote from the partner of person being bullied how to address these behav io urs what has worked in my pr act ic ea key component of addressing the bullying behaviour is to have an agreed triage stage nom in at ing range of staff and processes available
in the first instance the complainant chooses who to approach
it is often important that the original recipient has an ability to discuss the situation on an anonymous basis if necessary with another nominated staff member to ensure that as far as possible there is clinical agree ment on how to proceed
in my work this has been shown to reduce risk to both the aggrieved party the accused party and the employer
have suggested sequence of questions which can be asked not in any kind of scripted format but in more conversational tone
they enquire about what has happened how long and how often the problem behaviour occurs who else might have noticed this and what the impact is on the person reporting the concern
best practice suggests that at the end of each series of questions the interviewer summa rises with the client what they have heard and then pro ce eds having mutual understanding of the perspective
tr ia ge quest io ns what happened
do you notice that similar things happen to anyone else
what were you trying to achieve at the time
were you trying to avoid anything at the time
was there anything good in terms of what happened
summarise which values of yours do you think were
which needs or expectations of yours do you think went unmet
how do you think your sense of your identity was challenged
sometimes people find these questions quite challenging at the time but noticed they always come back with an answer at later time if that happens
summarise how might be contributing to the prob
summarise which values of theirs might have been trespassed
which needs or expectations of theirs might have gone unmet
how do you think their sense of identity might have been challenged
how might you have contributed to the problem
summarise if you were in similar situation again what might you do the same
if they were in similar position what might they do the same
journal of the international ombudsman association mc cul loch what is your best learning from this
summarise what might their best learning be
summarise in lengthy or complex situations then use narrative technique of writing to the person and summarising again what my understandings are from our discussion
once the client is happy with the written summary we then discuss the options available for dealing with the problem
in simple terms the op ti ons are to do nothing at the moment and see what happens to ask the other to come to facilitated meeting or mediation to make formal complaint or to make an external complaint
we often suggest that people seek advice prior to making decision about which process to use
have observed number of things which lead me to conclude that there are broad categories of bullying firstly there are people who behave badly at some times but who are able and willing to accept feedback apologise for any distress caused and take steps to change their behaviour
these people might behave badly on regular basis or on an occasional basis
they probably understand at some level that their behaviour is unacceptable and so they often engage in justifying thinking in order to continue the bad behaviour
they may comfort themselves when they reflect that the other person deserves to be bullied
they probably use the term but they might describe their own behaviour in other ways
however they tend to concentrate on depersonalising and defending their response in their own minds
the key requirements are the ability of the mediator to elicit insight compassion and the taking of responsibility in the accused person
secondly there is category of people for whom bullying behaviour starts out as unplanned but because it has desired effect ie desired by the person perpetrating the bullying it is learned and then re peat ed
think that we can subscribe to theory of accidental bullying over any prolonged period of time but we can probably accept that the bullying was initially at least unintended
in such situations the person accused of bullying is often stressed stuck anxious poorly trained and prepared for people management lacking emotional intelligence and feeling overwhelmed and under siege but they are still well intentioned and believe however delusional this might prove to be that they were trying to something worse from hap
again the key requirements to address and change the pattern of bullying behaviour are the skill of the mediator and the willingness of the accused person to reflect with insight compassion and responsibility
consider that there is third category which includes people who bully each other in reciprocal fashion and people who bully in chain gang fashion ie bully you so you bully someone else who bullies someone else who goes home and kicks the cat
this can easily develop into of which can then be perceived as or in the words of michelle le baron we do around
the skill of the mediator in dealing with this category of bullying be haviours and my experience is that this is by far the largest category is twofold we strive to create de sire in both parties to take responsibility for their own behaviours and to show compassion for the situation
to achieve this the notion of impartiality becomes of paramount importance
the most valuable understanding of impartiality comes from narrative context and says that impar ti ality is not neutral but non aligned being engaged with balance and showing systematic intuition
as mediators in this situation we need to keep in mind whole picture approach to greater than normal degree and we need to be willing and able to with mayer
to successfully address reciprocal bullying the mediator has to be trusted sufficiently by the parties that they are willing to become vulnerable and articulate their own failings and mistakes
to achieve this the parties have to know that such an articulation can never be used against them eg when applying for promotion or salary increase and so of course cannot be done by an hr professional
even when hr perceive themselves to be acting impartially in the individual situation they cannot be perceived as systemically impartial they will always have an on go ing relationship with the parties and they are not non aligned
address the issue of hr involvement later in the article
think it is important to acknowledge here that some people describe themselves as targets for and if we fail to assist them to change their own behaviour we collude with the future perpetrators
using or another referral to psycho journal of the international ombudsman association mc cul loch logical assistance prior to engaging in any mediation process to address bullying is an important aspect of what works
lastly there is category of people who have been described as giles st john bur ch university of auckland and to recognise that these people are different they are not stressed stuck anxious or poorly trained and prepared for people management they do not feel overwhelmed and under siege and they are certainly not well intentioned
they do lack emotional intelligence in that they lack the ability for insight and compassion and they sometimes derive pleasure and satisfaction from inflicting pain and distress on others
interestingly in most of the situations have dealt with the targets or victims of bullying will often very accurately be able to differentiate between the and the others
lacking insight and compassion workplace psychopaths are unable to complete the questions in the triage process
my suggestions for dealing with bullying behaviours in the workplace do not apply to further acknowledge that it is also possible to bully by making unsubstantiated and malicious claims of bullying against another person
am reminded of comment by justice finn in the australian supreme court who said is not workplace bullying for managers to manage
in the management of workplace bully in gt he role of hr professionals in the process of dealing with allegations of workplace bullying has been debated and discussed in various articles some of which provided resource material for this piece
it was also discussed in recent research referred to in the bibliography
one concern is that number of hr professionals and other managers simply assume that accusations of bullying are in some way code for not coping with my or get along with this and therefore disregard concerns which are raised without enquiring in an impartial manner about the concern
while there may currently be more generic use of the term bullying and while this probably does undermine the more serious cases the available re search confirms that bullying is real problem in the workplace and we need to pay attention to it at the earliest possible opportunity
responses to reports of bullying have consistently been found to be may seek assistance from hr to deal with bullying
den ce on the effectiveness of hr in dealing with bully ing is mixed
hr personnel may feel that bullying is an issue they are untrained and unprepared to deal with and may find that their role is to support management expectations rather than employee welfare
lack of effective organisational responses to counter bullying can mean that the pr ac tice is normalised as permissible
he am es harvey and tread way
not so very long ago concerns about child abuse or domestic violence were similarly ignored or treated as private and those victims often felt and sometimes still feel re victimised by this response
acknowledging that you feel bullied leaves most people feeling deeply vulnerable and ashamed few of us would put ourselves in position like this if we feeling powerless to deal with the matter ourselves and without help
admitting to another adult that someone else is bullying us cannot be an easy task so if we are informed of this we need to respond if it was and offer support
beings are so made that the ones who do the crushing feel nothing it is the person crushed who feels what is
sim one we il for this reason some research suggests that bully ing concerns are addressed at least initially through another channel than the hr channel since the hr function is structurally systemically and strategically linked to the employer and one of primary purposes is to minimise risk to the employing organisation
if we concur with this assertion then hr cannot be perceived as impartial
given that mediators and ombudsmen are impartial by definition as well as perception we can allow for concerns about bully ing to be addressed safely if they are addressed by mediation or investigation by an ombudsman and we can prevent the anxiety or perception on the part that raising the concern will at some future date increasing the hr view of someone as team or up to
larger organ is at ions can employ or separately contract mediator who is trained to deal with work place bullying issues
that in itself suggests an aware journal of the international ombudsman association mc cul loch ness of the problem and shows staff that workplace bullying will be taken seriously
acknowledgement is major first step in the process of combating the problem
actually feel that the experience of making complaint and having it ignored or brushed aside is more damaging than the bullying itself
the sense of hopelessness and powerlessness when the employer does nothing is psychologically worse than the bully ing as with the latter alone hope that it can be stopped
furthermore targets are much more likely to suffer loss of self esteem if they think that what has been done to them is acceptable
quote from person being bullied at work
from the survey indicated perceptions of the scale of the stress and bullying problem were out of line with evidence from the survey of work and wellness with most managers believing that bullying occurred infrequently in their
human resources activities related management of bullying appear inadequate in many participating
notes the urgent need for intervention research in the education and health sectors where bullying and stress appear particularly
stress and bullying in work final report to ohs steering committee professor tim bent ley et al the value added use of med ia io to deal it workplace bully in gt he suggestion that we might use mediation to deal with workplace bullying has sometimes been met by astonishment one party asked if mediating accusations of bullying meant that they would agree to being bullied on mondays wednesdays and every second friday
however someone else in that group announced that for her this would be big improvement and she would agree to that
so classic issue based mediation is not what am recommending
instead use the term in the context of mediator remaining non aligned and compassionate facilitating safe process assisting parties to address real concerns and to find mutually agreed solutions
it also implies that that mediator is trained in working with these problems can work with high emotion can provide actual safety and is flexible enough to parties about bullying behaviour and its impact
in much the same way that mediators can educate parties in family mediation about the impact of fighting and hostility on the children
in the successful or somewhat successful mediations to deal with workplace bullying have considered the following format and acknowledge that this relates to an ideal world rather than always an actual being able to confidently rely upon support from the employing organisation for the mediation pro cess
being able to confidently rely upon an agreed set of protocols with who understand the triage process and work with the mediator to categorise as well as possible what kind of bullying behaviours are involved and how best to approach the problem
relying on parts of the including hr to do their job effectively if mediation is not considered to be the best approach
when mediation is considered to be the best ap proach meeting separately usually more than once with each party and to have sufficient resources available to deal with the issue
using co mediation to ensure that everyone involved is carefully assisted to deal with the issues
maintaining until the parties are willing to meet directly and using form of to maintain safety
using an hr manager to hr advice to all and or to implement any disciplinary procedures which may be required if the matter is deemed to be sufficiently serious or if party de clines to attend mediation or subverts the mediation process
ensuring that access to additional support eg counselling is available for any party who needs this
narrative philosophy is useful for helping people who are in victim villain life stories who tell tales and who have lost sight of solution focussed outcomes or who have lost contact with and the role of time passing to create new perspective
again stress that this approach is not helpful if you have identified that the accused person is someone you consider might be
while much of the research available concentrates on and advocates for singular approach to bullying where behaviour is named as bullying my ap proach is different
journal of the international ombudsman association mc cul loch as an analogy it occurs to me that if for example someone accused me of being my most likely response would be to deny this and defend myself
could carry on this defence to an extreme level of litigiousness
the and process will be counter productive because any insight might have in secret moments will be firmly squashed down at any cost
being accused of is likely to have the same impact and result in the same defensive behav io urs
few of us will respond constructively to such an accusation because of the shameful and one dimensional attribution involved
however if am asked to reflect on specific behav io ur especially if it can be described in factual and observable terms am much more likely to allow my insight to prevail even if initially deny it
if for example someone says to me concerned that you have left your children unsupervised at night while you go out and wondering if something going on for you
then much more likely to my situation and be open to any help or assistance that may be offered
similarly if someone says to me concerned that at our last three meetings you have shouted at and been very critical of her time keeping in public is something going on here
that might also be more open to constructive discussion
having this information of course is dependent on using good triage process and gaining good information
it is also dependent on an approach of enquiry for benefit rather than disciplinary hearing of or to the approach of someone by taking their side and being partial to their version of the problem story
in this scenario victims stay victims villains stay villains and except that each side recruits believers and engages in wider and more destructive process
in my discussions with people who raise concerns about bullying behaviour am impressed by the numbers who specify that want to get into too much trouble but want him to apologise and stop
we then ensure that they as complainants feel supported and respected if we then keep them safe and as far as possible follow their desired process we can often achieve satisfaction
if we also manage to maintain respectful and compassionate relationship with the accused person despite the accusation my experience is that this in itself is useful
the value of compass io how to stay compass io nate wit hout col lud in gp ro fess or kenneth cloke writes beautifully about this and asks the question can we be compassionate without colluding
he concludes that the best and most compassionate approach is one which is on the people and hard on the problem
it implies the notion that we are all human beings who can support each other in our humanness and struggle for integrity despite disagreement or disapproval of certain behaviours or attitudes
if someone feels stuck and comes to me as mediator for assistance or simply to feel heard and give my time and listen to them am showing them compassion
if then ask gentle questions which open up their thinking and have them reflect differently am showing even greater compassion
if do this without judging them as human beings but ask them to consider different way of being in the particular circumstances they describe am showing them even greater compassion
if that person then has an ability to go away and do that for another human being even one they were previously at odds with or in conflict with we have greater compassion in the world
have sometimes shown this to friends as figure
in the top circle show compassion to another
the other then stops being is able to flow and can go away prepared to show the same compassion to another in the bottom circle the compassion has occurred
if hear story of being bullied from one person or group of people and listen with compassion they are likely to feel better
if then ask the to hear their distress about the behaviour and ask the to reflect on how that might be and what they intend to achieve and how they might achieve that intention in better way and listen to their intention with compassion they are also likely to both feel better themselves and to engage more constructively with their and to modify their behaviour
they may even explain their intention and apologise sincerely for their unintended impact
more compassionate culture exists at that point in time
journal of the international ombudsman association mc cul lochi need to stress that this approach works best with individuals in conflict with each other and less well with individuals in conflict with organ is at ions
or gan is at ions tend to be immersed in and familiar with focussed which rely on power and rights based approach to problem solving and winning losing binaries rather than focussed this is possibly because organ is at ions are anxious about being sued or because that is indicative of an
enc our age organ is at ions to try the mediation process when faced with accusations of systemic workplace bullying or cultures of bullying because the process works few people want to leave their place of work especially in straightened economic times or when there are few choices of employers available eg in academia or in smaller locations
this has led to the notion of the organisation as bully in which organ is at ions are not necessarily seen as the cause of the bullying but as conducting bullying directly buy means of their power structures as org ani sation al interests conflict with those of individuals
in this view organisational bullying facilitates inter per son al
is possible that stress leads to bullying and bullying leads to stress
stress and bullying in final report to ohs steering committee
professor tim bent ley et al and had concern that the employer would either just support the bully because he was higher up in the system or that they would try to use us as bait to catch him
felt like there was tiger loose in the jungle and we were about to become the goats tethered to stake
quote from complainant working with individuals within an organisation can however over time influence the or as noble describes it building one person at
of course this approach takes time and skill to achieve
my response is that it is better to put re sou rc es into peace making because then you need to spend them on peace keeping
it is also important to keep in mind wider anti bullying legislation can impose societal constraints and require organ is at ions to intervene simply terminating abrasive leaders will not solve the problem of workplace abuse they will only go on to work and cause distress elsewhere
despite our understanding that domestic abuse towards children spouses and elders requires comprehensive ap proach encompassing legislation and rehabilitative help for abusers why has it taken so long to apply this same thinking to workplace abuse
coaching abrasive leaders louise craws haw some detractors use this as reason to not engage in mediation process
they want quick fix despite the fact that the problem situation is often long standing
often these people have no idea how long and protracted litigation can be or sometimes they like to feel as if they are standing on unfamiliar ground
your or taking an aggressively defensive stance can be so response that it goes unquestioned
advocate for this value added approach because in my view it works better and saves resources time money
it also preserves and enhances relationships
it saves costs in recruiting new staff
again this is especially important in an industry like tertiary education where there are very few employers and so the preservation and enhancement of relationships may be of greater importance
it requires people to function at very high level of emotional intelligence
once this kind of functioning is practised it becomes more normal and therefore cultural change occurs
it increases the compassion quotient in the world
some of my thinking has been motivated by the writ ing from the arb inger institute
some of my thinking and practice has been motivated by the writing of kenneth cloke and bernie me yer
some of my think ing and practice comes from studying the method of
am aware that none of the strategies have pro posed will work with the small but dangerous percentage of the population we might describe as
acknowledge that without insight there can be no compassion and that people who lack insight are highly unlikely to change
they journal of the international ombudsman association mc cul loch are unable to take responsibility
their presence in work places creates legal and human problems
the methods suggest are not successful in dealing with these people or their victims
the assessment of these people as is somewhat subjective although anyone who has met psychopath can identify them as such
in an organisation which understands the phenomenon of workplace bullying there may be greater opportunity for structural response
in work places which understand the phenomenon advise people to leave if at all possible
remain hopeful when consider that only one generation ago we dealt badly with domestic violence and child abuse and now we deal with it better
wonder if perhaps there is connection between the two given the increased number of hours many of us spend at work and the increased amount of stress resulting from work expectations
consider that there are strong parallels between domestic violence and workplace bullying but topic needing more research and consideration
aware of the arguments against using mediation to resolve allegations of workplace bullying
clear that are factor in mediation but would argue that this is almost always the case
aware that there are strong arguments to say that mediation risks re victimising the victim and my response is that victim villain binaries are usually unhelpful in analysing and resolving problems
remain convinced that the methods have described do in my experience deal with the vast majority of workplace bullying situations despite the risks
hopeful that my thoughts on this contribute in meaningful way
the purpose of this tool is to assist the person who first hears the concern or complaint to decide which process is likely to be best prevent the situation from address the concerns of the allow the respondent ie the person complained about their rights to consider the needs of the university where consider the likely level of seriousness involved and therefore the risks involved to the parties and to the university
the complainant makes choice when they first approach someone for help to trust you and therefore in the first instance we need to consider what kind of confidentiality we can offer in making this decision and communicating it to the complainant we need to consider the what is my role here
who if anyone do need to inform
how do clarify this with the complainant so that they can choose whether or not to continue to talk with me or to take the matter up with another person
who might refer them to if am not the most ap propria te person
if during the course of the initial conversation it arises that you have or may have conflict of inter est this needs to be disclosed immediately to the complainant who needs to be referred on and any notes which have been taken then need to be de stroyed and replaced by note which reads came to see me today about concern complaint and during the course of listening to them discovered conflict of interest
disclosed this fact to person and referred them to have destroyed all notes from the conversation
of the international ombudsman association mc cul loch
providing that you are an appropriate person to hear the initial concern or complaint the following process can be listen to the person without making any judge men ts but reflecting asking questions and summarising what you write up notes and send them to the complainant for once the notes are accurate from the perspective of the complainant and then set out their options for dealing with the matter
the options would include the being coached to deal with the matter themselves self help attending an assisted dispute resolution making formal complaint and doing nothing at this point
there is always an option of whether the matter needs to be referred to another authority eg if the allegations are criminal
the complainant always has the option of taking their concern to another authority eg the or era
the procedures for each option should be discussed with the complainant who then gives their preference
as far as possible we would prefer that any internal processes available can be used prior to using an external process for resolution
if you have different preference for dealing with the matter than the complainant you can advise them of this but only when there is clear and identified risk involved can you your over theirs
before you do this you should consult with another recipient eg if you are an hr person you should consult with recipient from outside of hr if you are mediation person you should consult with someone from outside of mediation and so on
the purpose of this step is to ensure that two different consider the issue
if two people from different disciplines consult and agree that there is good reason to override the preferences then further meeting with the complainant and both discipline representatives needs to occur
the complainant is invited to the meeting the purpose of the meeting is clarified and the complainant is invited to bring support person or representative prior to attending
if the complainant still disagrees with your recommendation then further consultation should occur this time including external legal advisors or at the university the registrar in his role as general counsel
in general terms only where there is serious risk to either person or to the university can preferences be over ridden
once the decision about the process to be used has been made then the matter should be brought to the attention of the respondent and the steps above repeated
if the complainant has preferred an pro cess and the respondent does not agree to take part in good faith then the consequences of that need to be discussed eg if this is not resolved informally formal complaint may be lodged and investigated and taking part in that process is not voluntary
if there is no agreement to an informal process then the complainant needs to be informed and make decision about whether or not to make formal complaint
if formal complaint is made it be received within days of the incident which caused be in writing and signed by the name the respondent and state the nature of the name any other people who may be state the preferred outcome
any formal complaint must be investigated and any investigator must be completely impartial
in university setting if an hr person investigates complaint they should not be attached to the faculty in which the complaint arises
in some countries an ombudsman can be called upon to investigate complaint but in ombudsmen only become involved after all of the available internal processes have been exhausted and dissatisfaction still exists
in serious cases and as far as possible there should be two investigators
the role of the investigators is to firstly decide whether either or both parties need to have safety procedures invoked or need to be suspended journal of the international ombudsman association mc cul loch during the investigation and then to hear all of the information and consider there is on the balance of probabilities sufficient information to uphold the complaint there is insufficient evidence to uphold the complaint the complaint is unfounded the complaint is malicious
based on their conclusions the investigators then make recommendation to the decision ers
the recommendation should be one or more of the an apology be made and the parties be referred back to training and or counselling be undertaken by either both disciplinary action be imposed on either or both other people need to be informed
the decision makers are under no obligation to follow the recommendations of the investigators but they should consider the that the parties are entitled to copy of the what reasons they have for not following the how to communicate their reasons to the parties
timeliness is essential to provide service which as far as possible creates safety for all concerned allows any to be exercised but which treats the matters raised with the degree of urgency required
restoration of respectful and functioning relationships and productive work habits needs to be priority
availability of time would therefore be mary consideration when considering which process to use and or who to appoint as investigators
the following time frame would be initial appointments to meet with complainant within working days and maximum of working days be allowed in any situation where matter is urgent an appointment should be pro within hours
if this time frame cannot be met consider referring the complainant to another recipient
notes of the initial conversation should be for warded in confidence to the complainant within working days
the respondent should be notified of the concern or complaint as soon as the notes are confirmed and the complainant has chosen their preferred process
in situations where there is potential difficulty eg the recipient has good reason to disagree with the preferences the out lined should take priority and be concluded within working days
in any investigation set of conclusions and recommendations should be available to the parties and decision makers within one month if not then message to all parties explaining the delays and set ting new reporting date must be provided
decision must be made and delivered to the parties within working days with further days allowed for any submissions from the parties to be considered
once final decision has been made it should be action ed and all parties need to have closing statement eg you are aware an investigation was completed and the conclusions and recommendations from that have been provided
the decision of the university is and under the provisions of the employment relations act any further information is confidential between the employee and the university as employer
after weeks call or appointment should be scheduled to either the or provide further support or intervention which may be required
any internal process should have right of appeal in university situations to the vice chancellor within specified time frame
in other organ is at ions the right of appeal can exist to whoever has final decision ing authority
all internal decisions can of course be reviewed or reconsidered by an external authority eg court or ombudsman or tribunal

ombudsman bullying corporate workplace culture australia in io we believe some of the reported research findings in australia as many as per cent of employees are currently being bullied or have been bullied in the past
thirty eight per cent indicated that the bullying activity had occurred for periods longer than six months
of the remaining sample just over per cent claim they will have witnessed workplace bullying
even if only half of these figures are true these are staggering numbers
the labour council of new south wales australia claims that workplace bullying is the number one occupational health and safety issue in new south wales
as corporation that has many work places in australia including two in the state of new south wales why as an ombudsman for this company have not seen these high levels of bullying
to be able to answer this better have reviewed firstly what workplace bullying is and and secondly when it is most likely to occur
using this information as reference have compared what our corporation does in relation to these factors and how believe this contributes to lessening but from experience not eliminating the opportunity for workplace bullying in our organisation
although this is an australian definition have seen similar definitions for other parts of the western world
bullying means any behaviour that is repeated systematic and directed towards an employee or group of employees that reasonable person having regard to the circumstances would expect to victimise humiliate undermine or threaten and which creates risk to health and safety
view from the corporate world mim gae tano journal of the international ombudsman association gae tano unpacking this definition there are four key elements that are important to recognise workplace bullying has its origins in work place conflict ii it is repeated in nature and can be long lasting iii it is inappropriate behaviour that can be aggressive iv it results in level of physical andor cho logical distress that can linger long after the bullying has ceased examples of workplace bully in behaviour can be obvious such as abusive or offensive language right up to criminal activity such as physical assaults or unlawful threats
it is this type of behaviour that often springs to mind when we think of bullying
however workplace bullying can also be subtle and may include behaviour such as deliberately excluding person from normal workplace activities or intimidating person through inappropriate personal comments or unjustified criticism
and finally covert behaviour that undermines treats less favourably or dis empowers others is also bully ing
examples of this would be overloading person with work setting time lines that are very difficult to achieve or unfair treatment in relation to accessing workplace entitle men ts such as leave or training
what is not workplace bully in
according to the act the following does not constitute workplace bullying
reasonable action taken in reasonable manner by an to transfer demote discipline counsel retrench or dismiss an to not award or provide promotion transfer or benefit in connection with an employ to carry out reasonable administrative duties in relation to that employment how does bully in dif fer from mo bb in
there are many similarities in bullying and mob bing behaviours and the resulting impacts but there is very important differentiator between the two
bullying involves the inappropriate behaviour of one person toward another person or groups of people
mobbing on the other hand is the inappropriate behaviour of group of people toward one person the victim
why does workplace bully in occur
there are variety of reasons why person may bully another person in the workplace
these reasons may inc lu dei pow era bully abuses their power to hurt demean or take advantage of others who do not feel they are in position to protect themselves
for bullying to occur both parties have to perceive the disparity of power and the paucity of alternatives
these are generally people who are weaker insecure or feel they fight back whatever their reasons
that power can often be used in some of the following
ii self esteem bullies may put down others to boost their own self esteem and confidence to help deal with personal feelings of inadequacy
iii difference an individual or group may become targets of work place bullying because others perceive them as being new or different
iv perceived threat some people bully others because the other person is perceived as threat to them personally or threat to their position within the company
organisational culture the culture of workplace is often shown by its values beliefs and what is considered to be normal be haviour
if the inappropriate behaviours and attitudes are encouraged or condoned by management then bullying is seen as normal behaviour for the majority of the workplace
journal of the international ombudsman association gae tano vi organisational factors people may harass or bully others due to dis satis fac ti on with organisational factors such as job insecurity restructuring or downsizing change in ownership or poor skills and practices in people management
vii working arrangements some working arrangements have individual employ or work groups separated from supervisors and others in the workplace
this can allow bullying to go undetected and prevent effective monitoring and leadership
what does our company do that helps in im is workplace bully in
the above seven factors give us reasons workplace bullying occurs so they can also be used as guides as to needs to be done to stop the practice
will review them through the lens of typical workplace in our corporation
the first four factors of self esteem difference and perceived all link to our ways of work ing
our corporation has strong belief in what we call the associate concept
our employees are called and there is strong egalitarian approach to working relationships
we have very flat organisation structures which minimise the power available to managers
part of the associate concept speaks strongly about treating each other with dignity and respect irrespective of race religion age or gender
of course putting words together to demand certain behaviours is the easy part
ensuring those behav io urs becomes the fabric of the organisation in its day to day workings is much harder to achieve
this requires significant efforts especially by those in management positions
our company is very much values driven cor po ration with distinct and unique culture
it places huge importance on its people and demands very inclusive ways of working especially from its managers
bullying behaviour is so at odds with this culture that when it does occur it can be very obvious and so can be addressed early on
there is also significant investment in time and resources towards training and development of our people especially in our unique culture and expectations of behaviour as company associate
in australia there are regular training sessions for all associates to ensure there is clear understanding on what is and acceptable behaviour
our senior managers are expected to role model these behaviours and take seriously any allegations of improper behaviours
it is made very clear through these sessions as well as through disciplinary measures that improper behaviour will not be tolerated
was the sixth element of reasons why bullying occurs
we pride ourselves on hav ing very open internal communication channels
any level of management is available to all our associates to discuss debate or challenge whatever is on their minds
there are regular communications on business updates and the frequencies of these communications are increased in times of significant change such as re organ is at ions acquisitions or expansion activities
where possible and practical every effort is made to keep our associates up to date with factors that impact their workplace
we understand the importance of people in the cess of any business and so we go to great lengths to ensure we attract train and retain high calibre associates into our business
key element of the training is not just on technical functional delivery of their roles but also on the softer people skills that are required to fully engage and motivate their teams
the final reason for bullying mentioned above was
long standing practice at our sites is the open plan office
typical office will have the desks of the general managers and their teams positioned in the middle of the office sur rounded by the desks of their respective functional teams
in this layout it would be quite difficult for any obvious workplace bullying to occur
what else is needed to stop workplace bully in
all the activities mentioned above are certainly important in helping to eradicate the bullying pr ac tice
however life is never perfect especially when you are dealing with people
so even with all the above there is still need for both formal and informal an ce procedures to be in place so that any workplace bullying can be reported investigated and action ed
journal of the international ombudsman association gae tano formal grievance procedures that have the option to escalate grievances where necessary are very imp or ta nt
however due to the sensitivity of many bullying incidents wherever possible the agreed procedures for investigations should be conducted as informally as possible in confidence and with fair procedures to minimise conflict and stress for the individuals involved
why is an ombudsman channel so im port ant here
given the nature of the behaviours and in par ticul ar the high likelihood for retaliation it is imp or ta nt to have informal channels as well
this is where an internal ombudsman can really make difference
whilst an ombudsman is able to capture feedback on all forms of workplace bullying it can be vitally important in capturing the subtle and covert forms of bullying that will generally not be seen by witnesses
these forms rely on the person being bullied to raise the complaint in some fashion
as noted above victims of workplace bullying are likely to be suffering some form of psychological impact due to the bully ing and the thought of going through formal channel can be quite daunting
fears of retaliation and job insecurity can exacerbate the psychological trauma
for example research shows that the action deemed most successful by respondents to dealing with bullying was to no or new
it is here that the confidential element of the ombudsman channel plays huge role in helping to surface these types of bullying
it can be the safe haven that they need to help them work through their options
our corporation has well established formal grievance procedures and an ombudsman channel has been in place now for the past years
in my time as an ombudsman have certainly had to deal with workplace bullying and undoubtedly key driver to why the employee was raising the issue with me was the fact that they felt talking to me
another positive element of an ombudsman channel with workplace bullying is the element of their roles
the ombudsman has the potential to identify any in an organisation be it par ticul ar person particular department or particular site earlier than might be the case with the formal channels
as mentioned above there is likelihood that not all bullying will be reported via the formal channels
so with fewer examples to consider the ability of these formal channels to identify these early on can be limited
having the confidential channel available is likely to encourage more employees to speak up which in turn provides more examples of the bullying which in turn can surface the practice earlier
having the extra examples can also be used to strengthen the feedback and recommendations for change back to the organisation
for example employee is working on the night shift and is being systematically bullied at work by two of his co work ers
being on night shift the practice is not readily visible to management who work during the day
employee is suffering stress depression and anxiety attacks and his work performance is starting to suffer but he cannot bring himself to report the behaviour
he resigns because he take it anymore but gives the reason that found another job that suits him better
having left and started working somewhere else he summons up the courage to contact the ombudsman from the previous company and relays the real reason why he left
he just wanted to make sure that no one else would have to go through what he went through
unbeknownst to employee his story is now the second the ombudsman has heard of similar behaviours from that site and so with the approval of the contact is able to use this added information to strengthen the recommendations to management on what can be done to address the behaviours
workplace bullying is prevalent in our work places and is serious issue
it can cost corporations significantly in lost time and money due to absenteeism staff turnover medical costs and legal settlements
with the current challenging corporate times of acquisitions down sizings out sou rc in gs and increased competitive pressures the stage is set for increased levels of workplace bullying
corporations that want to address this issue are encouraged to take holistic approach and consider implementing tools and practices that address the various reasons as to why workplace bullying occurs
this will involve journal of the international ombudsman association clear and decisive top down approach that bullying will not be tolerated ii adequate training and education of all employees on what is and bullying iii review of current practices including work ing arrangements that might be harbouring workplace bullying iv the establishment or beefing up of both formal and informal channels of communication and grievance procedures that employees feel to use
given the unique attributes of an ombudsman especially the confidentiality aspect an ombudsman channel is an ideal dare say it an essential channel for any organisation that seriously wants to tackle workplace bullying

power harassment bullying workplace ombudsman sang yo counselor japan in december the japan industrial counselors association ji ca conducted survey about work place bullying gathering the responses of industrial counselors
industrial counselors are not always independent counselors as with an employee assistance program
some industrial counselors are hr staff or managers in the organization
japan industrial counselors association ji ca founded in offers training courses seminars and certification exams
industrial counselors needs to take certain training courses and pass the certification exams
industrial counselors support workers to solve the issues problems which they have by themselves
industrial counselors specially work for areas
according to the result of this survey of the industrial counselors were approached about work place bullying concerns
the issues raised included the following power harassment
bullying caused by human relationship conflict bullying against people who made mistakes low performance and sexual harassment
the types of bullying behaviors included using profanity yelling and intimidating ignoring and excluding and making someone feel bad
eighty five percent of survey respondents received concerns about bosses bullying subordinates
fifty six percent heard concerns about bully ing among colleagues and forty three percent heard bullying concerns that were between members of the same sex
in japan is well known expression as one form of workplace bulling
the phrase was created by ya su ko ok ada in
she defined that person exerts the status and power of their position over an employee by demanding per form an ce exceeding the original job description through continual verbal nonverbal abuse aimed at destroying character and dignity damaging the work environment or pressuring the employee to quit or get fired
power refers not always to managers and subordinates ranking difference
sometimes subordinates have more information or longer experience in certain field than their bosses then subordinates have more power than their bosses
journal of the international ombudsman association tad aor labor management related personnel
one focus of this survey was what barriers prevent addressing and solving the workplace bullying problem
thirty percent of the time according to these respondents the assailant did not admit his her bullying behaviors and of the time top management and managers did not cooperate with efforts to improve or change the situation
in the case of alleged harassment it is report ed that managers often justify their behaviors toward subordinates and they believe that their behaviors are not power harassment but necessary training education
for example mr was overpowering his assistant ms because of that mr who was the boss of mr tried to stop mr from misusing power over ms however mr behavior did not change
so mr started to overpower mr and escalate to ward power harassment
however mr believed that this was reasonable exercising of authority over his subordinate not power harassment
this dynamic can be seen in situations in which employees have low performance and make errors in their job duties
supervisors begin to try to improve that employee with strict training which escalates into power harassment however the supervisor sees his behavior as training designed to improve the performance and support the goals of the organization
when the manager believes that there are good reasons for their behaviors toward their subordinates even though their behaviors are not effectively improving the situation and even though subordinates suffer mentally it may be difficult to stop the behaviors
the manager may believe his or her be haviors should be accepted and support the organization but the negatively affected subordinates believe that the behaviors should not be accepted
moreover how do people around them think about it
the consequences of behaviors for those around them are very important
the actions of bystanders may make all the difference
responses can influence unacceptable behavior either to escalate or calm down
in one situation colleague in the same department tried to go between people in dispute and let them calm down on the spot
some colleagues took care of the person who was overwhelmed by his her boss others will sometimes even try to take care of the boss
if those responses happened many times the behavior and the dispute would not escalate
the group depart ment will have taken care of their group dynamic
however if people around them closed their eyes and ignored it targeted subordinate may become iso lated allowing the manager to escalate the bullying behavior
worst case scenarios sometimes arise when people around the target join the boss and create alleged mobbing situations
they justify their behavior by pointing to the behavior as permission
this joining also let the manager justify his her behavior
if no one in the group stops it the behavior spirals out of control causing an ever widening circle of damage
certain behaviors that were ac cep ted years ago are not accepted now
depending on the kind of relationship people have each behavior is perceived to have different meaning
there are no clear common shared criteria yet
this is one of the reasons it is difficult to cope with claims of unacceptable behavior
as om buds we need to look beyond right wrong
the survey asked question what are the characteristics of the workplace which had bullying
multiple answers were given lack of communication among employees lack of management skills of managers more individual work than group work change from seniority based payment system to result performance based payment system overloaded work situation high rates of turnover through resignation or transfer
some ways to address this behavior are to improve variety of skills communication skills relationship building skills and management skills of leadership
why is communication among employees important
bullying and power harassment are also issues of the better the communication the greater the trust between employees
further more communication builds relationship among employees
journal of the international ombudsman association tad at he survey said that managers should have leadership skills to help them cope with bullying situations ef fec
what kind of management skills are needed in these situations
how can an organization recognize the necessary skills
what can organizations do to support managers
the issue of recognizing and pro vi ding these management skills is an organizational issue
the organization also has responsibility and does have options to alleviate the damage bullying can do
the ji ca survey results highlighted the tendency in japanese organizations to use transfer as solution to the problem
employees except for certain assisting workers are regularly transferred as part of manage ment strategy
the point of the transfer in bullying situation is to keep the parties from communicating with each other
sometimes this approach works very well
however it does not always resolve the problem
some people do not want to be transferred
some people may face similar situations again in the next place or if the organization is small there is no place to transfer to
when the people involved trust communication and choose to communicate with each other second op ti on is available
shuttle diplomacy or mediation will be useful options
it should not be over looked that bullying and power harassment effect mental health and in the worst cases it is possible to lead to suicide
october saw the first legal case in japan which recognized the relationship between suicide and power harassment
the district court of tokyo accident compensation insurance
when cope with alleged bullying and power harassment try to find ways to keep any person from being isolated in the organization while try to find options for him her
even though it is difficult to cope with workplace bullying it has to receive attention and resolution
as an om buds am struggling with the challenges posed in each case and trusting it can be transformed by all parties involved

crystal ball organizational ombudsman predicting problems organizational change disruptive prob le ms wisdom of crowds acknowledgements the author would like to thank david miller and three anonymous reviewers for their wisdom and considerable help with this article
the crystal ball began in primarily as an aid to organizational ombudsmen oos in anticipating how to deal with specific conflicts
the crystal ball in addition has turned out to be an important example of additional functions of an and additional aspects of effectiveness identifying and assessing new concerns and conflicts and areas for systems change as well as helping to deal with specific problems
identify concerns especially those that seem to be to the organization or unrecognized by the organization and especially disruptive concerns assess concerns provide timely information to managers in ways consonant with confidentiality help to resolve and manage concerns as appropriate followup on specific concerns as appropriate help to support systems change to prevent problems in the past many employers simply hoped that oos would help in managing specific conflicts
some still just consider oos as an mechanism
however in modern times many employers are looking to oos for help in identifying assessing and communicating concerns that are new to the organization
some times the concerns are not really new but the organization has not yet begun to deal with the given issue
journal of the international ombudsman association ro we modern employers are especially asking for help in swift identification of new disruptive and illegal concerns and conflicts
they need early warning of prob le ms that can be addressed through interest based channels as well as through formal channels
the crystal ball has been feature of many organizational om buds conferences for more than twenty five years
this article presents the history of crystal ball discussions and an illustration of the modern day broader significance of the crystal ball
it also includes nonscientific list of topics picked up by om buds professionals over the years topics that appeared to oos to be to their organizations or largely unrecognized by their organizations
the crystal ball began in as several oos sat planning the first sizable corporate ombudsman association conference
the group talked about topics where oos thought they needed to know more from each other
as an early example of the of and as delightful example of the crystal ball itself since om buds were seeking about the future very early on oos decided to put together what they were seeing
it quickly be came apparent that om buds professionals were picking up some problems very early in their organizations and that this might be useful to their managers and others
there has been much discussion about how and why om buds practitioners are proving useful in picking up new things
we believe we are sometimes able to do this because we strive to be practitioners safe and accessible
and we sometimes can do this be cause we are one of the few offices with view of the whole organization
at times of increasing complexity when many senior officers have become specialists or regional experts the may be able to pick up small bits of information from all over the organization and fit them together in pattern before the pattern is obvious to everyone
and of course one of the pur poses of oos is to be scanning the organization for good ideas and good practices to share
over time oos learned that it is especially important to be on the lookout for any new issue that might be disruptive to an organization in terms of needing new policy new procedures or structures
in the crystal ball issues were collected by word of mouth and telephone calls and on the basis of consulting calls from practitioners who wanted to discuss some new problem
since the advent of the worldwide web have sent out an annual query to organizational om buds around the world to ask about and about issues the profession will face in the coming year
as om buds responded have typically sent out further queries about issues that seemed especially interesting to those who wrote in
in there were great many responses to the crystal ball query
and in there was to the responses
along with sadness and grief and concern about the state of the world om buds appeared to have dug their heels in resiliently deter mined to work for better world
at least om buds of the hundred plus respondents described systems initiatives where they were working with in house colleagues to address one or major issues
om buds association org conference crystal ball
it appears that the task in conflict management see conflict management tasks above has become more important
few top ic as in formally recalled by un it ed states organ at io ombudsmen at the turn of the century tried to remember when had first heard of an issue in my office
started with my own first list from
at times of increasing complexity then sent the list to long term oos for additions and comments
the list below was drawn from informal recollections from many oos
some issues of course had been well known for years but oos have helped to illuminate and even to name few issues like micro inequities sexual harassment and integrated conflict management system and to encourage organizations to establish policies and procedures to deal with them
journal of the international ombudsman association sexual and racial harassment antisemitism por no graphy offensive ethnic images racial assault and sexual assault homophobic discrimination advisories for of discrimination many kinds of civility and free speech concerns in rapidly changing subtle and covert discrimination which were dubbed mentor ing systems which were found to be built on networks of minorities and of women also built on affirmative action and job posting systems in organizations equal pay for equal work equal pensions for men and women with the same record of nonexempt staff issues professional job titles safety in the office respect privacy compensation career cafeteria benefits flexible work hours shared jobs leave without pay voluntary furloughs for example for employees to take exams many dependent care issues parental leave support for adoption day care elder care illegal drugs and designer concerns about the welfare of low income students and workplace and supervisory abuse and mistreat ment issues later called managers who would not or could not deal with human resource issues graduate student and post doc mistreatment coordinated nonunion dispute resolution later called management systems and conflict management systems

privacy issues and cruel interpersonal attacks have become much more serious with the advent of the inter net and social networking
lack of resources and deferred maintenance have led to many difficulties with service and costly errors
there are now many more cases with multiple cohorts and many issues with people from different eth nici ties languages tribal and clan groups races genders ages and various generations involving inconsistent laws and regulations across multiple national and organizational boundaries and long term conflicts
there are more anonymous cases and group cases
boundaries appear to be blurring with more problems coming in from people outside the organization and members of the organization concerned with outsiders
bullying and mobbing issues and high tech crimes some sophisticated covert and vicious are reported worldwide
look in back and look in forward crystal ball reports now appear to have several purposes and several functions
these reports help each with the conflict management tasks de scribed above
and they help to affirm the usefulness of the om buds profession
crystal ball reports help to demonstrate the wisdom of having safe place in organizations to express concerns place for members of an organization to say early on what is giving rise to worry and what vulnerabilities are being endured
the platform of principles upon which the resides is what makes this possible
crystal ball reports have reflected vital societal concerns whether they relate to gender human rights or cafeteria policies
computer related issues emerged as early as when the newfangled started becoming more avail journal of the international ombudsman association ro we able in work and study places
the crystal ball reports through the decades have anticipated and reflected technological and other societal develop men ts
for example health aids mental health stress depression ideo lo and interpersonal issues gender religion and race micro inequities religious harassment affirmative action bullying intellectual property in issues waste fraud fabrication plagiarism and all academic and research misconduct crimes of all kinds computers and the internet computer crime pornography cy ber bullying job security international vulnerabilities cynicism economic fear and want in ter nationalism economic interdependence cross cultural dependence the crystal ball has benefits for organizations collective wisdom provides for policy lacunae and defects and development collective wisdom enables oos to share and learn from each other when facing new challenges to assess issues and to share good ideas and good practice the crystal ball supports oos to give early warning to organizations about what matters to its workforce and enables evidence based data for policy development collective wisdom enables organizations to take more timely action where structural and administrative responses may be advisable
crystal ball discussions illuminate ideas and methods that are working well
oos are sleuths weather vanes periscopes and diviners
the structure and principles of the office make divination of future issues possible
we become repositories of organizational vulnerability and can more easily detect future vulnerabilities as result
and we can see and share what is going right when the organization may be consumed with what went wrong
the platform of principles upon which the rests may actually in view of the crystal ball outputs be more of springboard
by showing where initiatives are required to ensure difficult situations are responded to appropriately the also has in the crystal ball an impetus for broader professional evolution
our relevance is determined in part by the degree to which we can engage with our organizations
the crystal ball is more than mirror of discontent for the alert compleat ombudsman the crystal ball collective gift from oos to oos may help us also to divine our future professional directions
endnotes there are of course very few concerns that are really brand new in the world
an may however identify concerns that an organization appears not have dealt with before
it is especially important to take note of concerns that may be disruptive for managers and employees
laws and policies often follow behind changes in norms technology values and problems
oos can sometimes help with swift identification
there had been only small meetings of in and in the summer of
was precursor of the ombudsman association which in turn then became the international ombudsman association
raised several issues fear of people with and unusual religious complaints
said had maintained list since of issues that appeared to be at least somewhat new to my organization this list appears below
carole tr oc ch io the from southland corporation who at the same meeting proposed the code of ethics which has largely stood the test of time immediately called for at all conferences
she suggested that it was important for all os to identify and communicate problems that appeared to be new to our organizations
wi kipe dia describes this concept in this way the wisdom of the crowd refers to the process of taking into account the collective opinion of group of individuals rather than single expert to answer question
this process while not new to the information age has been pushed into the mainstream spotlight by social information sites such as wi kipe dia and yahoo
answers and other web resources that rely on human opinion
this process in the business world at least was written about in detail by james su ro wi ec ki in his book the wisdom of crowds
this list has been substantially corrected revised and edited from an earlier list sketched out in

the importance of relationships for om bud person stim gr if in organizational om buds persons have wide array of documents that establish their offices and define their roles
these charters mission statements andor job descriptions typically describe the role of the ombudsperson in manner consistent with the values and needs of the organization
in addition professional organizations like the international ombudsman association delineate codes of ethical behavior and standards of practice which further clarify the ap propria te and acceptable parameters within which the ombudsperson is to perform the function
these are however only words on paper
it is ultimately the perceptions of the people within the organization that determine whether and how the office is utilized enable the ombudsperson to perform his or her duties and ascertain the degree to which the office is valued element of the organization
these per cep ti ons are formed and sustained not by words written in obscure documents but through the relationships developed between the ombudsperson and other people within the organization
the term is used broadly in this article to encompass any rapport developed through personal observation andor interpersonal communication
any time we interact with someone in our organization we establish new relationship or modify an existing one
while we strive to maintain formal inde pend en ce from our organization our interpersonal relationships with people within our organizations can significantly impact the accomplishment of our professional goals
the familiarity and trust that can be established through these relationships provides us with easier access to people and information than would be otherwise possible
this article identifies some of the people in our organizations with whom it is advisable to develop and maintain positive relationships and suggests some approaches that may be beneficial in achieving that goal
those who provide our maintenance custodial clerical and information technology services are the primary people with whom it is essential to establish and maintain positive relationships
individuals who keep essential support functions operating smoothly like those who repair heating and cooling systems elevators once visited colleague in her th floor office door locks plumbing and many others can also be included in this group depending upon the specific physical environment in which we do our work
if our relationships with these important people are not mutually respectful and positive in nature we can expect significant challenges in fulfilling our mission
such support staff are frequently ignored by the in their environment
they subsequently feel unappreciated and that they and the crucial difficult work they perform are not valued
getting to know these individuals by name smiling and greeting them when our paths cross and occasionally taking the time to verbally acknowledge them and their work is the least we can do as caring members of community
it is also essential to the maintenance of an environment necessary for the performance of our roles
positive perceptions of the ombudsperson are inculcated mostly through firsthand knowledge of the specific human being who serves as the ombudsperson
without that familiarity many who seek assistance from us are reluctant to share sensitive matters
they may have initially come to see us in part because trusted acquaintance said the ombudsperson could be trusted but they will only make important and sensitive aspects of their professional and personal life available to the ombudsperson after they have developed their own sense of the degree to which he or she can be trusted to use that information in beneficial way that is selfless helpful and caring
the issue of confidentiality is perhaps the most critical and obvious consideration of potential consult
if the ombudsperson is not trusted to maintain confidentiality many of these people will not share sensitive information that could cost them their job their grade their degree their marriage and their relationships with supervisors and coworkers
merely seeing words on piece of paper that indicate an ombudsperson will keep matters confidential pro vi des insufficient reassurance for most consul tees to take these risks
only by trusting the ombudsperson personally will they feel sufficiently at ease to share sensitive information with him or her
similarly if the ombudsperson is not perceived as able to offer neutral and independent perspective to issues constituents will assume that the options offered by the ombudsperson will instead reflect particular bias
consul tees who perceive such bias might suspect that the suggestions are somehow designed to achieve some purpose other than the outcome desired by and in the best interest of the consultee
yet another important element that helps promote positive rapport between the ombudsperson and consul tees is the perception that the ombudsperson truly cares about other people
it is frequently and correctly stated that listening is the single most important thing we do
but simply hearing what people tell us is not enough
in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and inculcate the perception that we actually care about the consultee we must engage active listening techniques that communicate empathy
carver griffin in short personal trust of the ombudsperson is ess ary precondition for many people to fully utilize the services of the office
it is not the office and ated documents that foster this confidence and trust rather it is the or potential belief that the human being who currently serves as ombudsperson can be trusted to keep sensitive matters confidential will provide advice that is unbiased and wise and cares about others
it would be great if we had the access and the time to personally speak with every new employee and student during the orientation process in order to engender this perception
unfortunately that is not feasible for most of us
how then can we engender level of trust in these individuals so that they feel adequately comfortable to contact the ombudsperson
recommendation from friend or trusted advisor can provide adequate assurance to some one that it would be and potentially helpful to contact the ombudsperson
such recommendation usually allows the potential consultee to feel adequately comfortable to engage the om buds per son in an initial evaluative conversation that allows the consultee to make his or her own determination regarding whether or not the ombudsperson can be personally trusted
the importance of these referral agents cannot be overstated
despite numerous and varied marketing techniques used by the office of the ombudsman griffin when visitors in that office complete the intake form the typical response to the question did you hear about our office
as result that office employs some marketing efforts to specifically target those within the organization who are most likely to be the first line of assistance sought out by those who might benefit from the services of the ombudsperson
those front line responders include residence hall staff members academic advisors personal counselors department chairpersons teaching assistants faculty colleagues coworkers fellow students union stew ar ds shared governance system leaders and others
department meetings training sessions and orientations provide means to introduce the om buds per son and the services of the office to such individuals
if the ombudsperson is to effectively serve as change agent by impacting the policies and procedures he or she must have adequate rap port with those who are in position to amend policies and procedures to allow for their receptiveness to the input
moreover relationships with key decision makers within the organization and with those who may influence them are important to ensure the continuation of om buds services despite economic andor political conditions that may create pressure to reduce institutional budgets
the process for developing this type of important relationship begins with the identification of the individuals who are likely to be in position to make decisions or those to whom these decision makers listen or from whom they accept advice
while this may seem like simple act of reviewing the organizational flow chart people who are familiar with human organizations and organizational behavior know that the individual who is in the formal position of author may or may not be the one who truly influences decision
that individual also may or may not be amenable to meeting with the ombudsperson
it pays to know who really has influence on organizational decisions whether they are in positions of apparent power or not
once those with influence are identified the ombudsperson can think about what types of messages might enhance the perception of the value of the office on the part of the power broker
one strategy is to present the person with information like broad trends observed in his or her area of responsibility that will allow the ombudsperson to engage in personal interaction
annual or perhaps more frequent private and formal meetings with such individuals can allow the ombudsperson to demonstrate the value of the office and also to develop relationship adequate to establish receptiveness
the identification of opportunities for less formal relationship building with decision makers and with those who influence them should also be explored
once knew an ombudsperson who went to the campus bowling alley monthly during the noon hour to bowl in an employee league with the university president
another ombudsperson made point of occasionally joining group of advisors to the chief financial officer when they took their morning coffee break in the employee cafeteria
encountering people in employee or student lounges assisting them with the building of habitat for humanity home in the community or engaging them while they take their daily constitutional on the jogging path are just few of the ways that informal contact can be made to further establish relationships
it pays to spend some time thinking of ways to meet important people in informal venues
we often refer the people who utilize our serv ic es to other offices or people within the organization for further assistance sometimes including advocacy in accomplishing their desired outcomes
we also con tact individuals in some departments who are able to clarify current departmental procedures so that we can provide the most current information and options to our consul tees
for these reasons it is important to have relationships established with these individuals and office staffs
journal of the international ombudsman association griffin such departments at institutions of higher education might typically include the admissions office offices the office the financial aid office registration and records housing parking services and others for those om buds persons serving students and offices like human resources the employ ee assistance program and the affirmative action office for those who serve employees
knowing which offices are appropriate sources of assistance for the specific circumstances and desired outcomes present ed by consultee and also knowing which persons in each of those offices are likely to be the best point of initial contact is vital for the most efficient resolution of the concerns and invaluable to the work we do
the ombudsperson who adheres to the standards of the is precluded from assuming an advocacy role
but sometimes the people who contact us for assistance are psychologically or politically unable to accomplish their desired outcomes and need the assistance of someone to advocate on their behalf regardless of the amount or type of coaching we give them
having broad knowledge of the people in the organization who are willing and able to effectively serve as advocates for particular types of people like those with disabilities racial minorities women those with non christian religious practices and even vegetarians can be an essential referral for such consul tees
it is appropriate for the ombudsperson to develop relationship with potential advocates that will adequately determine their fit ness for and willingness to perform an advocacy role for particular types of people or in particular types of situations
another important referral especially for those of us who are the sole practitioners in our organizations is that of volunteer surrogate ombudsperson
when we must recuse ourselves from serving an individual who seeks our assistance due to conflict of interest or some other factor we need to be able to refer the consultee to an alternative source of similar assistance
selecting training and securing the willingness of few other people in our organizations who can perform this function if necessary is essential to our ability to make sure that the consultee receives the services to which he or she is entitled
the ombudsperson must maintain ongoing relationships with these surrogates to ensure their continued willingness to serve remind them of the crucial aspects of the role and apprize them of any recent organizational or professional developments that might impact their role
it is very helpful to have preexisting rapport with all these types of referral associates who can then be prepared to amicably assist us or the consul tees we refer to them
brief face to face meeting or phone call to verify their appropriateness and willingness to perform such role is necessary to feel confident in referring someone to them or calling on them for assistance
subsequent occasional contact to communicate gratitude and verify continued availability is also beneficial in maintaining this type of relationship
the development of relationships with professional mentors has been of invaluable assistance to many of us in the profession
it is extremely helpful to have relationship with small group of seasoned professionals with whom one can consult in difficult times to talk through problem which is impossible to discuss with anyone in our own organization
these colleagues can offer sage advice from their ex peri enc es to supplement our own thinking
similarly firmly believe that experienced practitioners have an ethical responsibility to offer themselves as mentors to new colleagues in the field
these relationships can be cultivated through formal mentor ing programs like those offered through the or the new ombudsperson workshop offered at the annual summer meeting of college and univ er om buds persons and through informal inter ac ti ons at other professional conferences
they can also evolve by reaching out to other individuals because we think they might benefit from our help or be able to assist us based on list serv posting presentation they gave at conference an article written or referral from colleague
we should never allow ourselves to become so isolated in our professional role that we com pro mise the necessary relationships of friends family counselors and therapists and others who nourish us personally and provide us with the emotional stability we all need
colleagues who provide professional mentorship can provide empathy which contributes to our emotional and psychological health
most of us however need relationships with people outside the field as well to provide us with all the various types of personal support and assistance we need to sustain ourselves in our professional lives
in addition to family and neighbors many of us find valuable relationships in civic or religious organizations in the pursuit of our hobbies or through volunteer work
obviously while each of us has unique techniques for meeting these needs we all need to make conscious effort to develop relationships outside our professional circle that help to sustain us personally since this foundation is essential to our professional performance
one way we can develop appropriate professional relationships within the organization in which we work is through participation in informal activities
the opportunities to accomplish this vary widely from one organization to another
they may include such things as participating in community service projects staffing table at organizational expositions and attending athletic contests or other events
these activities offer an opportunity to meet people in an environment that allows for the formation of an acquaintanceship
such an acquaintanceship may be all that is necessary for that individual to recommend that someone take chance and contact the ombudsperson
he she seems like trustworthy person to me
we are bound by our professional code of ethics to organizational roles that are informal in nature there are formal activities in any organization that allow for the ombudsperson to be observed and simultaneously allow for interactions sufficient for the formation of perceptions in others
on college or university campus such events include graduation ceremonies and academic convocations where one can meet people and engage in small talk with other participants both before and after the rituals in places like the changing rooms
the same can be accomplished before and after meetings of shared governance groups like the faculty senate or other university committees
every organization will have its own unique events and rituals that may allow for the ombudsperson to interact with members of the organization outside the formal scope of the event
thinking about what activities in the organization might provide such opportunities is time well spent
another type of activity that allows for the formation of perceptions and one that many om buds persons use regularly is the group workshop or presentation
such activities can be topical presentations on organizational policies and procedures like grievance procedures or grade appeals or how to avoid them or training sessions on topics like civility or conflict resolution
the people who attend such sessions develop at the very least perception of the ombudsperson giving the presentation
they see and hear the ombudsperson interacting with those asking questions and may sometimes even talk personally with the ombudsperson after the session
this exposure and subsequent impression could result in recommendation that friend might consider utilizing the service of the ombudsperson andor an endorsement of the trustworthiness empathy and wisdom
one should also not overlook the importance and value of the in the maintenance of relationships
the author keeps supply of note cards in his desk to send to people when they win an award pass an employment milestone or successfully complete major project
the note cards are also used to express gratitude whenever appropriate
the impact of physical card in this era of electronic communications is hard to overestimate
recent recipient recounted his appreciation and excitement in receiving the card and said he had taken the card up and down the hall to share with his colleagues
know anybody still sent real he said very nice
author also takes the time to forward copies or links of articles that might be of interest to colleagues administrators or others
just the thought and simple communication can help to sustain positive rapport
journal of the international ombudsman association griffin finally the use of the internet is one of the recent technological developments that can allow for the development of at least minimal perception of the ombudsperson
for example the office web page can offer pictures of the ombudsperson and may even include brief recorded presentation to provide the op port unity to be both seen making eye contact via the screen and heard
account is another way to promulgate the services of the om buds office and offer an opportunity to develop perceptions of sort
at this time however there seems to be lack of consensus in the field as to the appropriateness of this approach
con cl us io nt he intentional development of relationships with others in our organizations including support staff potential consul tees referral agents decisions makers referral associates and professional mentors is strongly encouraged
at the same time in order to maintain perceptions of ethical appropriateness we must be wary of relationships with those in our organization that may be perceived as potentially compromising to our confidentiality neutrality or independence
striking an appropriate balance in our intra organizational relationships is something that we must constantly evaluate and adjust always keep ing in mind the potential perceptions of others
the very nature of our interactive existence in our organizations inevitably results in relationships with others
these relationships are crucial to our success
we are wise to give consideration to those persons with whom we associate and develop relationships and to also carefully consider the manner in which the relationships are established and maintained
it is only through such intentionality that we can minimize the chances that our relationships will be perceived as inappropriate while at the same time developing and nurturing those relationships that will maximize our effectiveness

ombudsman change agents me mes organizational social capital organizational change the organizational ombudsman as change agent for organizational and social capital
in io nat the conference in st louis few years ago scholar richard reuben spoke on workplace de moc racy strengths for mutual having recently published harvard negotiation law journal article linking organizational om buds and workplace democracy
after this presentation he encouraged author er be to research contribution to organizational social capital
in brief from an employer perspective organizational social capital encompasses awareness of and responsiveness to internal priorities
anything that helps employers become more attuned to their employee needs and interests arguably builds capital
harvard political scientist robert put nam along with other researchers of democratic governance developed the concept to distinguish between effective and ineffective organizational governance
at its best social capital generates organizational trust and reciprocity
as result employees students faculty and other constituencies demonstrate strong organizational citizenship or virtue
they are motivated to give generously to each other and their organization
in contrast weak social capital correlates with distrust unhealthy competition alienation and likely complaint
only minimal capital can be mandated
human capital must be inspired and nurtured rather than forced
with board support author er be proceeded in researching ways of learning and responding to organizational need
after hearing from several through survey research noteworthy pattern emerged one that stimulated the writ ing of this article
about fifty percent of the survey respondents described their role as welcoming visitors to their office and hearing their complaints essentially receptive and reactive role
the other fifty percent described what initially appeared to be journal of the international ombudsman association blo ch and er be the opposite strong proactive and systemic role with variety of means to gather information and survey organizational climate present this systemic information to leadership and otherwise work as organizational change agents
are the latter organizations necessarily more conscious of and responsive to their most important needs and interests
this article can only raise this question for future research and discussion
for now exploring the ways seasoned and respected members are able to effectively adopt and exercise the proactive change agent role is important to reaching full organizational hereinafter potential and value
one possible reason that some are keeping relatively low profile and even under the may be lack of confidence and knowledge regarding effective strategy
responses to the survey of members were relatively equally divided between those with less than three years experience and seasoned oos
this article will present the experience of the latter ranging from deliberately noting the systemic issues implicit in every complaint and continuous reflection on systemic improvement to acting as stubborn mirror of important organizational truth even when leadership is denying and resisting ac knowledgement to at request fac il it at ing the cultural transformation necessary to embrace the potential for organizational contribution
one of the copresent ers in new orleans marsha wagner reminds us that hearing concerns coaching them regarding options spontaneously embracing teachable moments facilitating dialogue and mediating conflict on request are all ways of contributing to organizational responsiveness and health
the change agent role however goes further seeing the as an independent and collaborative partner with organizational management
in earlier surveys of membership acting as early warning mechanism through upward feedback and otherwise acting as change agent was named as the most important role
perhaps the most important and distinctive role is that of organizational
as result of conf id enc es an effective may literally have more information about their organization than anyone else
optimally leadership and recognize their mutual dependence on each other
leadership needs as trusted sounding board who reminds them of organizational values
are also rich resources for consultation on policies and procedures
can easily share best practices from peer organizations
in turn need leadership to visibly support their role through listening and responding to feedback
in david words the role involves for information
because of confidentiality and independence can conduct surveys assessments and conversations that no one else can and thus ensure that all voices are heard and considered not the
simply sharing employee ideas with upper level leadership helps build social capital
also can provide oversight to promote tangible responsiveness
another of the copresent ers danielle fisc her le bai ly reminds us that gilles paquet of the university of ottawa goes so far as to describe as the who the organization
have the ability to literally see what others do not and understand the of issues rather than simply symptoms
of course strategically the does not automatically choose the toughest route
instead they seek the lowest possible level where needed change can be enacted
the other copresent er carolyn suggests beginning by asking leadership how can be most helpful to them
once change occurs can also offer essential over sight and evaluation
specific roles may include suggesting adjustment evaluating satisfaction identify ing unanticipated consequence and recommending additional change for continuous improvement
carolyn also recommended demons tr at ing the success of work through data collection
if as previously suggested the has determined that it is important to the key stake holders in the organization that the reaches all levels and corners of the organization then data collection can demonstrate that visitors to the om buds office do in fact rep re sent all structural levels departments and offices in the organization
or if leadership suggests that it is important that the have finger on the pulse of organizational morale then reporting on themes of stress around change bullying and so forth what ever themes can be gleaned from data collection provides the information that leadership has identified as important
arguably the is the best position within an organization to act as change agent
by virtue of their confidentiality and informality often receive important information that others within the organization do not including important to suggest early prevention or intervention
over time data reveals important patterns that may not be obvious to anyone else within the organization
because of their specialized training in conflict resolution work can often simply see and understand what others cannot
many are schooled in integrative negotiations and reframing
they can identify under lying needs and interests when stake holders unskilled in conflict resolution only see contentious problems or resistance to change
through strict adherence to confidentiality informality impartiality and independence the is in rare position to act fairly on behalf of all organizational interests thus optimally not threatening any concerned with particular change
once again skills can facilitate consensual and collaborative response with critical buy in from multiple stake holders
with patience and persistence who are informal internal members of the organization rather than an external consultants may be ideally suited for this important work
of course acting as an effective change agent is much said than done especially for newer who has yet to educate organizational stake holders about the role and protections and build strong trustworthy relationships with all concerned
author brian blo ch as well as his copresent ers at the conference in new orleans share over seventy years of collective experience and wisdom working in transnational corporate non profit religious federal and academic environments
change and con fl ic as opp or tun it ie for organ at io transform at io nd avid an consultant and friend introduces five roles related to organizational trans for mat ion that likely will sound familiar to members thinking systems noticing and monitoring pat terns conducting assessments coaching leader ship and advocating for processes that put people first
even apart from these roles at the presentation in new orleans author blo ch asked an intriguing question does an naturally have some effect on organizational culture whether or not by conscious design
he suggests that as mediating institution the office does indeed have natural influence on organizational culture and identity
the nature and extent of that influence however varies greatly depending on certain variables not the least of which is the mandate of the office has the been charged with that work
author blo ch went on to describe his participation in culture change as an
he had much latitude pro in his job description as his work was the only process available in the organization
he put much effort into building the credibility of the office through developing strategic relationships not only with designated leadership but with key people on all levels and on all continents
he further stressed the importance of several early high profile successes that brought the usefulness of an office to the forefront
at the same time he sees the oos work as cultural change agent to sometimes go unnoticed
he mentioned the planting of that evolve and fructify later
others may get credit or blame but those me mes can have an impact on the organization
blo ch told of recent decision his governing executive committee made to have presentation on polarity management for all its members
for years blo ch had suggested to managers this is polarity to be managed rather than problem to be
curious he asked an ec member where the idea for its proposed presentation originated
the member replied been hearing about polar to be managed rather than problem to be for the longest time
we finally decided our governing body needs to know more about this
it became clear that his mention of this concept to visitors and managers over the years had finally resulted in decision
in earlier surveys of members one respondent described the patience persistence and creative effort required for such effort particularly if an organization has historically lacked trustworthy impartial services or has climate that stresses and rewards conflict avoidance and inaction as the preferred conflict management strate gies
journal of the international ombudsman association blo ch and er be con cl us io nea ch organization is its own complex and dynamic case study for evaluating and enhancing the sharing of for mutual gain building networks of trust and promoting the best of humanity
nevertheless seasoned oos who have effectively exercised moral courage and otherwise initiated conversations around important organizational change have accumulated sophisticated discernment to offer all
the pr ac ti ca liti es needed for successful diplomacy in the toughest and trickiest of situations are likely only mastered through hard earned wisdom the job
if the most experienced of members however continue to offer their reflection and analysis of their successes growing body of practice based insight can only serve to enhance the role with organizational good will

bullying impunity harm retaliation agents of change organizational ombudsman international organizations from my study get closeup view of the birds at the feeder on the table just outside the door
on re cent morning there were as many as dozen starlings chirping and hopping away as they breakfasted on the seeds occasionally pushing one another around but not engaging in any major altercation
suddenly resplendent cardinal swooped down and landed smack in the middle of the feeding dish
how elegant he was the rich red of his plumage aptly reflecting his name
how he seemed to know how very grand he was
the first thing on his agenda was to chase away all the other birds thrusting angrily at them and click ing loudly to banish them from the food
the starlings moved away towards the edge of the table waiting for mr cardinal to eat his fill
then noticed the strangest thing occasionally he would go to the edge of the seed dish and reaching across the rim would offer some food from his beak to mrs cardinal rather drab looking bird whom he did not allow into the dish
once he was sated he flew off as dazzlingly as he had arrived mrs cardinal meekly behind and the starlings returned to what was left of their breakfast
very shortly afterwards david miller called to invite me to write something for this issue of the journal on bullying
was still thinking of the cardinal comparing him to the many powerful human bullies often clothed in robes of office or bearing titles as impressive as the plumage of the cardinal with whom have come into contact both as an ombudsman and in other professional and personal circumstances
if what appears to be bullying takes place in the animal world wondered am to conclude that bullying may be naturally occurring part of the human spectrum too
despite this depressing thought asked myself whether those who are bullied can fight effectively against it
most importantly for us as ombudsmen what can we do to help to protect people from bullies and bullying behaviour
in focusing on bullying in this issue is not alone in facing the awful reality that bullying has become part of all aspects of life october is national anti bullying month in the usa and other countries have established similar events joining in efforts to estab lish new laws and provide help lines for those affected by bullying
there is growing moral stocktaking of bullying worldwide at local and national levels in social and faith based communities in educational arenas and in the workplace which is reflected in the increasing focus of the international media on this issue
saddest and most compelling of all young people across the world who have been subjected to the destabilizing effects of cy ber bullying are losing their lives
this is as serious as it gets
society has be gun to take action and ombudsmen do indeed have role to play
we all have some idea of what bully is what surprise to learn that etymologically in english the word started out meaning quite the opposite of what it signifies today
from term of endearment for both sexes in the sixteenth century it has come to designate in the definition tyrannical coward who makes himself terror to the
some of the organizations of the united nations system established the om buds function over forty years ago to address work related problems in an informal manner
as in other work places all over the world bullying in the united nations has been near the top of the list of issues to be addressed
journal of the international ombudsman association minimize its occurrence and to deal with it effectively when it does arise
establishing those measures was not an easy task and the lessons learned can be of great value in dealing with bullying
even calling bullying by its proper name not concealing it under the guise of managerial or is an important step forward as is not try ing to explain it away on supposed cultural grounds or gender proclivity
one of the disturbing facets of increasing decentralization in international and multinational organizations is the impunity that can accompany authority managers become tyrants cowing staff into obedience until someone has the courage to speak up
well into my third decade as an ombudsman in the united nations system have no hesitation in saying that dealing with bullies men and women at all levels at headquarters and at duty stations has been one of the biggest challenges have faced
the united nations has made some significant attempts to improve managerial standards but the problems are huge in hierarchical decentralized structure
as ombudsmen we are used to helping people in disadvantaged positions to explore their options
what options are there for those tortured by bullies
is it reasonable or even possible to try to reach an in for mal resolution in situation where people may have suffered great emotional and psychological harm from bully
in my experience the visitor who has been bullied is often very scared to talk even to an ombudsman
keeping in mind the terror but also the courage that bring bullied visitors to the office the first step is to help them to understand the bullying mentality
handouts prepared by the office can be supple ment ed by the wealth of information and advice available online
while an ombudsman can certainly explain the psyche corroboration from other authoritative sources can reinforce the message that the visitor should receive
if the visitor can grasp why someone bullies it can be much easier to examine practical options
it is sometimes possible to empower the visitor to take steps to confront the bully to tell the bully ex act ly either verbally or in written form what personal damage the bullying is causing and ask the bully to stop
in my experience this can be effective and the bullying does sometimes stop
unfortunately how ever there is often too much at stake for the visitor to take the plunge especially in international organizations where work permits visa status and family welfare may be placed at risk
an ombudsman at the request of the visitor may speak with the alleged bully but the situation could deter io rate even further if the bully does in fact retaliate
is it good idea to explore with the visitor the option of lodging formal charge
suppose that the alleged bully is in turn being bullied to meet unreasonable deadlines with insufficient staff say and interpret his or her behaviour as bullying but as the organizational norm
only the affected staff may realize that in efforts to mobilize phenomenal resources manager may destroy the office spirit by bullying staff to reach the goals
furthermore in some instances the organization overlooks even rewards bully ing behaviour because the bully has excelled in meet ing important organizational goals
often it does not regard disciplinary action as an option and may prefer to move the bullying manager to another office perhaps with warning sometimes with promotion so that it can continue to benefit from the expertise
this enables even encourages the bully to continue bullying and sends very discouraging message to the staff
what if manager is trying to reorganize an office according to new organizational requirements and some people on the team do not like the change and regard it as bullying
what if the om buds discovers that the charge of bullying is false
what about those times when in shift of power facilitated these days by electronic communications it is the manager who is bullied by supervise es
to be effective in all these circumstances it is vital for the ombudsman to know as much as possible about the organizational environment
precipitate action can have disastrous consequences
in the same way that ombudsmen worked with organizations to change the culture that condoned sexual harassment we must now use our strengths as trusted agents of change to bring about fundamental transformation that will enable organizations to decrease cases of bullying in the workplace and to act swiftly and decisively to hold bullies responsible for their actions
we can make recommendations in our reports and convene and inspire stake holders to establish mandatory training in how to recognize bullying how to prevent it and how to report it
in other words the catalytic role of the ombudsman is to raise aware ness of the scourge of bullying and help to empower organizations to root it out
labeling people multiparty collaboration organizational om buds organizational dynamics situations described as are likely to be highly charged emotionally feelings of fear in se and vulnerability may be experienced by the alleged target the alleged bully the bystanders and the supervisors of the alleged target andor the alleged bully
the label may be interpreted in various ways and the use of such general pejorative term like the use of other stereotypes may objectify complex human being freeze in time potentially dynamic situation or limit the options for reframing dialogue and empathy
use of judgmental terms such as and may create perceptions expectations and biases that undermine om buds neutrality and limit insight into resolution options
emotionally intense conflicts can be fluid
the alleged may feel misunderstood and exhibit charac ter is tics of
conversely the alleged may feel angry and display aggressive or blaming behavior associated with
description of actual behavior is more accurate and reliable than use of oversimplified role labels like and or
attitudes and actions in the role of and are learned behaviors perhaps reinforced by lifetime of short term gains
but these repertoires are very limited which provides the om buds with abundant opportunities for coaching in reframing alter nate communication skills and expanded approaches to conflict resolution
the attitudes and behaviors that are often identified as an abuse of power that can be called range across very broad spectrum
it is helpful to describe offensive or hurtful behavior specifically rather than using loaded but vague cover term like
it is essential to understand the facts of each unique situation to create appropriate remedies interventions that may be effective in addressing angry outbursts may not be so effective in addressing behaviors such as spreading negative information about another or deliberately excluding someone from group activities
the om buds perspective takes into consideration all the interests of all the stake holders and not just the interplay or power dynamics between primary par ties
the organizational context including people policies structures and organizational culture may be contributing factors
the om buds should probe to identify the contributions of all parties and organizational dynamics to situation described as and thus seek opportunities for change from various perspectives
multiple stake holders are likely to be aware of the situation even if responses have been conflict averse
isolation of the primary parties for example in complainant re sp on dent disciplinary procedure may further polarize or escalate the conflict
multiparty approach may not only reduce intensity by depersonalizing the situ
journal of the international ombudsman association ati on but may also provide wider variety of options for support adjustments remedies enforcement and change in root causes
the om buds may explore alternative sources of power for the primary parties as well as for bystanders and supervisors
by focusing on each interests and goals it may be possible to identify alternative interactive modes and broader systemic structures for conflict resolution
the om buds should seek durable resolutions in vo lv ing collaborative commitment from all participants rather than merely the imposition of short term or only punitive consequences
collaborative ap proach es are enhanced by clear identification and understanding of the particular factors involved in the conflict inclusion of multiple parties focus on shared organizational values and goals and neutral approach to embrace affirm and satisfy as many individual and organizational interests as possible
wagner journal of the international ombudsman association abstract this article summarizes significant developments in us legislation and litigation relating to organizational om buds from february through august
since the last legal update major financial reform legislation created three new federal om buds programs
in most significant case the fifth circuit court of ap peals found that university investigatory report raised significant issues of fact in free speech case
handful of decisions from trial courts indicate that lawyers and judges continue to struggle with the legal standards applicable to om buds
as general rule trial court decision cannot by cited as legal precedent
only appellate decisions including state and federal supreme courts establish legal authority
however trial court decisions can help create exp ec tat ions within the legal community especially in areas where there is scant case law
dis im er the information and opinions provided in this article are solely those of the author
they have not been adopted or endorsed by the international ombudsman assoc ia ti on or the university of california
nothing contained herein is intended to address any specific legal inquiry nor is it substitute for independent legal research to original sources or for obtaining the advice of legal counsel with respect to legal problems
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act signed into law on july will establish om buds programs for the securities and exchange commission concerns and two programs within the new consumer financial pro tec ti on bureau
the new sec om buds will be named by the head of the office of the investor advocate who is ap pointed by the sec chair
the investor advocate will be responsible for assisting individual investors with issues involving the sec or other self regulatory organization such as the new york stock exchange
the new om buds would serve as confidential liaison for the same population
the bill does not provide any guidelines for implementing the om buds program so details need to be worked out
the bill does state however that the new om buds office will not replace or diminish any existing agency om buds
the reform bill also establishes two om buds pro grams in the consumer financial protection bureau
the first serves as the agency om buds for the bureau essentially confidential liaison for individuals with problems relating to the activities of the bureau resulting from the regulatory activities of the bureau
the details of this new om buds program are unde fined
in addition there will be separate om buds program to mediate disputes between student borrowers and private lenders
here again there are few details but it is expected that the new om buds will resemble the existing om buds at the department of education which serves students with federal student loan issues
journal of the international ombudsman association it is clear that these new om buds programs need to be further defined by the respective agencies
so far there is no indication that any individual om buds or any om buds association is participating in the process
on the positive side the coalition of federal ombudsmen has been an important resource for new om buds programs in the federal sector in the past
over the past year and half several other pieces of legislation sought unsuccessfully to cre ate om buds offices for other government agencies transportation security administration for issues relating to the federal air marshal department of the treasury for stake holders of community financial institutions office of the director of national in tel lig en ce for issues arising out of applications for intelligence community security clearances
these efforts indicate that legislators will continue to consider om buds programs of some kind for federal agencies
the failure of these bills should not be taken as legislative rejection of organizational om buds these bills merely met the same fate as the vast major of proposed laws
indeed the om buds programs created by the dodd frank act had been proposed many times in prior congressional sessions
li tig at io nr ep ort by om buds becomes critical evidence in lawsuit against university in the case of de pree saunders the univ er of southern mississippi was largely in defeating the claims of tenured professor cha unc ey de pree
the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit upheld the ruling of the trial court which had dismissed nearly all of allegations that wrongly stripped him of his teaching duties and evicted him from his office because he had criticized the university
on the issue of whether the university had violated the free speech rights how ever the appellate court returned the case to the trial court for further hearing
the appellate court found that the case presented complex first amendment issues particularly in light of report prepared by om buds
according to the summary the case arose when faculty from the business business school complained about allegedly negative and disruptive behavior and failure to engage in scholarly or professional activities
the university president re de pree of his teaching obligations and barred him from the campus
de pree however retained his title tenure and salary despite actions
president then requested the provost to have the om buds investigate the charges against de pree
the om buds produced report containing what the court characterized as dispassionate conclusions and recommendations
it was this report that gave the court reason for the appellate court to remand the case for further development
the court said late intervention of the ombudsman report and the response to it have created factual moving target
for these reasons the court remanded the case allowing de pree to pursue an injunction against on his first amendment retaliation claim
organizational om buds especially those in higher education will be quick to point out that they do not conduct investigations on demand nor do they issue written recommendations regarding the resolution of specific cases
these actions are clearly contra indic at ed by standards of practice
moreover the om buds was not an member and did not follow the organizational om buds model
unfortunately for om buds practicing in mississippi louisiana and texas the fifth circuit did not consider these standards in its decision and the decision creates citable precedent
should om buds issues come before federal courts in this jurisdiction in the future judges may look to the de pree case as the best description of om buds practices
organizational om buds would then have more difficult task of asserting privilege or arguing that standards should apply
kos ako ws ki journal of the international ombudsman association ee oc requires two employers to adopt om buds programs to settle class action discrimination suits in two separate cases the equal employment opportunity commission required employers ac cu sed of gender discrimination to establish om buds programs as part of court approved settlement
in november the cheesecake factory inc
nationwide restaurant chain settled charges that six male employees were subjected to repeated sexual harassment at an arizona restaurant
in addition to monetary settlement and other measures the cheesecake factory agreed to designate an om buds to and forward complaints of discrimination from employees
the standards for the new om buds position were otherwise undefined
in similar case the ee oc settled major gender discrimination lawsuit against ohio express trucking firm with employees headquartered in pit ts burgh pennsylvania
under the terms of the settlement the company was to pay compensatory damages and provide other remedial relief to resolve claims of unlawful discrimination against women
among other steps ohio agreed to designate an in house om buds to informally resolve workplace issues that may arise from women filling driver and dockworker jobs
here again the court failed to incorporate any standards for the om buds position
additional details for the new om buds program would have given the parties more guidance in creating and evaluating the ohio om buds office
these two cases indicate that the ee oc views om buds programs as effective tools in addressing dysfunctional work places
as settlement orders of trial courts however these cases do not establish any legal precedent
update jury returns verdict in rape case in vo lv ing university of washington om buds the case of ss alexander was detailed ex tensive ly in prior issue of the journal of
in that case the washington state appellate court imputed knowledge of gender discrimination to the university of washington after female student disclosed her claims of rape and harassment by another student to the campus om buds who tried to resolve the case through mediation
the court further found that the om buds was an under title ix ie an official authority to take corrective action to end the
this meant that the university om buds was an agent for notice for gender discrimination issues
following the appellate decision the case was returned to the trial court in seattle
in november the jury hearing the case returned verdict for the defendants
according to the seattle times the jury found not liable on the narrow reasoning that the educational opportunities had not been sufficiently harmed because she remained in school kept high grade point average and graduated
nonetheless jurors sought to amend their verdict to include statement scolding for its handling of the matter
although she did not prevail the plaintiff expressed satisfaction with the lawsuit
the state appellate court decision therefore will remain published decision with implications for organizational om buds in washington state
most significantly it has become much difficult for an om buds to argue for privilege in washington court
federal court orders production of om buds records from ib ma federal trial court in oklahoma hearing two related cases accounting principals inc
ordered ibm to produce files from its om buds office
the cases arose out of contract between ibm and two firms for accounting staff accounting principals inc and pinstripe
when ibm sought to end the contracts and pinstripe were referred to global procurement ombudsman an objective and impartial office that assists in resolving procurement related concerns and issues
at the direction of general counsel the om buds conducted an investigation and submitted report
ibm initially restored the contacts with and pinstripe but later transferred the work to another vendor manpower inc after filing suit and pinstripe sought to compel production of report by om buds
ibm ob on the grounds of attorney client and at torney work product privileges
in evaluating these arguments the court characterized the role of the ibm om buds using the standards enunciated by the american bar association kos ako ws ki journal of the international ombudsman association generally an ombudsman works outside of normal line management structures and directly to upper management
an ombudsman is not an advocate for the complainant nor is his role to defend the corporation he works for
his role is that of an impartial neutral seeking the best resolution of the dispute
the court therefore concluded that the primary purpose for which the documents were created was not anticipation of litigation but separate business purpose fostering more open effective and pro duct ive relationship with suppliers
in addition the court observed that none of the om buds documents appeared to contain communications seeking legal advice
ibm did not raise any other legal arguments that would have protected the work
the court therefore ordered ibm to produce most of the materials produced by its om buds
this was therefore result for om buds
the court did not consider the om buds to be tool of counsel and favorably referenced the aba standards which are largely in line with standards
but the court did not find any bases to protect the work product and communications
for better or worse this trial court decision does not create any precedent
complaint to fb om buds does not satisfy exhaustion requirement in rider goldy federal trial court in calif or ruled that prisoner cannot satisfy requirement to exhaust administrative remedies by sending letter to the federal bureau of investigation ombudsman
the plaintiff in the case christopher rider complained that california prison officials violated his civil rights while in custody
in order to satisfy the legal requirement that he had previously sought and exhausted all forms of informal or formal relief from the proper administrative officials rider alleged that he had written to the fbi ombudsman asking for an investigation of the alleged conduct
the court summarily rejected the argument
the decision on this issue is reassuringly predictable because the fbi ombudsman deals only with work related concerns of fbi employees and has no connection to prisoners especially those in state custody
however as the decision of trial court this case creates no legal precedent endnotes

sincere thanks to employees managers union leaders and administration and to their very de di cat ed ombudsman
introduction the ombudsman has long been recognized as powerful institution that is at its best capable of addressing host of critical organizational challenges and employee needs ko lb
formally str uc tur ed to resolve workplace conflicts and tensions the om buds function has been shown to have broader range of potential benefits for different stake holders ro we
thus for example in addition to man ag ing and resolving conflict the ombudsman can act as conduit through which important organizational in formation is transferred and metabolized ko lb ro we
the ombudsman has also been shown to enhance organizational learning and effectiveness wagner
one of the areas that has received less attention in this context is the ability of the org ani zati on al ombudsman to facilitate workplace fairness
more specifically there is limited research on the re lation ship between the organizational role and employee perceptions of fairness
given that perceptions of fairness are central to the very legitimacy and sustain ability of the om buds key organizational roles this absence of research is somewhat puzzling
the ability of the ombudsman to perform her tasks is to large extent contingent on the belief that procedures interactions and decisions are all conducted in manner that up holds basic notions of fairness
furthermore fairness perceptions are important for individual and org ani zati on al level outcomes
thus better understanding of the effects of ombudsman related activities and perceptions of fairness would benefit scholarship and practice in this domain
in fact section of the international ombudsman association standards of practice states ombudsman strives for impartial fairness and objectivity in the treatment of people the ability to influence perceptions of organizational fairness toward multi stakeholder framework ariel avg ar journal of the international ombudsman association ariel avg ar and the consideration of if fairness is central to the work of the ombudsman why we know more about this organizational dimension
how does the ombudsman influence perceptions of org ani za ti on al fairness
it is likely that difficulty in assessing the relationship between the ombudsman and organizational fair ness rests among other reasons on the tremendously varied roles responsibilities and outcomes associated with this increasingly important workplace institution
an effective organizational ombudsman is engaged in wide range of activities that entail different modes of communication and interaction
as such the ways in which the ombudsman is likely to affect per cep ti ons of fairness are dynamic and shift as function of the specific role being played and the outcomes for organizational members
furthermore one of the complexities associated with the ombudsman role is the need to address and balance different stake holder needs and interests
here too this variation in ombudsman affected stake holders is also likely to create more dynamic relationship between the ombudsman and fairness perceptions
finally fairness itself is multidimensional construct
among the core dimensions identified by organizational justice and fairness scholars are procedural distributive and interactional green berg
in other words in addition to the need to assess fairness as function of different ombudsman roles and responsibilities the relationship between the ombudsman and per cep ti ons of fairness needs to also account for these differ faces
to be clear this linkage between the ombudsman and organizational fairness departs from the traditional focus on the role an individual disputant employee or manager
the proposition set forth in this article is that in addition to the imp or tan ce of focusing on the imperative that the org ani zati on al om buds engage members in manner that is fair scholarship needs to assess the extent to which this institution affects broader climate of fairness in organizations
in fact recent fairness scholarship sup ports the notion that organizational per ce pt ions of fairness can be directed toward multiple entities such as an individual the unit or the or ga ni zati on lav elle and br oc kn er
in other words the activities and interactions are likely to influence perceptions of fairness that go beyond the specific individual relationship at hand
this paper develops multi stakeholder framework for understanding the role
more cif ic ally this article documents findings from case study of an ombudsman office in large us teach ing hospital referred to here as american medical to propose that an effective ombudsman affects differ gains for different organizational stake holders
furthermore this stakeholder framework provides lens through which to better understand how the ombudsman can enhance perceptions of procedural distributive and interactional fairness
taken together it is argued that enhancing perceptions of fairness requires different focus across the range of om buds man activities and responsibilities
in what follows three central organizational fairness dimensions will be reviewed
next the article provides an overview of the american medical case study
finally evidence for multi stakeholder ombudsman framework is provided highlighting implications for organizational fairness
three dimensions of organizational fairness over the past five decades organizational scholars have amassed large body of research on the antecedents and consequences of perceptions of fairness for recent reviews see ro ch and shan cock
employee perceptions of justice or the fairness of the treatment they receive from an organization and its members have been shown to influence both individual and organizational level outcomes see for example sim ons and rober son
for example employee perceptions of org ani zati on al fairness have been linked to employee health and wellbeing turnover intentions and organizational citizenship behavior et al
although scholars conceptualize fairness differently there has been for the most part consensus regarding some of its key dimensions
first justice scholars have made distinction between procedural and distributive fairness
distributive fairness which received great deal of attention by early justice scholars refers to the fairness of the ends achieved or the content of journal of the international ombudsman association ariel avg ar an organizational decision or action et al
procedural fairness on the other hand refers to the fairness of the means used to reach specific distributive end de cre mer et al
thus in assessing fairness of given decision or action individuals are likely to be examining both distributive content and procedural process elements
in addition to the distinction between process and content more recent justice scholarship has intro duc ed third fairness dimension that focuses on the interpersonal treatment and interactions referred to as interactional fairness anderson and patter son luo
interactional fairness has been shown to be affected by interpersonal justice or the extent to which individuals feel that they are treated in manner that is respectful and dignified during decision process
in addition interactional fairness is influenced by informational justice which captures the extent to which individuals are provided with in formation regarding decisions made processes used and actual distributive outcomes et al
recent research has supported the relationship be tween organizational characteristics such as structure and design and employee fairness perceptions
for example the level of centrality and size of an org ani zati on have been shown to influence employee per ce pt ions of distributive procedural and interactional fairness crop an za no and
how can the organizational ombudsman affect these different fairness dimensions
this paper examines the potential linkages between the work of the or ga ni zati on al ombudsman and each of these di men si ons of fairness
the argument set forth below is that by addressing different stakeholder needs the om buds function also affects workforce perceptions of fairness
responding to different needs of front line middle and top management stake holders leads to the facilitation of distributive procedural and inter ac ti on al perceptions of fairness
case study background in an effort to examine antecedents to and outcomes associated with the adoption of conflict management system as part of broader research project case study research was conducted at can medical large us teaching hospital
american medical was unique setting in which to examine the issues discussed above due among other things to the conception design and implementation of an organizational ombudsman as part of dispute resolution system piloted by the federal mediation and conciliation services fm cs in
in the sum mer of american medical was contacted by the fm cs concerning the possibility of serving as site for pilot dispute resolution program
the pilot dispute resolution systems initiated by the fm cs in included number of common tur es
first they were implemented parallel to at least one collective bargaining agreement that covered portion of the workforce
second the systems included the implementation of number of conflict management options which in this case included union and nonunion processes for address ing employee grievances alongside wide range of ombudsman responsibilities robinson pearl stein and mayer
this characteristic is in line with the general literature on conflict management systems see lip sky see ber and finch er
third all pilot programs included an interest based resolution op ti on that focuses on the needs and interests of the disputing parties as opposed to contractual or sta tu tory rights robinson et al
fourth the fm cs decided that one of the necessary characteristics of dispute resolution system in the unionized setting is the presence of an internal ombudsman as opposed to the using of roster of external neutrals
following introductory meetings with labor and management stake holders american medical and the fm cs set up design team in january
key and relevant stake holders were identified during meetings with the unions top management and the human resources department
the team included five representatives from management five re pres en ta from each union and five representatives from the nonunion hospital workforce
there was also wide array of additional hospital stake holders beyond those formally selected
this composition played journal of the international ombudsman association ariel avg ar key role in the design process and implementation field notes december
two fm cs mediators facilitated the monthly meetings
at the conclusion of yearlong design process dur ing which the team grappled with issues of structure division of authority and procedures an ombudsman office and joint operating committee were established
in february the dispute resolution program referred to here as resolve got underway at american medical field notes june archival hospital information on the program and its ti on
reflecting the general excitement with which the unique initiative was pursued the vice president of human resources sent the following announcement as most of you know we have had committee com prised of equal representation from management nonunion nonmanagement unionized employees at work for over year on the development of an alternative dispute resolution program
we are the first of some employers across the country targeted by the fm cs look at and try to find better ways to deal with conflict
what makes this approach unique is that it has been developed exclusively through collaboration and consensus
the committee members are coming before you as group with great enthusiasm to roll out the program
methodology following correspondence with the hospital ombudsman in june was granted research access to the hospital and specifically to activities and material dealing with conflict and conflict manage ment
participated in monthly meetings in which important discussions took place regarding the program and in management and professional meet in gs all of which provided important contextual in for mat ion about the hospital culture pressing issues and considerations and the strategic mind set
qualitative and quantitative data were collected at american medical over period of approximately fifteen months between july and november
the qualitative methodology included some interviews with employees and managers throughout the hospital including the chief executive officer the chief operating officer an array of middle managers and front line employees from different hospital de part men ts
in addition to formal semi structured in ter views with sample of employees across different occupational groups and hospital units data was also collected through group discussion with front line staff from different hospital units observations of top management meetings observations of ombudsman office meetings trainings and dispute resolution si ons observations of the joint operating committee and the use of archival material including the hospital newsletter and transcripts from hospital meetings
many of the observations focused on the work throughout the organization and relevant meetings and discussions
with regard to quantitative data was granted ac cess to archival information on complaints that were filed through the system
in addition specially designed survey was used to measuring employee attitudes and perception toward the conflict re so lu ti on system
of the surveys administered surveys were completed and were useable response rate of close to
comparison of the survey results with documented dispute resolution activity provided an opportunity for an analysis of the extent to which various conflicts are dealt with through different conflict resolution outlets
in sum access granted by american medical to both qua li tat ive and quantitative data provided unique pos si bi li ties for studying dispute resolution program in an industry that was relatively understudied in this regard
what have done for me lately
stakeholder perspective on ombudsman outcomes and their potential effect on an organizational fairness climate much of the literature on dispute resolution and conflict management systems including the adoption of an organizational ombudsman has been limited in its discussion of associated outcomes
dispute re so lu ti on practices have been assessed in terms of their effect on organizational turnover or exit of employees see for example batt col vin and kee fe for recent review see col vin kl aas and mah ony
journal of the international ombudsman association ariel avg ar other studies have examined the effects of nonunion dispute resolution procedures on the career pro gres sion of the employee who filed the complaint and the employee against whom the complaint was filed lew in
finally researchers have examined outcomes from litigation perspective such as win rates and cost comparisons for review see col vin et al
short of these general outcome categories there is gap in the research on organizational and individual level outcomes of alternative dispute resolution strategies
in an effort to highlight the broad array of outcomes associated with an om buds headed conflict man age ment system three stakeholder groups were examined front line employees middle managers and top management
as demonstrated below the organizational ombudsman and the associated tem had vastly different effects on each of the groups
although the formal function of dispute resolution system is to resolve microlevel conflicts between individuals this case study highlights that in fact the system provides mechanism through which broader organizational outcomes such as communication and coordination are achieved
as will be discussed by addressing these three types of stakeholder level outcomes the ombudsman is able to among other things enhance organizational perceptions of fairness
front line employees outcomes individual level conflict resolution research at american medical included ob ser vat ions of number of sessions conducted by the ombudsman with front line employees
for the most part these sessions addressed conflicts arising in given unit among employees or with supervisor
the ombudsman was called in to develop strategies for dealing with conflict and its underlying causes
in such instances the presence of dispute resolution system provided an alternative outlet for the unit su per visor through which persistent problems that were usually interpersonal could be addressed
what the sessions highlighted in particular was the potency of such individual level conflicts and the mat ic effects on the way in which front line employees carried out their responsibilities
employees described the effects of conflicts with peers and supervisors in their unit as unbearable and paralyzing in terms of their ability to conduct routine work
one front line nurse described the effects of ongoing conflict with unit employee as follows there are mornings when the thought of coming into work and dealing with all of this makes me sick
sometimes need to stop on the side of the road get so sick
will call in and say am going to be late had to stop on the side of the road again
it just gets to me that way
know why dispute resolution session april
this visceral effect of conflict described by this licensed practical nurse was not unusual
em spoke about spending large portions of their time dealing with conflicts that arose on their floors and the physical and emotional consequences field notes april
at this level the dispute resolution system provided mechanism for resolving persis tent conflicts and more importantly provided tools and skills for dealing with such situations
in short the program represented an institutionalized vehicle through which to confront deep rooted interpersonal and professional conflicts
clearly by addressing individual level front line con flic ts and disputes the organizational ombudsman is potentially affecting multiple dimensions of fairness including procedural and interactional ones
never the less the resolution of these conflicts goes to the heart of the distributive face of fairness
as noted in the review above distributive fairness is concerned with the content of decisions or actions
the involve ment of the organizational ombudsman with work place disputes that would otherwise probably go unaddressed allowed for american dispute resolution system to serve as vehicle through which to deliver substantive remedies to its front line em
thus it is proposed that the organizational ombudsman has the capacity to enhance an or ga distributive fairness climate by addressing substantive individual level conflict and tensions on the shop floor
journal of the international ombudsman association ariel avg ar middle management outcomes coordination in the midst of restructuring existing literature on hospital restructuring has presented empirical evidence on the consequences associated with this process in terms of conflict and its resolution
interviews conducted with middle man ag ers at american medical provide additional support for the claim that structural changes experienced by most us hospitals have had dramatic organizational consequences particularly for middle management
thus for example the manager of the pr ac tice sites and physician practices stated we are going through major overhaul and we need buy in
want to redesign the way we work and imp le ment system changes but there is tremendous res is tan ce restructuring creates mistrust which makes our job in changing things around here very difficult interview hospital practice site and physician pr ac tice manager june
in response to employee resistance to the re struct ur ing process this manager turned to the resolve program for assistance and support
the ombudsman was brought in to assist in what became multiparty restructuring negotiations arena
as the man ag ers found themselves negotiating with the physicians nurses and allied professional staff over the contours and implications of the unit restructuring the pres en ce of an in house neutral proved highly beneficial field notes june
one of the interesting aspects associated with the restructuring of this particular unit was the strong resistance on the part of physicians to the anticipated changes
although physicians were not active users of the system in the case of the restructuring of the unit and negotiated change with this strong hospital stakeholder the dispute resolution program extended into their domain
the physician director of this ra diol unit referred to the dynamics as follows some people around here have lot of power in resist ing change
if the doctors are not supportive of us employees will not listen to us
we need the help to negotiate status power and control interview physician unit director june
the administrator of this same unit stated you are never going to get consensus out of doctors
we need to develop consensus over restructuring and need assistance in this negotiation interview hospital practice site and physician practice manager june
what emerged from this specific example and from interviews with other managers throughout the hospital is the role the dispute resolution system and the ombudsman played as coordinating and consensus building mechanism in the service of man agers confronted with the challenges of restructuring
thus although the resolution of conflict is integral to this system role it is not the only component
the ombudsman helped managers build alliances and develop trust in the changes necessitated by intense restructuring pressures field notes june
often what appears to be interpersonal workplace conflict is actually problem of coordination that stems from uncertainty regarding organizational structures and roles
in this sense the dispute re so lu ti on program not only treated workplace conflicts but also assisted managers in handling structural issues that might otherwise have led to conflicts
as the ombudsman reported one group of employees had been laboring for years under faulty understanding of their organizational structure
discussions clarified for example who reports to whom
this new information helped them understand behavior about which they had been resentful and angry
they continue to refine their or ga ni zati on al understanding and are moving forward to create an excellent team that provides excellent patient care ombudsman report on office cases december
with increased institutionalization of the resolve program the role of restructuring coordination became more prominent
the ombudsman was asked to attend number of unit retreats intended to ease the restructuring process and to discuss the ways in which unit members dealt with the fears frustrations journal of the international ombudsman association ariel avg ar and conflicts associated with this process
in addition growing number of middle managers began turning to the program for assistance in dealing with col leagues and supervisors around restructuring issues
this coordinating role became especially vital in early when rumors of possible merger with large and well established hospital became prevalent
despite attempts on the part of top management to dispel these rumors employees and middle managers began using the resolve program as mechanism to voice and process merger implications
significantly those making use of the program in this regard were overwhelmingly middle managers
in the summer of the hospital announced that although there were no concrete plans to merge the two hospitals were engaged in discussions of ways to cooperate
this announcement triggered an even greater usage of the resolve program by hospital managers
the increase was so dramatic that the om buds man began devoting much of her time to these stakeholder issues interview with hospital om buds man june
participation of managers in the program jumped from of all users in to of all users in
if the resolution of shop floor individual conflicts and disputes is likely to play key role in enhancing perceptions of an distributive fairness the coordination related outcomes go to the core of the procedural dimension of fairness
as reviewed above procedural fairness refers to the extent to which organizational members believe that decisions and actions taken were arrived at through an inclusive and transparent process
by getting deeply involved and engaged in structural unit level changes the organizational ombudsman provides the process related elements that are likely to increase perceptions of procedural fairness
this is especially crucial in organizational environments like healthcare where large scale changes and decisions are common and fast paced
thus it is proposed that the organizational ombudsman has the capacity to enhance an procedural fairness climate by addressing managerial coordination issues at the unit level
top management outcomes strategic communications and organizational culture over the course of the adoption and usage processes of the resolve program the hospital lead er ship became increasingly aware that being vested in the dispute resolution program had the potential to convey top management communications down to middle managers and front line employees and to receive communications from these groups through the ombudsman
of special note in this respect was the chief operating officer coo who seemed to intuitively sense that the program could be used in this capacity
on number of occasions the coo relied on the resolve program to disseminate information about leadership directions and vision
this was an imp or ta nt function given the emphasis that hospital lead er ship and the coo in particular placed on org ani za ti on al communication
for example when asked in hospital hall what could be done to improve the organization the coo stated need to continue to improve communications and inter ac ti on between leadership and direct care providers and support hospital town hall meeting november
regarding the role in promoting organizational communication he remarked one of the things that the program does is keep me apprised of the culture the things that are setting people off the issues that we need to fix
having someone who is close to the action and who can help me take the bigger picture approach is very good
it is not that trust other individuals but they have vested interests interview december
in addition to articulating leadership messages through the dispute resolution program top manage ment and especially the coo and vice president of human resources used the program to learn about other stakeholder problems and concerns in more direct manner
one of the areas where this was clearly exhibited related to fears and frustrations about pit al restructuring
as mentioned above the program came to play an important role in both support and coordination as well as conflict resolution related to restructuring
when such issues arose they were tine ly communicated to the hospital leadership
journal of the international ombudsman association ariel avg ar apprehensions regarding possible hospital merger are good case in point
although the and coo may have been aware of the unrest this was caus ing at all levels the actual evidence provided by the dispute resolution program sensitized them to the extent of the problem
by briefing the hospital coo on emerging issues related to restructuring in various hospital units the ombudsman was able to connect top management to the perspectives and per cep ti ons of managers and employees that may not have been clearly understood or articulated
over time the office came to recognize its role as facilitator of organizational communication
the ombudsman framed the role in the follow ing manner having confidential independent program like resolve allows employees an avenue for having the kinds of discussions that keep them engaged in change processes
especially in the hierarchical and fast paced environment of health care clear com munic ati on can be compromised even by the best communicators with the best intentions
at american medical maintaining excellent and easy channels for communication is an important goal not only for em ploy ee satisfaction but also for patient safety phone interview hospital ombudsman june
second and related outcome associated with the resolve program for top management was the reinforcement of the espoused organizational culture one that emphasizes and creates embedded trust
it was hard to miss the organizational culture sought af ter by its leadership large banners and signs boasted the trustworthiness of the hospital and its staff
one of the advertised slogans prevalent throughout the hospital stated underestimate the power of trust
another banner stated will never take your trust for granted
finally an advertisement for hospital awards stated are nice trust is bet ter
the strong emphasis on trust as an organizational value was evident throughout my interviews with the hospital and coo
both articulated the need in the highly competitive industry to create an environ ment that fosters trust with patients interviews with hospital and coo december
although the emphasis on trust pertained in many ways to the relationship between the hospital and its client base the culture of trust set forth by man age ment is not solely hospital patient attribute
in interviews would regularly inquire about the mean ing of the trust focused slogans
many including top managers interpreted these to include trust between the hospital and its employees and more specifically between management and front line employees
one employee stated expect to have trust with the patients if you have trust with the employ interview with june
while culture based on trust between different stake holders was goal for top management it was not evenly diffused across the hospital
some man ag ers and front line employees treated aspirations for trusting relationships and the slogans that marketed these in rather cynical manner
not everyone felt that awards took second place to trust
furthermore many of the pressures placed on hospitals today and the associated responses have been empirically linked to outcomes that are in tension with organizational trust such as stress decreased satisfaction and in creased conflict see for example we in berg
in this sense the resolve program played an un an role in strengthening both the actual level of organizational trust and perceptions of the hospital as genuinely committed to this core value
the resolve program assisted in trust building in four central ways
first by resolving actual conflicts and disputes the program assisted in mending relationships and increasing interpersonal trust
second it played cen tr al role in facilitating unit and hospital restructuring in manner that provided employees and managers with more information and tools to confront fears concerns and frustrations
in doing so the program enhanced unit level trust
by influencing these two outcomes for front line employees and managers the program was also achieving third ing support for the organizational culture
the president of the local union articulated this linkage by stating made and actions taken by the conflict management system have to enhance the trust we have in each meet ing march
in hospital report to the community the local president is quoted as stating resolve program is helping improve com mu ni cations with each other and to further strengthen journal of the international ombudsman association ariel avg ar our work environment by building culture of mutual respect and trust
coming from the union president this was strong endorsement of the role in advancing managerial centered objective and illustrates the broader role played by the dispute re so lut ion system
the very showcasing of the resolve program in the annual report as way in which the hospital has been striving to achieve the desired cul tu re further underscored the role
since perceptions of interactional fairness are af fec ted among other things by the dissemination of information see for an example shaw wild and then providing top management with an impartial mechanism through which to enhance vertical organizational communication has the po ten ti al to provide foundation for greater levels of this fairness dimension
unlike distributive or pro ce dural dimensions interactional fairness is supported through improved information sharing and per cep ti ons of interpersonal treatment
outcomes delivered to top management as result of the adoption of an organizational ombudsman at american medical appear to have strengthened both of these core in ter actional fairness components
thus it is proposed that the organizational ombudsman has the capacity to enhance an interactional fairness climate by improving macro level communication and infusing managerial slogans with meaning
conclusions for the most part when practitioners and scholars refer to fairness in the context of the org ani zati on al ombudsman they are referring to the quality of specific level interactions
the standard of practice is good case in point
the underlying assumption inherent to this standard of practice and to the traditional view of the ombudsman is that this organizational institution affects fairness at the point of contact with individual disputants employees and managers
this article sets forth the argument that in addition to this conception of the fair ness role and responsibilities there is also the po ten ti al for broader and more macro level relationship to the overall fairness climate in an organization
volumes of fairness and justice scholarship have documented the multidimensional nature of this central organizational phenomenon
different faces of fairness distributive procedural and interactional are affected by different antecedents
furthermore perceptions of each of these fairness dimensions have been linked to important organizational outcomes
thus increasing levels of perceived fairness is likely to both benefit employees and managers alongside the organization in general
as such it is not surprising that scholars and practitioners have sought to better understand the factors that influence fairness per ce pt ions in general and those that affect each of its dimensions in particular
interestingly despite the in tuitive linkages between the organizational om buds central roles and each of these dimensions of fairness there has been almost no empirical research around these relationships
the well established fair ness research provides unique foundation on which to highlight the organizational role in new under explored and more nuanced light
instead of merely assessing the relationship between the ombudsman and general notion of fairness link ages can be made between the inner workings of this institution and delineated perceptions of fairness
building on evidence from the american medical case study it is argued that the organizational om buds man can influence fairness by affecting different gains across different key stake holders groups
in the american medical case the ombudsman engaged in different activities that resulted in gains for front line staff middle and top management
front line staff relied on the ombudsman to address individual level conflicts and disputes
resolving these disputes is likely to contribute to organizational perceptions of enhanced levels distributive fairness in addition to other types of fairness
middle managers relied on the ombudsman as powerful facilitator for organization al coordination in the midst of intense restructuring
in doing so the ombudsman was among many other benefits providing for foundation for improved per ce pt ions of procedural fairness
finally this study doc ume nt ed the ability of the ombudsman to improve communication channels between top management and the organization
this outcome which appears to improve the knowledge and information flow across the organization is likely to have positive effect on the perceptions of interactional fairness
taken together it is proposed that the organizational ombudsman when addressing multiple stakeholder needs is likely to contribute to the overall fairness perceptions of employees supervisors and managers in an organization
clearly this proposition requires additional empirical support
furthermore future journal of the international ombudsman association ariel avg ar ombudsman research should also continue to unpack the complex relationship between this increasingly prevalent organizational institution and multiple measures of fairness
more specifically there are number of issues that call for additional attention
first the case study documented in this article high lights the positive relationship between ombudsman activities and perceptions of fairness
this is largely due to the best practice nature of this study
never the less if as is proposed above the ombudsman can enhance perceptions of fairness it should follow that this institution can also have negative effect on such outcomes
in other words where the ombudsman does not address multi stakeholder needs it is pos sib le that perceptions of fairness are damaged
den ce supporting this possible negative relationship would contribute the discussion regarding the need to focus on the skills and abilities of the ombudsman and the associated quality of their performance
second it is also possible that existing perceptions of fairness will affect the ability to perform their core duties and responsibilities
in other words there is likely reciprocal relationship between the ombudsman and organizational perceptions of fairness
evidence supporting this relationship would assist in explaining variation in ombudsman adoption levels and implementation and usage quality
finally this study has focused on perceptions of fairness as opposed to more objective measures of or ga ni zati on al fairness such as resource allocations and equity across members
clearly perceptions of fair ness are an important measure in their own right and can serve as proxy for more objective assessment of organizational fairness
nevertheless it is important to incorporate additional and more concrete mea sures of fairness that can complement and extend the evidence provided above regarding the relationship between the ombudsman and organizational fairness

introduction during my tenure as university ombudsman from to often attended meetings of persons in similar roles throughout the usa and canada
in our discussions about our work it was common to hear the word and as an academic with primary focus on religious ethics occasionally spoke up on various meanings of the term
this led to presentations at as il omar and national meetings in cl ud ing conference in portland oregon where spoke of and injustice definitions inclusions and difficult issues
again in san fr an cisco california in led forum on understanding fundamental value
om buds col leagues who participated in some of those sessions urged me to do this article on particularly relating to the international ombudsman assoc ia ti on emphasis on and in its code of ethics and standards of practice
this article draws on some outstanding scholars who have published work on meanings categories and applications of
it includes applications to om buds work and also assumes that thoughtful readers will reflect on many ways that these concepts relate to their work
the university and college om buds association one of the organizations that preceded the international ombudsman association adopted statement of ethical principles which began with the assertion that ombudsperson should be guided by the follow ing principles objectivity independence accessibility confidentiality and justice justice is
journal of the international ombudsman association robert shel ton after discussing the other principles the statement moved to its concern proposing that the person assigned the om buds role be guided by concern for and commitment to justice
justice requires that individual interests be carefully balanced with the consideration of the good of the larger academic community
this commitment to justice should include the understanding of power identification of the use and misuse of power and authority and recognition of the need for access to power by the members of the institution
those of us with om buds experience are certainly familiar with attempts to many types of individual interests with varieties of understandings of needs and goods of the community within which those in dividual interests are attempting to be lived out
and misuse of power and as well as nit ion of the need for access to
are not at all uncommon features in discussions in the om buds office
many claims about abusive use of power were brought to my office
discussions often moved to also recognizing power available to the complainer and constructive uses of such power
of course involved careful consideration of uses of power in ways that seemed more acceptable to the than had been experienced
these and many related conversations involved various understandings of
this paper primarily draws on studies of justice tur ed in writings by mohammed ab uni mer david holl en bach karen james douglas stu rm and howard
in exploring aspects of the ombudsman functions and experience it is helpful to consider the basic historical understandings of types of justice developed by david holl en bach com mu tat ive distributive and social justice
commutative justice he wrote fidelity to agreements contracts or promises made between persons or groups outside the political or public pro cess
the source of obligation felt by parties to such understandings is in formed mutual bonds and fairness in exchange
the fundamental equality of persons is assumed allowing free beings to enter into relations of mutual interdependence just as is the reality of the environments within which om buds men are functioning
justice then is an expression in the sphere of private interaction of both the genuine dignity of all persons and the need for mutuality based on equality in their relationships and agreements
much of what is done in om buds work requires the exploration of assumptions and expectations held by grieving party or parties regarding informal or un of agreements or promises
often the grievant assumes an equality in the relationship and expects fairness in interaction with others in daily ef forts
what he or she has experienced however is the response or action of others to be an attempt to deny or abrogate that equity and the accompanying fair ness within interdependence
academic govern men tal business and community institutions with their widely differing power positions and relationships offer many opportunities for confusion about equality and mutuality as well as opportunities for differing perceptions of what is required for recognition of and response to dignity of persons
distributive justice according to holl en bach as sum es participation by all in the
it the claim which all persons have to some share in those goods that are essentially public or social
this tradition the equal right of all to share in all those goods and opportunities that are necessary for genuine participation in the human community
it establishes strict duty of society as whole to guarantee these rights
especially crucial in the academic institution is assurance of access to op port unities and resources that are basic to the being as well as potential productivity of the institution and its members
major portion of any day may well be spent in aiding persons in learning of the opportunities and resources them in how to access and use them and helping to open up avenues for their utilization of what is there for them
this may also involve finding ways to hold the ins ti tu ti on and its officials accountable for adequate pro tec ti on of such rights and for assuring they are extended to persons often excluded from full participation
crucial consideration of justice in relation to om buds ing is that of social justice
it is here that we come to the institutionalized patterns that are necessary to realize distributive justice
holl en bach suggests that in some traditions of moral philosophy social justice is virtue
it leads to citizens being obligated to in the creation of patterns of societal organization and activity that are essential journal of the international ombudsman association robert shel ton both for the protection of minimal human rights and for the creation of mutuality and participation by all in social
the om buds office is often involved in attempts to formulate or restructure regulations and formal procedures that are more adequate reflections of the virtue
an position description may include the recommendation of policy and procedures that will alleviate circumstances that lead to filing of grievances
when involved in such task one is involved in social justice
burdens of justice fascinating recent work by james the burdens of justice is discussion of distributive justice but he gives it what douglas stu rm in the foreword calls illuminating twist
where distributive justice is usually considered as concerned with allocation of goods and privileges has chosen to focus on the allocation of pains and burdens since the com mon life created by social goods is shaped decisively by its harmful features
thus he is pushing the questions not only of the order of social adv an tag es but also of social
his own de scription of his central theses are first that justice is the chief personal and social moral virtue and the persons and communities bear the burden of culti vat ing it second that just allocation of the advantages and disadvantages of social goods is the chief virtue of communities and that striving to achieve dis tri bu justice is one of the burdens that fall primarily on community leaders and third that the decisive test of distributive justice is how the disadvantages and burdens are arranged
the productive ti on ing of university social institution business or government agency certainly requires that individual persons as well as the diverse communities which make up the larger community the of cultivating justice
what it means to that is seldom articulated within the institution although cal insights and abound and can when properly reflected upon con tribute to just decisions and actions
the are seen by as having direct resp on si or for consciously moving toward the just arrangement of disadvantages and burdens
the or of administrators or others with authority and power over others is sometimes ac knowledged among those in such positions but usu ally ignored or discounted by others who must live with their decisions
an intriguing development in my experience as university ombudsman was the in cre as ing number of contacts by administrators or instr uc tors struggling with decision that would definitely arrange or rearrange burdens and disadvantages for others while it was assumed meeting certain com munity values and expectations
they might phone me or seek me out informally at chance meeting or refer the person most directly effected by the action to me for counsel and await my call to them
however it happened the conversation eventually focused on dilemmas faced by one who must respond to external expectations in our case the state as well as the university
often these expectations were expressed in certain procedural rules which may well be in conflict with generally recognized institutional values andor that own sense of justice
it was ap parent that the ombudsman was seen as one with whom it was to expose the pain or discomfort of decision and action and who would assist in holding the justice commitments squarely in place while pr ac tical social requirements were considered carefully thought through with possible alternatives and dealt with
very helpful was observation that participants will need to identify community habits that restrict their freedom
not all members of the community are equally well suited for the task of negotiating such impediments
some may bear the burden of changing their habits to show that they stand for the public interest as well as for wanting their views to be respected
standards for justice decisions be discoverable within the community and policies cannot be governed by appeals to norms that are extrinsic to the participants
om buds often have to listen carefully for the norms and values of the participants that will allow them to move toward justice
in situation of student charged by an instructor with plagiarism on paper turned in near the end of the semester it was clear that the student had used sources
it was also clear that some circumstances journal of the international ombudsman association robert shel ton that were offered by the course structure for resource assistance had somewhat confused what was and was not
when the instructor expressed that the issue had happened earlier in the semester so that the student could simply have been required to redo the paper the conversation was di rect ed in such way that the instructor had an opp or to hear herself express that desire again as well as to discuss some of the values involved
this led to exploration of the distribution of disadvantages and burdens that would be required if the student were al lowed to redo the paper although the semester was over as well as the ways in which the and the values regarding plagiarism would be clearly interpreted to and understood by the student
although probably had more weighty com munity issues in mind one of his closing observations is particularly relevant to this case as well as to much that requires an om buds response we will take actions of one sort if our aim is to relationships among imperfect or con ten persons
we will take actions of distinctively different sort if we seek to prevent some groups from shifting their burdens onto other groups
to make lasting corrections we must count on willingness to revise their moral concepts judgments and decisions as well as their actions and the si tua ti ons in which they encounter each other
however we encounter each other we always encounter one moral understandings about allocating social goods
from injustice to justice after having explored six theories of justice karen began her more recent book us tice in an unjust world with the insistence that my reflections on justice must begin with the realities of injustice
have long been convinced that injustice is our lived reality and that it is therefore the primary category
justice emerges as the cry of revolt against injustice
an approach to justice must therefore begin with injustice
commonly heard phrase in the om buds office usu ally expressed with considerable emotion is just fair
or only somewhat less often is real injustice
it is only with an adequate understanding of how that person is experiencing reality deemed to be unfair andor unjust that beginning move can be made toward the possibility of at least some justice
in opening lines it is acknowledged that her breath is compromise with in jus thus she asserts the claim which many experience would certainly confirm that injustice is somewhat built into the hierarchical structure of the institution
most clients who confer with an om buds man will sooner or later voice that reality
those per sons are living within functioning within structures that require many different kinds of activities forms of interaction and uses of power
participants are required by aspects of the system to pursue what be come competing interests in an environment that is not prepared to productively utilize the competition
among the many rich insights offered by in this study is distinction between the two worlds in which persons live described by peasant leader as birds flying freely and rapidly in the air and fish swim ming more slowly within the confines and ob str uc ti ons of the sea
asserts that although she is sometimes among the fish she is in most of her life one of the and must consciously adopt to be sufficiently in touch with to feel with to think with to experience life as the in order to approach justice
the openness to such is regular requirement for one doing the om buds task and is challenge that is constantly put before other flying more or less freely within the institution
first of theory of justice that emerges from taking injustice seriously is that the theory must be very broad and can stand on no th ing less than relationship
what is the re between instructor and student between manager and employee
the second in sis ts that justice reside in responsibilities and du ties not in rights
persons in community are bound together by covenant of mutual responsibility one that implies for one another
an discussion with student or employee about any thing other than can sometimes be difficult
in the university helping the student understand the student role as one in which there are responsibilities toward other students and the instructor can be challenge
likewise how an instructor facing class with hundreds of students can do so with covenantal in recognition that the of each de pends on the is test of daily pressures over journal of the international ombudsman association robert shel ton against what is probably strong internal motivation very close to that ideal
third that the injustice is re cog domination and oppression as of covenant of mutual responsibility
the hours spent in listening to the pain of those in various forms of minority power status and attempting to work with them in their part of the while enc our ag ing others who are an active part of the breach of covenant to attend to their responsibilities have brought alive what she says about the necessity for both and
her fourth insists that the struggle for justice by the oppressed consists in resistance to forms of oppression and in actions con sonant with liberation as the goal
justice for the oppressor consists in rebuke and requisition
those responsible for injustice have the duty of redress of making amends setting things right
this includes not only ending the exploitation or oppression but making reparations for the harms caused by past injustices
both together participate in the restoration of the proper order of relationships in which exp lo ita ti on and domination would not exist
those who perceive themselves as having been op pressed harmed improperly treated cheated held back so many terms are used to describe the ex peri en ce may seek rescue or in many cases sugg es ti ons and support for resistance that aids self empowerment
the ombudsman may also be urged to assist in arranging rebuke and provision of re para ti ons in whatever form is appropriate to the situation
occasionally the person who has become aware of serving as oppressor through institutional exp ec ta ti ons asks the om buds for guidance in moving out of this status and restoring covenant in the community and within the suffering victim
final acknowledges that jus tice is always incomplete and partial leading to the requirement for and as crucial in any theory of justice as well as in attempts for just decision and action
such recognition is of some solace when in the midst of following the seeming resolution of an unjust circumstance the reality remains that the history strongly suggests the likelihood of the reoccurrence
nonetheless om buds have clearly seen the two levels of about which she writes
in specific in stance of student struggling with bureaucratic and human staff entanglements that produced major course credit issue threatening her scheduled gra du ati on her was clearly apparent in the midst of the struggle as she claimed her identity repudiated her oppressors the truth and moving toward it
this of resolve and allowed her to stay after what seemed to be impenetrable odds and to request assistance in the formulation of language for her appeal as well as consideration of the work cir cum stances of those with whom she must deal
when her problem was resolved justly for and with her she entered the joy of and described by and clearly emerged an even stronger per son while at the same time expressing her confidence in and love for the community whose covenant had somehow remained vital reality for her
justice as individual and collective identity douglas stu rm has contributed in brief form some basic notions about justice that are particularly help in thinking through the realities of conflict man age ment
in his foreword to the volume he notes that
justice is in the philosophical language of the western intellectual tradition an ontologically grounded principle
it is statement of our identity both individually and collectively
it betokens some thing about our fundamental condition as denizens of cosmos in which we all belong together
the obligatoriness of justice is grounded in the most basic character of our life
to be ourselves in the fullest and most complete sense is to be just
in the presence of justice we are all enriched in the absence of jus tice we are all deprived
justice is quality of human stature injustice is indicative of human failure
it is not unusual in the experience to find oneself in the position of for someone who wants to the right to do so
persons who are in complex org ani zati on often find themselves torn between what seem to be compelling requirements of their function and their own innate sense of justice their identity with journal of the international ombudsman association robert shel ton others their need to be as full self as possible
when an institution specifically establishes an office out side the hierarchical structure and with access to the entire system with the expectation that this person is to keep an eye on the whole rooted in the values and conscience of the institution persons will turn to that office to relieve the tension produced by their role in the organization and help them to be just
in an earlier writing book entitled community and alienation stu rm briefly described four meanings of justice that he has found most important in ex ami nation of community
his discussions of justice as liberty as equality as community and as wisdom have number of parallels with the work of and in that the apparent contradictions between the varying meanings of justice nonetheless come together in nature
stu rm concludes his discussion of justice by pointing out that is not only virtue of social institutions it is as well primary virtue of personal character
he then translates the principles of justice into of character creativity respect empathy and humility which constitute the substance of civility
when many are bemoaning an increasing absence of civility in society as whole and on higher education cam puses and work places in particular the ombudsman is aware of increasing opportunities to explore these attributes and their accompanying actions with variety of persons in the midst of their lives as citizens of the community
loss and sacrifice in seeking justice one who serves in the om buds position has un doubtedly listened to experiences of both from persons with less power who are in pain over their inability to gain what they know they have coming to them and persons whose power positions have led them into actions they realize are producing difficulty for others
the less powerful person is carrying the burden of actual loss and the more powerful person wants to explore what form of loss or sacrifice he or she can take on to be of desired benefit to the other
each of our authors has given attention to the experience of loss that is inescapable in the search and struggle for justice
whether one is oppressed or oppressor the movement toward productive and positive change will involve inevitable aspects of loss
stu rm especially notes the importance of inherent in analysis of balancing burdens and reminds his readers that in its nature is an act of giving
work warns that we must be careful who does the
at the same time it is clear that any comprehension of justice in its full ness will include the experience of of sa cr ality in with loss whose intent and effect constitute
each of these writers sets particular goal for anyone assigned the om buds role in an institution articulated by stu rm
we acknowledge and respect our deep differences yet are brought together in community commit ted to walking in justice with one another and to sharing in the joys and to allocating the burdens of our common life in such way that the lives of all are enriched with qualitative meaning
restorative justice in recent decades the concept of has become significant in many aspects of human conflict from and reconciliation to many types of community methods for dealing with human damages to and from others
often drawing on ancient traditions throughout the world people have identified ways to meet the needs of victims offenders and community members in the face of injustices
number of publications are available for cons id erat ion of this topic including very useful text by howard the little book of restorative justice
the book is full of important considerations ap pli cable to many aspects of the om buds function as are others in the series on justice and peace building
more than is often recognized person with position provided over others takes action that is experienced as harm by persons over whom resp on is being exercised
the coworker or student is thus who usually with others sees the more journal of the international ombudsman association robert shel ton powerful person as
attempts to restore positive relationships and productivity in the system require considerable insight and understanding
along with harry mi ka concludes the brief sum mara text with principles of restorative justice similar to their of restorative justice both of which draw on susan restorative justice vision for healing and change
emphasizing the difficulty of defining this topic because of its variety of complex factors offers justice is process to involve to the extent possible those who have stake in specific offense and to collectively identify and address harms needs and obligations in order to heal and put things as right as possible
the of adopted by the international ombudsman association is included ombudsman advocates for fair and equitably administered as many have experienced restorative justice approach may sometimes provide steps needed to assure or regain processes of admin ist ration within the system that are experienced as and by participants at various levels

introduction the objective of this manuscript is to id en ti fy the ingredients of fairness according to various ombudsman web sites and selected review of the literature on this topic
the desired goal is for others to recognize the importance of fairness and use it as part of blueprint for best practice
good framework and broad understanding of this sensitive and important issue are the very first steps to take before an ombudsman becomes an effective watchdog of fairness
the words and are used interchangeably throughout this document
the reader should be aware that the citations examples and web sites about equitableness have government ombudsman orientation
in spite of this the author strongly believes that fairness characteristics can be universally applied and equally relevant to other om buds man associations or groups including org ani za ti on al ombudsmen
the concept of universal application was resonated by john as fairness in
he revisited the pluralism in society regarding morality religion and philosophy
raw ls cham pi on ed that society should organize system where its populace would experience fair and just outcomes without prior consideration of race religion and philosophy
he argued that if individuals really differ on these things then how is it that people are able to live together in democratic society
raw ls well recognized harvard philosopher originally presented this idea during thought experiment in
his research study resulted in publication entitled theory of justice
ma ie se heralded the fact that justice and fairness in the context of intractable conflict are mutually inclusive in many instances
the questions pertaining to fairness affect most if not all types of ombudsmen
who decides what is fair and by what criteria are some of the issues discussed in this profession
in essence it does not really matter the guide to fairness gerald pa pica journal of the international ombudsman association gerald pa pica whether work is in government organizational corporate or educational ombudsman setting
the overarching goal of an ombudsman is problem re so lut ion or addressing the issues at hand
the notice able variances among ombudsmen are the tools used and the outcomes they are trying to achieve
the function jurisdiction method and product are some of the basic traits that differentiate one ombudsman from another
an experienced ombudsman knows that the subject of fairness lies in the eyes of the beholder
its imp le mentation however is in the hands of the admin is tr at or or company employee
what is seemingly an equitable solution to provider of service may not be the same to its recipient
applied in the workplace this observation was shared by ken bu ch when he stated each person deems inter pret ed differently on the perspective of who is view ing the in most cases the etiology of the problem is the gap between what was said in con versation and how it was applied
this is the basis of contention among aggrieved citizens and dissatisfied customers
therefore an ombudsman has mandate to ensure that the entire process was applied fairly that is from the point the referral was received to the moment the issue was resolved
fairness is all about the right thing to do and may not always correspond with doing things right
good organizations balance policy implementation and its impact on others
as harbingers of fair treatment how will the ombudsman uphold an aura of equitableness between the individual with concerns and the agency that defers to policies and procedures to justify why certain decisions were made
to answer these ques ti ons action steps based on prudence and sound evidence are needed
juries in civil courtrooms resort to settling disputes by awarding successful litigants with financial remuneration
this situation has been the bastion of the judicial system in the western world for many decades
bu ch stated that people aim for compensation through litigation in situations where equitable treatment was not present
in sam ombudsman how good governments handle recognized that some complainants focus more on the fun da mental problems connected to the of the policy itself or its implementation in
he stressed that the government has ongoing struggles to treat constituents and to earn their support
zag or ia encouraged that time spent with an ombudsman is wise investment for many individuals instead of settling differences and grievances in the courtroom
during his academic research zag or ia observed that ombudsmen are ea ger to help other people and strongly believe in what they are doing
the positive psychological effect of perceived fairness is difficult to measure because research about this is sue is scarce tabi bn ia sa tp ute and lie berm an
gu th sch mitt berger and sch warse posited in study called ultimatum that people are naturally to fairness over and above its con sequences for material tabi bn ia et
tabi bn ia and his cohorts argued that individuals are intensely in tune with this topic
these research ers suggest that people naturally seek and expect fair treatment
social scientists have concluded that seeking eq ui table ness or justice is basic human yearning
to practitioner it is complex issue requiring middle of the road strategy and maturity
in the ombudsman profession rigidity or inflexibility do not belong to the arena of fairness
the ombudsman has crucial role to seek encourage and facilitate equitableness in skill empathetic trustworthy and confident manner
traditions of fairness individually and collectively society has gained knowledge about the concept of fairness by learning from wise men and scholars
such wisdom ger mi nat ed in the form of parables anecdotes and stories that have withstood the test of time
just like the gi ta and the rama yana confucius ar is tot le and king solomon have taught countless men and women from varied backgrounds how to lead life from birth to death justly and fairly
the golden rule is globally respected practice dat ing back thousands of years
doing unto others what you would have others do unto you is encouraged by many cultures religions and philosophies
it is found in the bible matthew buddhism and ancient china where confucius was attributed with popularizing this idea
constitutional rights foun da ti on
the golden rule is great example of how fairness could be embodied in everyday life
journal of the international ombudsman association gerald pa pica alle sandra and co wrote book and coined an idea they called platinum rule
treat ing other people in manner that they want to be treated is the backbone of their seminal work
accord ing to these authors this practice is preferable and an alternative to the golden rule because it factors in the feelings of other individuals
it is rather difficult to talk about equitableness without mentioning ethics and justice
nicomachean ethics on law and morality guided men on how they should live in civil society and assist them to become outstanding citizens an as tap lo
he stressed that moral virtues in their truest form are practical through the deeds of men
aristotle explained that morality is dependent on the law to institute justice and fairness
during biblical times the wisdom of king solomon exemplified justice when he settled dispute be tween two women both claiming to be the mother of an infant the book of kings me lac him
his decision to cut the baby in two and give one half to each woman was extreme and appeared heartless
nevertheless it was also fairness in its literal and sym bol ic forms
king solomon did not take much time to figure out the real parent of the child
the resolution of the problem and the essence of the story is lesson that permeates many social settings
confucius ar is tot le and king solomon demonstrated equitableness during various eras
they proved that fairness is not something temporal or exclusive to specific period of time or civilization
fairness in negotiations and justice he sl in of the australian graduate school of management listed four types of fairness issues during negotiations journal of st james ethics so
they include structural fairness process fairness procedural fairness and outcome fairness
he emphasized that equitableness judgments about whether principles of ethical were taken into consideration
structural fairness is all about the physical social and issue constraints where negotiations are happening
physical constraints include the location of the meet ing access to information technical support and public probing or scrutiny in regard to the freedom of information act
he sl in included re pres en ta ti on setting the agenda communication between vested individuals and the outside world and dead lines or time limits as structural impediments
process fairness imposes honestly implementing agreements without resorting to deception or co er cion
he ls in posited that it is fair to misrepresent interest and offer alternatives
this is contingent upon sufficient notification along with implicit as well as explicit understanding from them that the rules are being modified
in this context sent ing really implies introduction of different solution compared with what the client originally wants as an outcome
according to he sl in procedural fairness dictates that integrative differentiating interests and positions and distributive procedures allocation of the dis put ed resource are active components
if pro ce dural unfairness is perceived it has the capacity to dismantle the process and undermine the outcome
if implemented properly the principles of equity proportional equality impartial or comparable and need or redistributive justice the least fortunate gets the most share lead to outcome fairness
andre shanks and me yer issues in ethics suggested three kinds of justice as it relates to fairness
distributive justice ensuring that benefits and burdens are distributed among society in just and fair way
retributive or corrective justice the extent to which punishments are fair and just
compensatory justice the extent to which people are fairly compensated for injuries suffered
journal of the international ombudsman association gerald pa pica ombudsman fairness checklist the forum of canadian ombudsman first an nu al conference in april was held in ottawa ontario
howard the former ombudsman of british columbia was the speaker for session called fairness checklist
he en um er ated these criteria to determine if equitableness has transpired
communication information is available and understandable forms are in plain language clients are provided with information they need and clients are treated with courtesy
facilities and services telephones are answered timely other means of com munic ati on are available the office is easily accessible environment is safe and healthy and privacy is observed
decision procedures decision makers have chance to give information and evidence to support their stance decisions are done within reasonable amount of time and rea sons for the decisions are explained
appeal review and complaint procedures people are told immediately of any existing appeal or review complaints procedures are clearly defined and solicitation of ideas from the public to improve services
organizational issues staff are given clear titles for the role that they assume in the organization agencies consider if re org ani za ti on would amplify the quality of service and interagency cooperation is nurtured
agency review and planning public participation in program planning is enc our aged explanation is provided from the beginning about how decision making process is reached and provision of data needed to evaluate and improve performance is archived
unlike organizational ombudsmen who function as designated neutrals public sector ombudsman offices advocate for their constituency and make the auto no mo us decision about the complaints presented to their attention
the web page of the ombudsman of fice of the northern territory government in australia delineated clear commitments that focus on fairness
when complaints are received the ombudsman com plies with the following practices
you will be treated fairly and with respect
you will be given the right to be heard during the complaint process
our decisions will be balanced taking into account all available evidence and points of view
we will explain our decision and reasons to you
you can request review of any decision or conc lu sion we have reached about your complaint
promoting fairness by the saskatchewan provincial ombudsman this section is most beneficial to government ombudsmen who plan to herald fairness by using as model the office of the provincial ombudsman in saskatchewan canada
few years ago the office released page booklet entitled brief explanation
it identified specific items that will help the ombudsman assess if the government acted fairly in accordance with section of ombudsman and advocate act
the list includes sonable contrary to law unjust oppressive im prop er ly discriminatory and based on mistake of law or fact or wrong
describes inconsistency in decisions made in similar cases inconsistency with the sig ni fi can ce of the evidence decisions that cannot be ex plained and unintended effect or consequences
the booklet recognized that having outcomes contrary to law is one of the most complicated subject matters to resolve because legislation is involved
inappropriate punitiveness is criterion for being unjust
the con se qu en ce of decisions might exceed the circumstance surrounding case
oppression happens when exp ec tat ions have overwhelmed or overburdened an in di vidual to the point that compliance becomes im pos sib le
discrimination occurs when government adds requirements that are unnecessary to meet the goals
journal of the international ombudsman association gerald pa pica in reverse circumstance it also transpires when the government fails to treat individuals with the same situation equally
here the contrast between mistakes of fact and law are important but they do not have much influence on the ombudsman when fairness is being considered
the saskatchewan ombudsman office has produced page workbook called fine art of fairness guide for fair practice
it can be downloaded via their web site at
caup loads document files fair practices workbook een
the web site exists to encourage its users to freely ac cess information about fairness and to apply them in their respective offices
another intended product of the web site is to foster public awareness how eq ui table ness is applied
and io iw hen it comes to supporting fairness expressed in core standards there are tenets common among the united states ombudsman association international ombudsman association and international ombudsman institute
the north oldest public sector ombudsman organization corporate educational govern ment agency international and nongovernment organization and international group of govern ment ombudsmen have similar missions but each group operates differently
hence the daily function and ultimate goal for ombudsmen in these org ani za ti ons also varies
they were selected by the author as examples because of their jurisdiction prominence in the community and shared features
this observation was reflected in frank thesis where he indicated that the standards of both united states ombudsman association and international ombudsman association are si mi lar
autonomy neutrality and confidentiality are guid ing principles of both organizations
he documented that and agree on three of four basic stan dar ds
the point of divergence transpires with the fourth standard credible review process
fowl ie explained that has classical ombudsman out look and the has an organizational persona
while the former is heavily reliant on formal investigation the latter uses an informal approach
he stressed that has or multidiscipline whose task also include human rights ombudsman in tandem with governmental functions
administrative fairness plus procedural fairness equals outcome fairness in accordance with the review of the literature and web sites of several government ombudsman offices in canada australia hong kong england and the usa there are common attributes when it comes to sound principles and best practices concerning fairness
ombudsman organizations work under the core assumption that the achievement of equitable ness is founded on well crafted administrative guide lines and efficient dignified procedures to implement action plans
fairness is the true spirit of ombudsman ship
to maintain this ideal the ombudsman must be adept in what to look for and be tactful at offering resolutions or alternatives in timely fashion
ing the moment or carpe diem are the axioms in the ombudsman arena
this formula simply translates to coordinated balanced and harmonious combination of admin is tr at ive fairness and procedural fairness which in turn will produce outcome fairness
as proper steps procedures follow the dictum of sound policies administrative they consequently point towards good outcome
in other words wise administrative decisions that were procedurally executed via proper conduits almost always result in fair satisfactory outcome
the succeeding pages embellished what these ideas entail
in the office of the ombudsman city of web page administrative fairness means that individuals or agencies have the right to know what is the nature of the complaint against them to make sufficient no journal of the international ombudsman association gerald pap ic ati fi cation to foster the right to presentation hearings or meetings and to explain why certain decisions are finalized
administrative unfairness is about unreason able delay failure to implement the planned course of action not adhering to established procedures not disseminating adequate information misleading or imprecise statements and problematic application of policy procedure and practice
the web page defined maladministration as omissions decisions and that produce im proprieties poor service and bad management
the alberta ombudsman firmly believes that justice and administrative are the precursors of an investigation
their web page listed the follow ing administrative fairness chain of legislative duty of participation adequate reasonable apprehension of legislative exercise discretionary reasonable decision the office of the ombudsman in hong kong also enumerated the criteria that make up the administrative ethics sense of responsibility and making of honesty and professionalism and public courtesy equality and loyalty and economy and environmental administrative fairness includes acknowledging the rules of the games and tools used in addressing or resolving issues
the duty to be fair and offer equal treatment as well as opportunity to all complainants regardless of their color ethnicity creed religious belief political affiliation gender orientation eco nomic strata etc
are some of the more pronounced traits embedded in administrative fairness
common courtesy civility responsibility honesty integrity accountability public interest and participation are characteristics that belong to administrative fairness
the ombudsman western australia described that procedural fairness is interested in actions used by decision makers and not the outcome per se
their web page stressed that equitable procedures have precedence over the actual end result
this principle suggests that if service provider employs fair pro ce dure it will naturally lead to just decision
the ombudsman western australia adheres to the following procedural opportunity to reply that is appropriate to the situ ati on
responses to be received and considered before any final decision
receive pertinent information in preparation for reply
reasonable chance to consider decision and response
genuine consideration of everything that was writ ten or stated
receive information that the case is being heard and what is being considered
genuine chance to reply to the case being heard before final decisions are rendered
after all valid information is gathered the right to respond about decisions made
open mindedness of decision makers when read ing listening and making decisions
the manitoba ombudsman web page identified these features exclusive to procedural individuals are given advance notification
individuals are told what information will be used in the decision
individuals are provided with real opportunity to present case
individuals are given chance to challenge or dis pu te any decision
decision makers review the case thoroughly and thoughtfully
journal of the international ombudsman association gerald decision makers are impartial and unbiased with out personal interest or stake
decision makers offer insightful and understand able reasons for the decision
zag or ia argued that cases normally start from issues about of decisions made through established procedures
procedural fairness describes the series of action plans and how they were carried out every step of the way
this begins from the mo ment the complaint was received and ends with how the situation was resolved or addressed
logging the referral doing initial research or fact finding notify ing agencies or individuals gathering information convening meetings making decisions distributing findings and writing recommendations if applicable all encompass procedural fairness
outcome fairness is the natural byproduct of fair po li and procedures
to ensure the equitableness of desired result or expected outcome the sequential steps or process involved in the arrival of solution need scrutiny by the ombudsman
closely exam in ing the process gives more significance to just or fair outcome williams
williams posited that if agreed upon rules were followed as well as imp le ment ed without bias and there was voluntary or team participation any outcome is justified
according to skit ka win quist and hutch in son there is perception out there that outcome fairness is similar to outcome favorability
meta analytic review of the justice literature proved otherwise
these researchers learned that there are empirical dif fer enc es or distinguishable traits between them
they presented the following study impressions
the fair process effect is significantly weaker when the criterion is outcome fairness than when it is outcome favorability
outcome fairness consistently explained sig ni fi cant ly more variance than did outcome favorability across various measures including organizational commitment organizational citizenship and job satisfaction
outcome fairness for the most part had as strong and sometimes stronger effects than voices and procedural fairness across different dependent measures
al identified marked differences between outcome fairness and outcome favorability
the former has significant variances that are free from the influence of the latter
additionally outcome vari ables trump procedural variables and not vice versa
it is not recommended nor good idea to confuse these two topics as one and the same
the researchers gested that outcome fairness should receive equal intense attention just like procedural fairness
conclusion transparency is the foundation of fairness
it is virtually impossible to be equitable without being open and honest
the public and consumers of ser vices should have the ability to see through as well as understand what is going on
there has to be en ce between what you are doing action and what you are accomplishing outcome
now more than ever transparency is widely encouraged and gaining popularity and public support especially with regard to the expected behavior of public servants and ser vice providers
the newly elected governor of tennessee in cre ated his own spreadsheet and crunched the numbers as the public watched him in action
this example of transparency and financial management style reportedly instilled public confidence and resulted in two gubernatorial terms
exemplified by many other progressive minded politicians in this country pro ac as well as open governments are good accept able indicators of fairness
as stated in white house memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies openness in government is major commitment of the current administration
the president mandated that the ex ec ut ive branch work together in order to gain public trust via system of transparency public ti on and collaboration
he indicated that trans par ency promotes accountability and offers information about what the government is doing
as ordered this memorandum is published in the us federal register
in november page of the chil commissioner by john dun ford named the paris principles and un convention on the rights of the child as bulwarks for ensuring that rights of children are safeguarded
in his report which journal of the international ombudsman association gerald pa pica was presented to the british parliament dun ford documented that children and young people re ported feeling that they are not fairly represented about decisions that influence them
he re com mended that it is important that the business planning process is transparent and involved external
dun ford further encouraged that the commissioner should always be aware of personal responsibility and accountability
from the federal to the state level and beyond transparency is becoming an expected and com mon practice
this is where the ombudsman can play pivotal role
the need to become the guardian of fairness could not come in more opportune time
protecting the best interest of society and individuals is worthwhile mission
this task fits the ombudsman regardless of jurisdiction and methodology
in summary the pros and cons or differences about the issue of equitableness dwell in the imp le men tat ion of its characteristics
filing grievance that fairness was not practiced is relatively easier move to make
however finding resolution based on con sensus is harder end result to achieve
as forums on equitableness take shape the locus of the discussion should be on the desired fair outcome acceptable to the aggrieved party
preserving sound agency po li and encouraging best practice are challenges for many ombudsmen whose duty is to remind everyone that fairness rules

the author would like to thank mary ro we alan lincoln brian block david miller and laurie paters on for their support and encouragement to write about standard of the international ombudsman as sociation standards of practice
he would also like to thank mary rudolph for reminding him that he actually did understand and practice according to standard of practice in several specific situations
reread an article wrote years ago during my first year as an ombudsman
it was called of first year ombudsman
wrote it in about nine months into my first year on the job
as reread this article could see that even back then while was learning lot as new ombudsman was also confused about some specific aspects of neutrality
and sadly it was clear that assumed that all of this confusion would probably clear up once had little more experience
the truth is years simply been enough time for the confusion to dissipate
but one thing years of experience has led me to believe is that it is very likely am not alone in this confusion
that is significant reason why found sense of community with colleagues in the university and college ombudsman association the california caucus of college and university om buds and in the international ombudsman as sociation
in spite of my longstanding awareness of feeling confused about neutrality more about that later could not resist saying to the request of such an esteemed colleague as david talbot few years ago to consider joining an outstanding group of col leagues who serve as instructors for om buds course
after all despite my confusion about neutrality did feel had learned great deal about the role of organizational ombudsman
and have always heard the best way to really learn something is to teach it
suppose it was inevitable that sooner or later would find myself teaching the section on neutrality
that happened last summer when the course was taught as part of the strauss dispute resolution summer institute at pepper dine university
while preparing for that presentation reviewed standards of practice on neutrality impartiality and one phrase seemed to jump off the page laugh in my face and accuse me of being an imposter
journal of the international ombudsman association om of practice which said om buds man advocates for fair and equitably administered processes and does not advocate on behalf of any in dividual within the
as usual reading this left me scratching my head
as read and reread it began to wonder how was going to teach anyone anything about this when really understand what it meant
as continued to wonder how would teach new and prospective ombudsmen about this aspect of neutral it occurred to me that aside from our standards of practice document there was another document to which might refer document
knew this document had been devel oped after much thought and discussion by some very experienced colleagues whom have always admired
but when read the document which did fine job of operational izing many other aspects of the om buds role found nothing relating to standard of practice
so began to realize had no answers for the following if ombudsmen are supposed to decide what are and are not and equitably administered processes what criteria do we use to make these decisions
if after deciding process has not been or equitably administered what are for communicating to others that am advocating for and not for any individuals or groups of individuals especially in situations where an or complaint is the basis for my taking action
also wondered why has not had conference presentations professional development courses or journal articles dedicated to explaining it at least none that remembered
further if after years on the job was still confused about this suspected few other colleagues especially new ones may be confused as well
and with great respect to the fine colleagues who tackled the difficult task of creat ing it wondered why this addressed in our document especially given that other aspects of this standard were ope rationalized very clearly
was it assumed every one would simply know how to recognize and equitably administered processes
or was it conf us ing to these colleagues as well
as tried to unpack the sources of my confusion talked to few colleagues and did some journaling too
looked at the other parts of the standard on neutrality impartiality again and recognized that understand most of this standard quite well
could readily see how all of the other aspects of standard have guided my own om buds practice
and after talk ing with one colleague was reminded of two kinds of situations in which even standard had guided my choices when procedures thought would be helpful did not exist eg formal grade appeal procedures or when there had been an apparent failure to follow existing procedures
however also realized that when individuals were the focus of pattern of complaints and the classic example involved allegations that supervisor or professor had engaged in bullying of an employee or graduate student was much less sure about how to avoid conveying the appearance of advocating on behalf of the individual who had complained while simultaneously appearing to advocate against the supervisor or professor
since occasionally found myself in discussions with administrators about these sensitive issues developed checklist of points to cover when talking with them
acknowledged this checklist in an article co wrote with nancy er be in the inaugural journal of the international om buds man association
it included things like remind her or him that am designated neutral and while it may appear that am advocating for the individuals that is not my intention say that none of those who have complained have given me permission to speak with the alleged bully because they all fear retaliation tell her or him that the information have is only anecdotal in nature recommend that in order to be fair to the alleged bully it may be helpful for her or him to gather independent data using tools such as degree evaluation instrument or exit suggest that the administrator consider presenting the findings to the alleged bullying supervisor and give her or him an opportunity to respond and tell her or him that depending on the findings it could be helpful to consider providing coaching or counseling for the alleged bullying supervisor or professor to help him improve in this area of his performance
er be journal of the international ombudsman association om se bo kat first thought the risk of conveying the perception of advocacy only existed when had not even spoken to the alleged bullying supervisor or professor and was going her or him to speak to someone with more authority
but later found that if had spoken to her or him before speaking with an admin is tr at or it seemed to set up an even greater risk that my actions would be seen especially by the person about whom complaints had been made as ad vo ca cy on behalf of those who had made complaints
when became an ombudsman neither the om buds man association toa nor had standards of practice
did have of ethical that in some ways found rather inspiring
unfortunately could not always find the guidance was seeking involving neutrality in this document either
among number of principles identified as important for ombudsmen was cited as
was never clear about whether was intended to be interchangeable with or process
at some point also re mem ber few colleagues asserting that om buds should start with an open mind as neutrals but like judges when the facts were revealed they could draw conclusions and need not be by the obligation to function as neutrals
liked the way this sounded but eventually it sounded like more appro pria te guidance for one who conducts investigations than one in which practitioner has the obligation to avoid the reality or the appearance of advocating for or assumed against individuals
when toa and eventually developed separate ethical standards and standards of practice this did create rationale for certain decisions made about how to best function as neutral
but found that operational izing these standards was never as easy as following the probably secretly wanted
assumed then and still do now that it was sim ply too difficult to anticipate every possible scenario and create standard to address it
in most cases for fair seems to have very little to do with my day today practices as an organizational ombudsman
most of the time engage in one on one conversations with visitors engaged in something very similar to what is now called jones
more than half of the time meet only with individual visitors who typically bring issues that rarely involve allegations that policy or procedure does not exist or was not followed
to determine whether occurred is not request ed required or appropriate to help them
these are individual interpersonal disputes involving perceived violations of trust andor respect and almost always poor or miscommunication
the disputes involve either colleagues andor those in relation ships
and according to initial research conducted by the uniform reporting categories task force this is very common experience among organizational ombudsmen working in educational institutions
fifty two percent of the issues questions or con with which those reporting assisted individuals involved conflicts in or relation ships dale miller
in my own practice the percent of these cases particularly among faculty and staff is probably closer to
typically listen and help these visitors clarify their interests and goals
and help them identify and weigh the advantages and disadvantages of various options
on rare occasions contact another party and mediate these disputes
but am rarely asked to render judgment about whether and eq ui ta administered has occurred
of course unlike the description of modern day jones because am em ployed inside an organization have developed and use knowledge about the organizational culture in assisting visitors in recognizing its norms and values and their obligations rights and options
also when agreed to by all involved engage in mediation where have rarely experienced much confusion about how or whether to operate as tr al
on few occasions have functioned as shuttle diplomat
but describe my role to visitors as one who helps students staff and faculty to manage conflict and if possible to resolve it
do not describe the role nor do consciously act as one who judges who is right or wrong and then advocates for the person who think is right
journal of the international ombudsman association om se bo ki certainly enjoy my work and feel extraordinarily fortunate to have found my way into profession with such terrific group of talented colleagues from wide variety of backgrounds
find it enormously satisfying to assist visitors in seeing options when they saw none previously
have been grateful for the privilege of engaging with students staff and faculty who may be scared sad angry andor confused and helping them find hope and on good days re so lu ti on to what are often quite challenging problems
but standard and prior to its existence seemingly contradictory messages about how and even whether organizational om buds should for fair has often left me feeling as if were stand ing in hall of mirrors
and am guessing am not alone
it time we clarify what we really mean by this standard
in spite of my observations here about standard believe the standards of practice and best practices committee did an outstanding job in creating our standards of practice and developing the document
the clarity provided by these documents places us light years beyond where we were when started in
at this point believe it would be very useful for the board to temp or ar revive this committee or appoint task force with the specific charge of reviewing and clarifying sop
by the way if wondering what did in my pre sent ati on about neutrality at pepper dine thanks to some well developed materials by previous instr uc tors found those with which was most comfortable and focused on them
confess that pretty much ducked standard altogether
and in an effort to inject some levity into the presentation started by singing my spoof version of naturally russell morris on song made famous by buck owe ns and later recorded by the beatles

would also like to thank david miller and three anonymous reviewers for their comments
it goes without saying that the flaws in this essay are mine alone
from the international ombudsman standards of practice the ombudsman strives for impartiality fairness and objectivity in the treatment of people and the consideration of issues
the ombudsman advocates for fair and equitably administered processes and does not advocate on behalf of any individual within the organization
the ombudsman exercises sole discretion over whether or how to act regarding an con cern trend or concerns of multiple individuals over time
in my opinion standard cited above is mistaken and ought to be reconsidered
if we think about how we actually do our work we are forced to ack no wl edge that the boundary between advocating for fair process and advocating for person is not always clear and in some circumstances exercising our discretion includes advocating on behalf of person or even an outcome
in such circumstances not to exercise our discretion in that way would be to shortchange our role as well as the people who come to us for help
now of course agree that we cannot at the outset of any case offer ourselves as advocates for those who come to us for help or counsel
nor should we define ourselves as advocates for any specific group within our organizations eg students or employees
and although section reserves for us discretion over whether or how to act regarding an concern we would never present ourselves as sent ing person or group that has come to us in the way lawyer might represent them
but to my mind there is an important difference between the initial posture we assume when working with someone and the sort of posture we might take after we have looked into or worked on particular case
as see it was just think in gi was just thinking about fairness howard gad lin journal of the international ombudsman association howard gad lin there are circumstances when using our discretion it is appropriate for an ombudsman to advocate not just for fair process but for person or even particular outcome
certainly we are not judges we have no decision making authority to exercise nor do we desire that authority
however the fact that we are not judges does not mean that we do not make judgments
thinking of my own experiences and observing my colleagues it seems clear that we evaluate situations all the time and we frequently make judgments about both si tua ti ons and people those judgments affect how we handle situations and how we react to people
luckily though as ombudsmen we cannot impose our ju dg men ts on others and in almost all circumstances it is inappropriate for us to offer our judgments directly even when asked by those who come to us
indeed our effectiveness lies in the fact that because we can not impose our judgments on others we must find more collaborative ways asking questions discuss ing presenting alternative perspectives facilitating better communication between disputing parties to engage with people so that they might alter the way they see situation or interact with person
we ana cases along many dimensions but any way you look at it there are times when there is link between the judgments we make about fairness and the sorts of interventions we undertake
as ombudsmen our primary focus has to be on the fairness of processes even if the people who approach us are questioning outcomes but would argue that our interventions are also guided by our judgment that an outcome is fair or unfair
also believe that there are instances of unfair outcomes and unfair processes in which we might want act as advocates
believe both are worthy of ombudsman attention
let us begin with unfair out comes because it presents the greatest challenge to our perception of ombudsman neutrality
con sider circumstance which believe is fairly common in the work of most ombudsmen certainly they have been common in my experience someone comes to us when they want an exception to rule because the application of the rule will create hardship for them due to some highly individualized circumstances
the person is not looking to challenge the rule in fact the person may even acknowledge the reasonableness of the rule but still believe that the consequences of applying the rule in their situation are unreasonable or unfair
having directly but unsuccessfully appealed to the office that applies that rule they come to the ombudsman for help in obtaining that exception
it is my belief that in such situation it is appropriate and even valuable to an organization for an ombudsman to become an advocate for that person in that circum stance
bureaucracies are not noted for their great flexibility and believe one important function of an ombudsman can be to help expand an ability to adapt to individual needs when circum stances warrant
when in the judgment exercising discretion of the ombudsman not allowing an exception to the rule will lead to an unnecessarily unfair outcome
let me give case example drawn from my own work experience where advocated for someone
first year graduate student came to see me because she was very upset about her student id number
student id numbers were randomly assigned and because so many people have lucky numbers unlucky num be rs and range of other numerical preferences the university had very firm rule that students had to keep the number they were assigned
clearly this is process unbiased and applied evenhandedly
the student who came to me understood the rule but she was member of an apocalyptic church in which the number was the sign of the devil
having that number in her student id caused her considerable anxiety and she was unable to get past that anxiety and concentrate on her work
with my intervention the office that oversaw the assignment of numbers and related matters made an exception and gave her different student id number
suppose one could say that was arguing for fair ness not arguing for this student but in actuality making general argument that that there ought to be exceptions to the rule about student id numbers nor was suggesting that the university rethink its process for assigning student ids
was arguing that there ought to be an exception for this student who was negatively affected by the rule and suffering undue hardship
in many circumstances unfairness comes to our attention in the form of par ticul ar person group who has been treated unfairly whatever principles might underlie our intervention journal of the international ombudsman association howard gad lin when we attempt to bring wrong to the attention of those who can correct it we are directly or indirectly advocating for the person group who has been wronged
mind you am not saying that in every instance where person feels wronged we become their advocate or even that in every instance where we agree the person has been wronged we should become their advocate
certainly an instance of organizational wrongdoing can lead us to address the policy procedure or practice that led or contributed to the wrongdoing without advocating for different outcome for the person who brought the matter to our attention
here is an example of an unfair process where an in dividual instance led me to advocate for modifying rule while in no way advocating for the individual
at tenured and tenure track scientists are reviewed every four years by committee of outside scientists
the guidelines for those reviews stipulate that the members of the review committee should not com munic ate directly with the scientist they are reviewing but rather should communicate through the scientific director like dean of the institute where the sci en ti st works
for years this has been widely understood to mean that it is also improper for the scientist being reviewed to directly communicate with the scientists who are conducting the review
however one sci en ti st who was under review initiated many comm uni ca ti ons with his review committee much to the dismay of his scientific director and many of his colleagues
in this instance the focus of my intervention was to bring the flaw in the written procedure to the at ten ti on of the appropriate scientific administrators of the review process and to suggest that they rewrite it to remove ambiguity in the written policy
did not even have to make any reference to the individual case that led to my recommendation
however the commit ment to fairness was among the factors that led to my engagement in this issue if an evaluative pro ce dure is ambiguously worded such that it allows some individuals to obtain different treatment than others that procedure opens up the possibility of unfairness as well as the potential for conflict
although for the purposes of this discussion have drawn distinction between unfair process and unfair outcome the difficulty in separating process from outcome becomes clear when we turn our attention to the complexities of addressing procedural fairness fair and equitably administered processes in an or ga ni zati on al context
nick die hl deputy ombudsman at the american red cross and prepared handout years ago drawing heavily on the work of tom tyler in which we listed four major dimensions to procedural justice term
the fairness of an formal decision making rules
the quality of treatment people receive under those rules
the fairness of decision making by each supervisor
the quality of their treatment by that supervisor
work has suggested four criteria for assessing procedural justice
consistency like cases should be treated alike
unbiased those implementing procedures must be impartial and neutral
participation those affected by decisions should have voice and representation in the process both in providing information and appealing decision
transparency processes should be transparent procedures should be open without secrecy or deception including the criteria on which sion is based
notice that this framework is relatively easy to apply when we are discussing formal procedures processes evaluation methods and decision making
one can see how an organization might assess procedural fair journal of the international ombudsman association howard gad lin ness and also how an ombudsman might confidently evaluate whether or not the criteria of procedural justice have been met
sometimes on the basis of an individual case we can identify flaw in an org ani za ti on al procedure as in the example of scientists under review cited above
as ombudsmen we have to be alert to procedures or processes that regularly create unfair outcomes or violate some fundamental rights or values of the organizational members using or subjected to that procedure
for many of the issues or matters that come to our attention however there are not and cannot be formal rules procedures or processes
in educational settings and work places many tension points and conflicts arise within the context of relationships and work related interactions
in these situations assess ing fairness is extremely complex and highly subj ec complex because it is confounded with other factors and subjective because there may not be com mon standards against which to assess actions
there is no single correct way to be department chair or lab chief or teaching fellow
what is the boundary between power abuse and leadership style
when is criticism delivered in an unfair way
when is it unfair not to provide critical feedback
we could list dozens of similar questions
but would argue that when we as ombudsmen work with these sorts of issues we regularly assess and evaluate both the situations and the people involved and make judgments about them and some of those judgments are about fair ness so that our subsequent dealings with the people or the issues are shaped in part by those judgments
am not saying this is the only dimension along which we evaluate and assess just that it is one of the major dimensions along which we respond
in note to me after reading an early draft of this paper tom ombudsman at the university of colorado boulder one of the most thoughtful people in our profession said be honest our sop on vocat ing for fair process frankly seems pretty un re lated to most of my work
every issue people bring to us clearly involved conflict but many fewer seem to involve or in any obvious way
for example when colleagues fight there are often hurt feelings bad communication lack of trust andor respect
often one dislikes what the other has said or done or has strong values difference with her or him
but in these is not much of an obvious issue
not sure completely agree because think hurt feelings and loss of trust are almost always connected to issues of fairness but the important point is that in many cases issues of fairness are embedded in and confounded by other dimensions of situation
we all know that in conflict matters of fairness take on special significance and the successful resolution of conflict depends on establishing fair conditions for working out the conflict
for these same reasons process and outcome are not easily separated and we can only advocate for fairness by taking into account the complex multidimensional nature of the conflict
let me give another case example one not at all built around advocating for person
let me frame it around another aspect of the ombudsman role in for
but here want to speak about an aspect of the informality of the ombudsman function that think is not well represented in our standards of practice
one of the most important features of the ombudsman is that she is able to address issues for which there are no formal polices laws rules procedures guide lines or processes
in any organization whether it is governmental agency university or corporation innumerable opportunities for wrong doing unfair ness injustice mistreatment and conflict present themselves
the ombudsman is an important part of an organization precisely because she is someone to whom members of the organization can come with issues that are not covered by any aspect of the or ga governance mechanisms
in the case discuss here some specific details have been altered for reasons of confidentiality but the essential dynamic remains the same was visited by tenured faculty member who had attempted to rescind her resignation from the university and had been refused by the department chair
her re signa ti on had been submitted many months earlier when she was told she was suffering from progressive medical condition that would severely impair her ab il to continue her academic career
at the time she was the most successful academic in the department journal of the international ombudsman association howard gad linin terms of publications and scholarly reputation and one of the better teachers
however she was not well liked by her colleagues in part because she thought the department could improve its reputation both in scholarship and in teaching
when she learned of her medical condition she approached the department chair with whom she had soso relationship and explained her circumstances
the department chair responded sympathetically but also made request of the faculty member
like her he was interested in improving the reputation so he asked her to formulate her letter of resignation as an expression of her dissatisfaction with the current state of the department rather than as response to her personal medical condition
that would allow him to use her resignation to argue for increasing the resources so they could improve their reputation and keep from losing other valuable faculty members
dedicated academic that she was she agreed to this plan and wrote her re sig nation letter accordingly
she then went ahead with the resignation and over the next several months filed all the appropriate forms
the department meanwhile was given money to replace her and to bring in ad dition al faculty
just when the department was advertising its new positions and before the faculty intended retirement date she learned that her progressive medical condition was in fact caused by reaction to medication she was receiving for an entirely dif fere nt medical problem
if she stopped taking that medication the progressive medical condition would reverse itself over time
as one can imagine she was overjoyed and went to tell the good news to the department chair and to ask for him to reinstate her faculty position
the chair although agreeing that it was good news that her medical condition could be reversed was not open to reinstating her faculty po si ti on
he was excited about the possibilities for recruit ing new faculty and the wheels were already turning for her retirement the date for rescinding the retire ment request had passed although did learn that it might be possible to stop the process
at that point she came to my office
this was one of those instances where we hear story and our initial re ac ti on even when we know there is at least one side to the story said to myself is even before could fully articulate why had that reaction
now of course did all the things that ombudsmen do in situation like this listened to her story reviewed the relevant rules and procedures and discussed full range of options by which she might pursue her case
at her request spoke with and then facilitated con versation between her and the department chair
the chair confirmed all the essential features of her story they did not disagree about what had happened
however they were not able to come to an agree ment the chair just did not want to have her back in the department
she then appealed to the dean who sided with the department chair even though he heard the full story of the circumstances under which she had resigned and about the resolution of her medical problems
the dean was strong supporter of the department chair and was also enthusiastic about the direction in which the chair was moving the department
at her request also facilitated con ver sation between her and the dean but the result was the same as the conversation with the department chair
keep in mind there was no formal procedure or rule to address this sort of circumstance
in fact the resignation and request for additional faculty had all been done properly according to university policies and procedures
the appeals she made were not formal they did not make reference to rules broken or procedures violated
the appeal was personal it was grounded in the narrative she told
her last hope was the provost who was quite new to the campus and to the position
when she asked to bring the matter to him he expressed reluctance to interfere in the af fairs of department especially so early in his tenure and when the dean had already reached decision
at that point and telling both the dean and the depart ment chair in advance what intended to do went to see the provost and asked him to meet with the fa cul member and hear her story
now suppose could claim that was not advocating for her rather for fair process but think that would be misrepresentation of what did
believe to this day that did the right thing
it is true that did ask the provost to hear her story but in making the case for him to meet with her had to make clear that thought she had not been treated fairly even though no rules had been broken
am certain communicated that believed an injustice would be done if he did not at least review the si tua ti on even though never said explicitly said so
there was no way could make this case without indicating journal of the international ombudsman association howard gad lin to the provost that believed the dean and the de part ment chair had made an decision
let me be clear did not say was wrong or should rule in her favor but everything in my demeanor and in the way pressed the issue not to mention the way told the story must have made clear that thought there was an injustice that should be addressed
looking back on my conversations with the depart ment chair and then with the dean did not take her side acted like mediator
however before the conversation in making the case for each of them to participate in the facilitated conversation must have communicated that there was good reason to do so
and the good reason even if never said this using these words was that believed that they want to reconsider their decision and that they want to try looking at this situation in different than when they made that decision
although can no longer remember my specific words bet that if you had overheard me speaking to the dean or to the department head you would have heard more than would like chance to meet with you again regarding your decision about rescinding her resignation
tom wrote me after reading this he wrote
and what think would greatly strengthen it is an explanation about how you decided what was
it may be incredibly simple but what criteria did you use
believe it would help lot to articulate these
that led to conclusions that what was occurring was or unjust
of course he was exactly right
first had to acknowledge to myself that did not and do not have fully worked out set of criteria whereby made judgments about whether an outcome was fair or not
for process fairness tom work provides dimensions and criteria for assessing fairness especially for formal procedures and decision making processes
but for the complex conflicts and situations like the one with the faculty remember above if am honest have to admit that cannot specify what the criteria were although do re call how clearly felt that this was
both process and outcome factors contributed to that judgment
after years of practice my intuitive response realize should indeed be framed through donald scho en like reflective practice discussion that helps us make implicit knowledge explicit
tom is asking an incredibly important question and he points us toward some work we need to do
begin an expanded discussion about criteria for outcome and procedural fairness told bob shel ton former ombudsman at the university of kansas has discussion of fairness elsewhere in this volume but deliberately kept myself from ask ing to see his paper
begin developing best practices and persuasive strategies tom again for advocating for fairness
even those who disagree about advocating for people can consider approaches to advocate for fair process
support or initiate research that examines what ombudsmen actually do rather than what they say they do
develop approaches by which ombudsmen can raise or address issues of fairness even when the people who bring their situations to us are re luc ta nt or afraid to do so
this is fairly tame conclusion given that my ar gu ment challenges parts of one of our most cherished standards
do this because believe that our stan dar ds as currently written do not provide full support for the organizational ombudsman to serve as an advocate for fairness and justice in the organizations within which we serve
andre mar in the legendary ombudsman for the province of ontario occasionally calls out his colleagues for being the of the institutions within their jurisdiction
that is harsh accusation but believe it is hazard of working as an organizational ombudsman and danger of which we need to be aware
think it is time to revisit our standards of practice and to assess whether or not they adequately support the essential qualities of the ombudsman role
how can you know if being fair to every one
personally quite sure that in the course of years of mediation arbitration and other cases have been unfair to at least some of the parties
but with rare exceptions in which later reflection con me that had made the wrong decision in case that required decision know which ones
as this suggests should offer caveat up front am not nor have ever been an ombudsman
also have never had the opportunity to study ombudsmen formally
have been mediator and arbitrator how ever and have held several other roles to an aggregate total somewhere over cases involving many kinds of organizations and have known few ombudsmen
the strongest impression have of their practices is that they vary greatly though so that in itself help much
for purposes of this discus sion going to address primarily the aspects of an work that are closest to mediation because mediation at least anecdotally seems to me very important element of the job and one that have studied
more than many mediators or quasi mediators of course ombudsmen operate within institutional settings
and in many institutional settings there is an existing and basic device for assessing fairness the individual complaint or rather pattern of them
second common device is standardized survey which parties are asked to fill out at the conclusion of the case
but the surveys have seen almost never break down the questions presented in such way as to pinpoint exactly what mediator or ombudsman did particularly well or particularly badly among an inevitably complex matrix of skills and approaches any of which could have fairness implications
and even if someone complains does that necessarily mean you were unfair in that particular case
fairness and self evaluation christopher honey man journal of the international ombudsman association christopher honey man for example many years ago managed to offend both parties in relatively large labor mediation case to the level that they jointly went to the state agency which had appointed me and demanded replace ment
the three commissioners for whom worked invited them in for meeting to explain their com plaints
the parties relatively big organizations both described me as essentially failing to show ate respect for their weight and station one form perhaps of unfairness
the commissioners asked some questions and retired to discuss the matter
but when they returned the commissioners informed the parties that in their joint view the parties deserved me as mediator
after the parties left though the commissioners trenchantly informed me that was never again to put them in that situation on pain of great personal suf fer ing which they would arrange
the relevance of such story here is that strongly suspect that despite the difference in circumstances have great deal of company among om buds men in one respect was totally unaware until informed that formal complaint had been lodged that the parties had any particular beef with me at all as distinguished from the customary
but think just me for variety of reasons reliable feedback loop has simply been missing from much if not all of our field
can imagine many circumstances in which the parties dealing with an ombudsman or any other variety of mediator or quasi mediator who has ties to might be dissatisfied and yet think twice or three times before registering any overt complaint
the converse is to be praised when you de serve it
in cases where minimally conscientious endeavor had revealed that the parties were much closer than they thought they were so that no great effort or talent was necessary to bring them to agree ment the parties might well remain unaware of that happy circumstance
cases of this kind in busy labor mediation practice were seen often enough that they had generic classification in the shop talk they were known as cases
no give the provenance it was already in use when arrived in the late and its origins are now shrouded
it seems likely that an ombudsman would find ac cu rate and forthright evaluation by parties even harder to obtain than did when set out to analyze what made some mediators better than most
after all an ombudsman is not only directly employed by the very organization within which the dispute takes place but typically at level and in role which implies some degree of power
am prepared to argue that for you to act fairly you must apply an appro pria te balance of skill and effort among definable criteria
if either your skills or your efforts are not in balance one party the party whose point of view is most dependent for its effective explication on whichever particular element of skill or effort has come up short is liable to be disadvantaged
one of the reasons fairness is so hard to nail down is that it seems to be composite product of whole range of actions and attitudes all of which are difficult and all of which seem to have both situational and cultural components
thus mediator or ombudsman might act unfairly in one given situation by not trying hard enough to be empathetic
second in different situation might act unfairly by pressing for closure on basis that seemed to be obvious while another under still other circumstances might be unfair by not trying hard enough to invent workable solution at least when the parties seemed incapable of doing so for themselves
if you accept these premises it becomes possible to use some experience in assessing mediators closely related occupation to at least begin out lin ing in context sensitive way what the skills that you must balance might be
with that in hand you are equipped to get handle on how to assess yourself as to whether you are balancing them fairly
it might even be possible to create system that would en courage people who have dealings with you to come forth and be heard in way that would preserve their comfort and their sense of privacy
carried out in various branches of the field and with significant academic and user group input experiments with performance based assessment of mediators have by now resulted in number of statements which characterize different aspects of performance in at least some settings
one journal of the international ombudsman association christopher honey man sample set of such criteria is listed in the appendix to this article three others can be found in honey man et al
each element among them however is malleable not one of these skill definitions was ever intended to be taken universally because they inevitably contain value laden judgments of what the word means which must be adjusted to fit the goals and proper expectations of widely varying programs not to mention different cultures
there are many variants in use
one common factor however is that with properly constructed scales no one has ever been found to the full range
one of the best mediators in the us upon first seeing the initial set remarked to me that he thought that on good day he could hit the top note on two or three of them
as it must be if sufficient room is to be allowed for different approaches
yet demanding statement of these criteria remains in my view the best starting point available for ad ap tat ion
following study of group of media tors performed in the mids see honey man developed the initial set of such evaluation scales for an oral performance based examination of prospective labor mediators using actors to play the parties
subsequently using cases and evaluation criteria drawn from the variously appropriate settings the basic idea has been found adaptable to internal agency functions intracompany disputes among in dividual employees and managers and wide variety of court based mediation programs among others
the evaluation scales have been reformulated for different cultures and languages
they have also been adapted to certification needs evaluation by super vi so rs self evaluation and training as well as by parties
so the set shown in the app en dix which is one of the more subtle ones extant and postdates by about years the initial version of such evaluation scales is the beneficiary of good deal of experience
among all the uses of such scales meanwhile one seems particularly relevant here
after had been working with this general scheme for few years one of the more famous mediators in the us remarked to me that he had found his own use for the first set of evaluation scales
he said that he had written down the key points on an index card which he kept in his wallet and every time he felt that his case of the day was not going well he would go out in the hall by himself pull out the card and ask himself which of these skills had he not been exercising
believe any ombudsman could rewrite the scales as appropriate to her or his particular institutional man date and then do essentially the same thing
further more in my experience the mere act of redefining the skill definitions for new setting can prompt bout of real soul searching as to what the key men ts of in that setting including fairness ought to be
in other words believe this exercise alone would help an ombudsman sharpen her perception of fairness or its absence in parts of her work which over hundreds of cases may have become somewhat routine
how can an ombudsman respond to perceived deficiency in one or more of these skills
what about the improbability of perfect separation between standard of practice demand of advocacy for administered and its demand to avoid advocacy behalf of any
after all addressing an existing inequity by definition advances interests which have been suppressed in the past
what about selection bias among those who bother to fill out questionnaire
will the opinions of the resulting anonymous and perhaps highly selected group actually help an ombudsman improve practice
what other methods might there be to figure out how well given ombudsman is doing
and does think ing about evaluation actually help an ombudsman understand fairness
but it seems to me that many people in many walks of life overcome whatever deficiencies of skill they have by conscious and focused application of extra effort perhaps including skill specific additional training
hence the focus advocate on thinking about balance of effort and skill among host of difficult to achieve men ts such as those listed in the appendix
for what worth while have no research basis for this belief on practical level known one particular quite stable population of mediators and parties quite well over many years
the mediators in that group are generally considered quite fair by the parties they work with
still they are seen working at the skills that individually come natural to them
journal of the international ombudsman association christopher honey man similarly the tension between the two kinds of advocacy is likely to be most fairly addressed by an ombudsman who is self aware both of the risks and of any propensity she may have toward attacking prob le ms with one tool rather than another
have often found even talented mediators lacking in such self awareness
there is also careful research to the same effect
and while would be delighted to see other writers in this issue presenting dependable alternative ways to figure out how doing am personally unable to offer any alternatives that believe to be at all reliable
also believe however that it might be possible for ombudsmen collectively to do something more than one ombudsman can do by herself which would perhaps help enlarge the reporting group to some thing reasonably representative
it would also provide good opportunity for some ombudsmen to grapple as group with reformulating the set of evaluation criteria which experience elsewhere gests would be even more rewarding than the solo effort advocated above
to my knowledge nothing like what will propose has previously been attempted on large scale by any other kind of mediation community so offer it in all humility
because of the interest in this subject by the international ombudsman association however there is effectively an institutional player which by taking an active role might solve the problem of maintaining confidentiality of parties who might well wish to register an opinion but might fear re pe rc us si ons
with these caveats suppose low cost service were to be organized by or in conjunction with with an anonymous form that parties to dispute could be invited to fill out online few days after the om buds work was over
the form could include some version of the evaluation scales above though for best response rate it might be necessary to com promise on the level of detail and for convenience it might be necessary to compromise on the level of local tailoring so that the same form could be used for multiple institutions
parties could be told by each participating ombudsman that the purpose of the questionnaire is purely for self improvement by ombudsmen in general and that no one but the ombudsman in question would ever see the answers
but the most important element would be an explicit undertaking built into the programming that the answers for any particular ombudsman would be aggregated over some appropriate period of time perhaps year perhaps more or less so that no individual questionnaire could be picked out
technologically this is play compared to much of what is now on the web
it seems possible there fore that such structure could be created at very low cost perhaps with single startup grant and with then housing what in terms would be relatively simple web site
the result might well be the ability to flag to given ombudsman privately an area in which otherwise strong performance seemed in need of help or further study in the view of significant number of respondents
of all the fields within or close to mediation it seems to me ombudsmen are among those best fitted for this kind of approach for one thing they tend to have large caseloads compared to most mediators making it likely that even with something less than response rate individual identities would truly be protected
for the same reason the aggregate responses would likely reflect enough of pattern that anomalous cases and outlier opinions would not distort the picture very much
and finally the om buds practitioners have known who admittedly may or may not be representative have been rather more intellectual and rather more intellectually principled group than some otherwise excellent mediators have known in other contexts
that suggests that within this community there might be the will to take such venture seriously and make it happen
and finally in response to the question think ing about evaluation help us to understand fairness
have straight answer if as seems probable con fi den ti ality and expense preclude bringing in specially trained observers how else do you propose to un der stand whether you are being fair to actual human beings if not by some combination of querying them and in fashion that more seriously attempts to encourage them to answer thoughtfully than the so called routinely distributed by media ti on programs and querying yourself

introduction some experts believe that unresolved conflict represents the largest reducible cost in many bu si nesses yet the financial human and credibility costs of conflict in the workplace are not measured in most organizations nor pro actively managed
this article discusses the link between conflict man age ment and conflict cost control presents an an aly sis of costs of badly managed conflict and proposes tools to illustrate and measure such costs
case study conducted in the united nations high com missioner for refugees provides additional empirical quantitative and qualitative conflict data to illustrate such costs in an international organization
positive and negative conflict this article discusses negative implications of unmanaged or badly managed conflict that is those elements which impact negatively on human relations and the efficiency of an organization
this distinction is important as conflict is reality of our daily lives and conflict is thus inevitable in human workplace
disagreement occurs even in the best working relationship and chal leng ing ideas can strengthen an outcome
though the claim that well managed conflict automatically results in efficiency gains is challenged by some it is generally accepted that the right kind of friction and constructive confr on ta ti on and arguments over ideas in an atmosphere of mutual respect can help any organization and has the potential to drive greater performance and creativity and help produce major innovations
the question how well conflict is managed and how conflict is addressed can either add to or take away from an or bottom line
conflict cost study journal of the international ombudsman association helm ut buss published in distinguishes between functional and dysfunctional conflict costs
functional costs are conflict costs which benefit an org ani za ti on and dysfunctional costs refer to detrimental and avoidable conflict costs
well managed conflict in an enabling environment allows for issues to be tabled and discussed with objective language
each party is empowered to state his or her position with confidence that the other party is genuinely listening wanting to understand
possible solutions are explored with open minds
in badly managed conflict personal attacks are com mon
people can get visibly angry and feelings get hurt
words can become weapons that leave nasty scars
no management without measurement effective conflict management requires mea surement to determine its impact on an be it in terms of its financial situation the wellbeing of its workforce or its reputation
with out measurement conflict management risks being limited to addressing individual cases of workplace conflict without identifying the underlying causes or providing data which would allow for systemic and verifiable analysis of changes in the conflict management culture
as management guru peter dr uc ker you measure it you manage
many employers have introduced policies and tools over the past years to hold employees more account able for their behavior at work
such tools include zero tolerance policies for wrongdoing in areas such as workplace harassment or fraud protection against retaliation for whistle blowers and codes of ethics with accompanying sensitization and learning programs
tools have been introduced to assist the workforce in dealing with workplace conflict management such as the ombudsman office or mediators
it remains un clear however whether such policies and structures have helped in effectively addressing some of the underlying causes of conflict let alone in strengthen ing organizational conflict management culture
it is striking to note that while significant efforts have been made over recent years to increase the level of accountability for personal behavior and to increase efficiencies through various forms of cost reduction the cost of conflict in the workplace is in most or ga ni zati ons not considered variable worth measuring nor is it pro actively managed
many leaders brush off incidents of low morale and unhealthy conflict as the unavoidable result of
the problem is compounded in not for profit organizations which build on their motivation for good
the same applies to international bodies such as the united nations
is it the discomfort fear and negative associations surrounding conflict that keep organizations from addressing costs of conflict at work
or are the costs just not visible enough to gain the attention they deserve
some experts believe that unresolved conflict rep re sents the largest reducible cost in many businesses yet it remains largely unrecognized
sla ik eu and has son consider that conflict management represents the opportunity for cost control for or ga ni zati ons in the next
the question arises of how to alert organizational leaders to these apparent untapped opportunities for achieving better efficiency
this can be done by addressing conflict management as business case
addressing conflict in the workplace through in te grated conflict cost management systems should be viewed as sine qua non in achieving organizational effectiveness and enhancing productivity
recognizing the costs and underlying cost drivers will motivate change
if the underlying dynamics of badly managed conflict are understood and their related high financial and human costs established in mea sur able way through qualitative and quantitative data as opposed to anecdotes organizations will be able to develop tools which will allow them clarify which data to collect and to measure
measure the efficiency of its conflict management efforts
detect and address in timely manner actual or potential costs of badly managed conflict
journal of the international ombudsman association helm ut buss iii
three conflict cost categories as stated above unresolved conflict can create serious and quite varied consequences involving high financial and human costs
all conflict costs can be allocated to one or more of the following three cat ego ries organization employees and clients
costs to the organization by way of example study conducted by the based centre for effective dispute resolution ce dr reveals that percent of disputes have significant impact on the smooth running of bu si ness
productivity productivity suffers when unhealthy conflict persists
research findings show that as much as to percent of time is spent simply dealing with employees in conflict
those percentages are possibly inflated when compared to survey con ducted with employees in various countries in europe and the americas by opp an international business psychology consultancy jointly with the chartered institute of personnel and develop ment
the survey found that employees spend depending on the country in which the survey was conducted between hours and hours week dealing with badly managed conflict amounting to respectively percent and percent of the weekly working hours
the survey conducted by the author in found that employees spend hours week in badly managed conflict
for that means potential annual efficiency losses of some million us dollars
these findings are not restricted to
similar survey conducted by the world food programme resulted in comparable find in gs
time spent in dealing with badly managed con is time not valued and which does not contribute to achieving operational targets
productivity also suffers when company redesigns work flow only to avoid people having to interact with one another
the resulting changed procedures or structures are rarely more efficient
absenteeism and presentee ism in the context of this analysis is cost which stands for the number of unscheduled per son al days taken off work by individuals affected by badly managed conflict
research has shown that high correlation exists between absenteeism stress and needing break from fighting with coworkers
studies have shown that health care expenditures are nearly percent higher for workers who report high levels of stress
while differences in individual characteristics such as personality or coping style need to be taken into account there are working conditions that are stressful to most people work environment characterized by unresolved conflict being one of those conditions
it appears however that few organizations engage in proactive health productivity management to allow for early detection of workplace related health problems
among the reasons for such lack of attention are silo mentality in managing health care of staff the lack of insight into the link between workplace conflict and health problems or the absence of integrated data on staff health problems
while absenteeism is the failure to report to work consists of showing up at work while ill or otherwise not completely fit for work and the productivity decline that can result from this con di ti on
the term also refers to employees who on the or people who have simply given up
they do not do the work expected from them and as result cause additional workload for others in their area
it is only recently that research in occupational medicine has begun to suggest that work lost due to absentee ism is only the visible tip of an iceberg and that the hidden cost of presentee ism may be much greater
turnover researchers studying exit interview data on voluntary departures state that chronic unresolved conflict is decisive factor in at least percent of all such de par tur es
work life conflict study conducted in canada found that it costs about percent of one trained salary to replace him or her
conflict ac counts for up to percent of involuntary departures with the possible exception of staff reductions due to downsizing and restructuring
in the united na ti ons however unresolved conflict seems to have less relevance in voluntary departure decisions
journal of the international ombudsman association helm ut buss
reputation badly managed conflict can seriously tarnish the reputation of organizations and companies
lower motivation productivity and service levels impact on competitiveness
frustrated and poorly treated employees generally tell people inside and outside the organization and spread the word often in ten ti on ally
research has shown that nearly percent of an employees who are impacted by negative conflict tell other people inside and outside the organization
today social networks increase the risk of employees venting their anger
reputation af fec ts an ability to retain top talent and to secure stakeholder support including from clients and shareholders or in the case of many not for profit organizations donor support
other costs the amount of theft and damage in company has direct correlation to the level of employee conflict
an internal analysis of costs of unresolved cases of ha ra ss ment in the united nations identified the follow ing three quantifiable counts full pay for victims while absent on sick leave salary of employees assigned as replacement salary of colleagues providing support or counsel to victims during working time
costs to the employee as we have seen above unmanaged or badly man aged conflict is stressful reduces confidence levels and produces anxieties and frustration
it leads to lowered job motivation humiliation and stress induced psychological and physical illness with of ten dramatic consequences for the employee family and friends and long term career hopes
people involved in conflict experience break in their interpersonal connections and often feel alienated from each other and self focused
they may avoid or attack each other in number of different ways with drawing from each other interrupting not listening or finding unnecessary fault with each other
this is detrimental not only to the working relationship but also to those with whom they work as energy is used in fuelling the conflict rather than in furthering the performance of the individuals or the team
ag gravat ing conflict leads parties to avoid contact relations are limited to the minimum communication is not open information withheld or wrong information provided
is impacting negatively on employees in that it might worsen existing medical conditions damage the quality of working life and give im pres si ons of ineffectiveness at work
in the survey two thirds of the respondents agree with the statement that badly managed conflict affects their efficiency at work and their personal wellbeing
staggering eight in ten respondents feel stressed
almost seven in ten respondents state that they suffer from burnout as result of conflict
over half of the respondents feel that conflict changes their mood makes them less friendly and balanced
the survey data confirms the findings from other research identifying close relation between workplace con emotional exhaustion and stress and potential for resulting absenteeism and employee turnover
costs to the client clients are rarely referred to in the literature desc rib ing cost implications of workplace conflict
this is surprising as the implications of workplace conflict on the quality of products or services seems to be evident
particularly in highly competitive industries the negative implications on client satisfaction and reputation can be substantial and become question of survival
most of these costs are hidden and difficult to qualify
however there can be very visible consequences in cases of reduced motivation of staff leading to lower quality products or services or mistakes that can even threaten lives be it due to faulty products or lower quality service in life and death situations
by way of example refugees risk suffering or even dying if humanitarian workers can not function properly and are unable to provide the required assistance in timely manner due to un re solved workplace conflict
journal of the international ombudsman association helm ut buss iv
cost visibility measurability linking conflict cost visibility and measurability can help organizations to start gathering easily visible and measurable costs of conflict
cost visibility visibility is defined in this analysis as how easily ne ga consequences can be spotted or recognized as result of conflict in the workplace
the most visible negative consequences of conflict include easily no tice able costs such as legal fees and increased health costs
as explained above for many people the experience of badly managed conflict is alienating and dis em powering
they feel themselves to be and experience downward spiral into negative thinking and feeling
physically people become ill suffering from range of stress related illnesses
resulting visible consequences include absenteeism reduced motivation increase of wasted time in dealing with unmanaged or badly managed conflict and the de parture of employees
there are other less visible consequences which tend to be the cumulative result of unmanaged conflict in the workplace such as sabotage damage to the brand the diminished ability of com pa ny with questionable reputation for treating its employees fairly to attract top talent the drain of the intellectual capital as result of turnover missed opportunities and the loss of key business with damaging and long term adverse impact on the productivity
many of these costs are cal ly overlooked because they are not immediately associated with conflict and are accounted for as part of the normal cost of doing business
cost measurability while there exist well developed analytical tools to monitor and analyze income ex pen dit ure and other financial data most organizations lack systems monitoring cost of conflict
most conflict theory literature only states that unresolved conflict leads to very high costs without providing methods to measure those costs
at the same time there is an increasing amount of research based on empirical data from surveys among different groups of employees in different industries which attempt to quantify cost of conflict
what is really needed is tool which assists org ani za ti ons to start measuring easily visible costs of conflict
matrix the conflict visibility and measurability matrix below provides an easy overview of some of the more im port ant negative consequences of conflict developed figure
conflict visibility and measurability absenteeism departure of sickness compensation legal aggressive harassment loss of productivity waste of difficult to attract avoidance loss of unpleasant work environment easy difficult measurability easy difficult visibility conflict branding loss of loss of missed opportunities easy difficult journal of the international ombudsman association helm ut buss above while relating them also to the measurability of cost implications building on the research data presented
that easy visibility of negative consequences of conflict cannot automatically be equated to easy measurability of the resulting costs eg loss of motivation and
that some of the more negative consequences of conflict are easily measurable eg accidents at work
the matrix provides flexible tool which should allow any organization to develop its organization specific conflict visibility and measurability scenario which might include another set of consequences of ne ga conflict and thus look different from the set of consequences presented in figure
tools for measuring cost sa number of online sites offer tools to assist in measuring costs
dana has developed formula for organizations to calculate the soft financial costs of conflict
formula builds on data such as the number of individuals involved in particular conflict average number of hours per week each individual spends involved in unproductive participation in con including time distracted from productive work by thinking about or worrying about conflict average annual salary of the employee involved in the conflict and duration of the conflict in weeks per year
without assessing the use and precision of such assessment tools they require information which is rarely readily available as companies are seldom tracking this kind of data
furthermore they require the existence of time management systems which are mostly unavailable outside the corporate sector
by way of example most not for profit organizations do not use time sheets
however what is important is to start collecting and analyzing selected set of easily visible and mea sur able data on consequences of unmanaged conflict
those steps will assist the organization to obtain more precise data on conflict related costs and allow taking targeted action to reduce those costs
it also carries the potential of initiating domino effect that will draw organization wide attention to the relevance of conflict cost controlling for the cy and productivity
promotion of the need for conflict cost controlling in organizations requires the close association of finance and budget departments to build ownership and to eventually include related efficiency gains or losses on the balance sheets
in most organizations the debate on conflict management ap pears to be too limited to hr departments or conflict managers such as ombudsmen
building on the above described nature of the costs and their potential relevance for conflict prevention or identification of efficiency gains data which should be systematically collected and analyzed include cost of employment related legal proceedings and judgments against the organization sick leave re cords including analysis to which extent unmanaged conflict has contributed to the sickness or absence from work and related trends in specific sectors of an organization cost of bringing in temporary staff to cover for absentee staff systematic interviews with employees applying for relocation in the or ga ni zati on or leaving the organization to establish to which extent the action could have been the result of unmanaged conflict cost of recruitment and training of staff replacing colleagues who have left the organization as result of badly managed conflict monitoring of theft sabotage fraud cases inc lud ing the monetary value involved and possible linkage with unmanaged conflict and monitoring of productivity in conflict prone work environments eg operations subjected to change such as relocation andor staff reduction periodic surveys on conflict culture sources of conflict and assessment of impact of unmanaged conflict on decision making
while some of the data collection can consist of using archival work measures such as counting the number of reported complaints of workplace harassment or days of absence from work due to conflict situations other data can be collected by surveys such as peri odic global staff surveys using self reporting inc lud ing the impact of conflict on work productivity
for those who still believe that costs of conflict or at least some of them cannot be measured albert einstein can provide some form of conciliation with his concept that everything that counts can be counted and not everything that can be counted
journal of the international ombudsman association helm ut buss conclusion though it is impossible to calculate the exact cost of conflict some of the related costs are mea sur able or can at least be estimated
the exercise of calculating an relevant cost of conflict drivers is not only an instructive way to think about the costs of putting up with badly managed conflict but also basis to measure effectiveness of conflict management and to visualize the added value of con management tools including the ombudsman office
another reason for trying to the in seemingly rational and number driven business world is that no matter how compelling case on cost of conflict might be people from accounting finance and other quantitative backgrounds prefer to make decisions on the basis of financial estimates before accepting conflict cost management as business case

buds man association research agenda research goals and objectives research ethics
introduction the current paper was solicited by the editors with several objectives in mind
we hope to provide an overview of the research process and define some of the basic terms and methods that are common to most research projects
this serves as follow up to the research agenda that first appeared in the second issue of
we also are hopeful that this discussion will increase awareness of the research process and encourage om buds to initiate research designed to answer some of the questions raised in the agenda
this certainly is not comprehensive review of everything there is to know about research
there is little discussion of the literature search project design data analysis and interpretation of findings
we hope that what is presented serves as good starting point for those who have not been active researchers but who might be ready to address the questions raised in the research agenda
the board of directors met in houston in august to consider the draft of the strategic plan
the plan included section on research and scholarly activity which highlighted two goals be the leading clearinghouse for re search and scholarly activity in the ombudsman field and be recognized as the foremost subject mat ter experts and leading source of knowledge on the ombudsman profession
these aspirations led to the request for an research agenda would ben ef it and its members and advance the profession
the research agenda was approved by the board in the spring of
understanding the research process guide for conducting om buds research alan jay lincoln journal of the international ombudsman association alan jay lincoln
information research about the om buds where did we come from academically professionally
what attracts people to the profession
what can we learn about our personalities values interests and personal work habits
how do we differ from other professionals
how and why do we leave the profession
information research about the om buds how are we perceived
how are we trained and socialized
what are the possible effects of certification
what challenges do we face as profession
information research about om buds what tools and skills do we use to assist constituents
how do we apply and the coe in practice
how do we define and measure effectiveness
what value do our practices bring to our organizations
what is our impact on others
have you ever wondered how or why your colleagues became om buds
are you curious about other work loads salaries stress levels or office support
have you wanted to know about the short and long term outcomes for the visitors involved in particularly intense and difficult case
do you think you may have spotted pattern to the abusive or hostile em ails and communications coming from many different bullying workers
have you considered making small change in your procedures and strategies but are unsure of the possible impact on your
are you curious about or mandated to demonstrate how your services are perceived and evaluated
these are reasonable interesting and useful questions that have something in common
each one can be studied or investigated using one or more scientific research strategies
being inquisitive is valuable and probably natural human quality
while inquiry is continuous natural and useful not all inquiry is scientific
we might seek answers to some pressing questions by drawing upon our own experiences or seeking answers from those with some perceived ex pert ise
our own experiences and casual observations about om buds training may be limited or atypical and our memories may be faulty
information gathered from perceived experts is fine as long as our per cep ti ons about or their claims to expertise are legitimate
scientific research approach or research method ology can help us avoid making many of the com mon mistakes of more casual inquiry including over generalizing and drawing premature conclusions
understanding the research process not only helps guide our own research efforts it also makes it easier to understand interpret and apply other relevant research studies
as we continue our discussion there will be an opp or to become more familiar with the components of the research process
we will highlight some of the research strategies most relevant to the kinds of re search that om buds might carry out some strengths and weaknesses of these methods and strategies and examples of existing research and potential research projects from the research agenda that focus on our om buds colleagues the om buds profession and om buds practices
journal of the international ombudsman association alan jay lincoln the building blocks research questions concepts operational definitions and variables
research questions the research question or questions help or ga and focus study into narrow and manage able topic
the questions influence every part of the research project from the literature search and study design to the data collection analysis and inter preta ti on of the findings
the research question helps us focus on do need to find out about by the issue or
our research agenda basically is list of potential research questions
as an additional example study of an organizational om buds office presents the first research question this we pose research question one how successful are om buds processes on conventional measures of success such as number of cases handled decrease in litigation student turnover case disposition and disputant satisfaction
if we are interested in studying the frequency of bullying behavior we might begin by identifying the concepts of interest
is term we use to describe particular way of behaving
it is shortcut to describing all the behaviors that could fall into that category
since different people are likely to have different definitions of bullying behavior we need to define how we are using this concept in our own particular research
do we want to include in threats yelling unwanted physical contacts cu le in front of others the silent treatment and so on
it is up to the researcher to make these choices which might be different in previous or subsequent study
the important point is that what we mean by bullying should be clear to all
all readers will now know how we distinguish bullying from other behaviors
operational definitions once we have identified our concepts of interest we need to specify the observable and measurable conditions or events that guide the mea surement of that concept
typically there are several potential operational definitions for the concepts we are interested in
looking at our research agenda we might use an operational definition of power that looks at the amount of change in specified behaviors of interest such as changes in the number of total em ails sent the number sent to particular person or the number of times an employee was on time
think about the number of ways we might try to operation effectiveness
the operations chosen will have an immediate impact on the research process including the methods used and the results
provided this approach to an operational definition of effectiveness
number of quantitative measures related to effectiveness may be determined inc lud ing the percent of the population aware of the office of those who know what issues may be raised and of those who believe it is an independent neutral and informal means to discuss and resolve matters within the organization
definitions must be valid do they truly measure what we claim they are measuring
opera ti on al definitions must be reliable the results of repeated measures will be the same if nothing has changed
variables when concept has two or more identifiable levels it can be treated as variable
the concept of gender has two obvious levels male and female
membership has four levels member associate af filiate and retired
there are measurable and ob serv able indicators for each of these levels
for example member is defined practicing organizational ombudsman who
adheres to the standards of practice and code of ethics
in instances where the ombudsman has other job functions for the organization fulfillment of those duties must not compromise the independence neutrality confidentiality or informality of the om buds man role and
has no job function which would make him or her an agent of the organization for the purposes of of the international ombudsman association alan jay measure of success included the number of cases change in litigation and student turnover
the levels of several of these variables are fairly obvious
cases and turnover can be tabulated and change in litigation either can be tabulated one in three in two in or perhaps mea sured as percentage increase or decrease
measure ment of case disposition and disputant satisfaction are not as obvious
there are several possible levels of case disposition
satisfaction will be even more difficult to identify and measure
he chose to link this to whether the students claimed that they got all some or none of what was desired
this was measured as part of the interview process
imagine for moment that we want to study the frequency and intensity of bullying that visitor is ex peri enc ing
both intensity and frequency are concepts that vary from time to time and place to place they are variables
we could measure frequency simply by dividing the levels into none or some
we could be more specific by classifying the frequency of bullying into more distinct categories such as less than once week two to five times week six to ten times week and more than ten times week
perhaps another example would be helpful
the friday poll from the om buds bl og asked readers about their own review process when is it done and who does it
notice how they have decided to measure the frequency of evaluations and the identity of the evaluator both are variables
no set every other time period who evaluates
the general purpose of research is to find useful answers to our questions while using one or more of the appropriate scientific procedures or methods
when we choose to use scientific approach to col lect ing data or finding answers we do so hoping that the data or information collected will be relevant unbiased and reliable
our new information should be relevant so that it relates to the actual question or questions being asked
it should be reliable which implies that if the information were collected again it would be the same if there were no changes in the situation
scale is reliable when it provides identical measures when the same unchanged object is weighed again
using scientific research strategies also helps us avoid intentional and unintentional biases in the in forma ti on we collect
if we wanted to find out about the range in the number of years of professional ex peri en ce of fellow om buds we should not ask only those om buds we know personally or who happen to be at the same conference session
these particular groups of om buds might not provide us the best representative portrait
perhaps younger om buds are over or under represented at conference
if so the data likely would be unintentionally biased
proper research strategies will also minimize any unfortunate tendency to intentionally bias the results by collecting data that is certain to support particular opinion or viewpoint
imagine that someone is hoping to find supporting evidence for the overall cost savings that an om buds office can provide an institution
we might increase the chances of showing these potential savings by intentionally selecting only organizations that we know had multiple employee law suits prior to establishing an om buds office
these intentionally biased selections could highlight the differences in potential legal costs before and after establishing an om buds office
it is similar to assessing the view of particular policy by interviewing only mem be rs of one political party or by demonstrating we are underpaid by only collecting the salaries of om buds with over twenty years of service
for those interested in minimizing these particular problems the section below on sampling might be helpful
journal of the international ombudsman association alan jay lincoln selecting topic for research our research agenda included wide range of projects and research questions
this agenda provided one possible framework to guide potential research as we continue to learn more abut om buds their work and the impact on their organizations
some of these questions are exploratory inv es tig at ing an issue that we know very little about
there are few if any relevant studies in the literature to guide us
for example if we want to find out what our colleagues professional position was just before they became om buds we are unlikely to find prior studies to build upon or to examine trends across time
perhaps we are interested in the impact of work related stress on om buds
in these situations our early research initiatives might simply try to identify key issues and factors suggest possible patterns and test the feasibility of conducting more sophisticated stud
despite the scarcity of existing research on these topics with om buds we may not have to start from scratch
are there studies that have asked the same question about other occupations
can we find re search showing what clinical psychologists attorneys nurses or clergy did prior to their current profession
similarly we can draw upon the relevant theories and methodologies that other stress studies incorporated
the first survey that obtained salary in forma ti on likely was an exploratory study
there may have been attempts to fine tune questions assess whether respondents would divulge information decide how to handle part time workers and so on
exploratory research can help us familiarize ourselves with an issue satisfy our curiosity and help refine the strategy to conduct more careful and focused study
descriptive studies attempt to show us the patterns and range of the findings related to specific questions
by now the has conducted repeated member ship surveys looking at number of issues related to our on the job salaries of men and women size of office staff the nature of our org ani za ti ons
identifying regularities and patterns helps us understand what is occurring at given point in time or across specified time span
now we can describe patterns and trends in salaries of men and women in similar positions
perhaps we find that men still are being paid more than women but the gap is closing over time
being able to describe situation or pattern is essential to taking us to another level of understanding about the issues in question
explanatory studies attempt to tell us why something is occurring or why the patterns look the way they do
if our descriptive studies showed us that male om buds earned more than women om buds we probably want to take the next step and attempt to find out why this is occurring and why the gap is closing
perhaps we should find out if senior higher paid employees who retire are disproportionately male thereby closing the gap over time
perhaps women have approached their supervisors or human resources with requests for salary adjustments
these are two reasonable hypotheses that can be tested
with knowledge about patterns and trends we can focus on the reasons for change or lack of change
if we can develop what appear to be reasonable exp la nations of patterns and behaviors then we are in better position to start using the research findings to consider impacting future patterns and behavior
applied research can be helpful in evaluating our programs
how well what we mean by needs to be specified is particular strategy working
would visitors use our services again
as the data and information we gather through vari kinds of research continues to grow and become more reliable we may be in the position to ask how we can change situation
that is can we intervene in way that brings about desired outcomes
applied research not only provides information and guidance for possible policy changes but can be used to assess the impact of these changes
what might happen if we initiated civility training workshops re lo cat ed our office or added mediation to our available services
providing an option for certification is another example
we might anticipate the benefits of the new option but will need to verify the range and scope of the impact with follow up investigations
you may have noticed that there has not been dis cuss ion of values
it is difficult to answer the question should be done
even if we find that ing our office or adding mediation services would increase the use of our office the decision to make those changes rests on more than the data generated by our research
if we actually found that women are still being paid less than men should we advocate for equity reviews
what are the possible impacts of an equity review
what other relevant factors need to be considered and addressed
journal of the international ombudsman association alan jay lincoln given this wide variety of options in practical terms how do you choose research topic
most choices for potential research are influenced by one of the following
continuing work on issues from earlier studies
the potential for research support and funding opportunities
unusual events that spark our curiosity or need to know selected research methods observation most but not all behavior can be observed
in the majority of recent observational studies the participants are aware that they are being observed
there are variety of observation strategies that can be useful for om buds related research
unobtrusive observation occurs when the people being studied are unaware that they are part of research project
this technique might be considered when there is concern that knowing about your observations might change the activities in question
while this is legitimate concern covert observation raises number of ethical issues including the anonymity confidentiality informed consent use of data and possible negative impact
even if the behavior being observed typically is open to public view the question about how the information will be used remains an issue
the more you can insure the anonymity of the participants and minimize po ten ti al negative impact the more likely an institutional review board would approve the project
ethical issues are addressed more fully later in this paper
while unobtrusive research might seem like an easy way to gain access to individuals or groups that are unlikely to agree to being observed we should avoid this temptation
what might be legitimate use of unobtrusive observation
if our workplace has an increase in reported bullying or offensive communications we could learn more about the workplace culture by observing or language patterns use of personal space and casual physical contact in the cafeteria behaviors open to public view
these findings might give us sense of what is common behavior or perhaps considered appropriate in our setting
knowing this we might have better sense of what the boundaries are and what specific behaviors and activities might be perceived as harassing bully ing or vulgar in the same organization
direct observations avoid some of these ethical dilemmas because the people being observed are told you are there and know what you are doing
they have the option of agreeing or refusing and can stop the observation at any time
even if your presence is altering the typical behavior patterns that effect may decrease over time as trust is developed
we certainly need to avoid any deception or misinterpretation about what we actually are doing in the study
with direct observation we can observe people in their natural settings
if we are interested in how employ in small unit resolve minor disagreements and keep them from escalating we could seek approval to observe for day or two
the employees would know we are there what we are studying and how we will treat their identity and the information gathered
participant observation involves the researcher taking part in the activities and the setting
again this may be direct or unobtrusive and the same ethical issues need to be considered
as an om buds you pate in variety of activities with colleagues at work visitors and other om buds
if your participation also includes research component or data gathering then others should be fully informed about your pur pose strategies and possible use of the information
maintaining confidentiality and anonymity is es sen ti al and consistent with our sops
in these situations you have an opportunity to have the same or similar experiences as the other participants
this is good way to assess perceptions and experience the group dynamics
however the researcher needs to focus on maintaining objectivity
as om buds we participate in numerous mediations negotiations and discussions
if we want to know what strategies work best or how visitors react to different kinds of questions we can make these assessments as participant observer
journal of the international ombudsman association alan jay lincoln strengths of can help reveal the complexity and context of behavior in allows for the development of behavior over helps us identify patterns of behavior helps us understand why things are the way they are weaknesses of interpretation of what is observed may be background information may be unavailable the group may be being observed may alter difficult to gain difficult to replicate most observational studies case studies case studies are most appropriate when the goal of the research is to get extensive information about the history or current state of single unit
re search can be carried out not just with individuals but with single group organization community or even specific culture
new comb provides us with case study of one om buds office
she the conceptual thought process used to demonstrate very conservative cost savings es tim ate for one ombudsman office over three year period
specific supporting data while it does exist have been omitted due to the sensitive aspects of this information and the need to honor the confidential nature of the ombudsman role
an additional assumption was that the cost of one ombudsman salary benefits office space etc
was more than offset by many other savings associated with the topics which were not documented or quantified in this study
examined cases over three year period and determined how many were litigation sensitive using criteria that could be applied to any ombudsman case
only employment law related cases presenting high risk for litigation were eva lu at ed then determined how many of these litigation sensitive cases had been resolved in manner satisfactory to the client
our ombudsman office used the follow ing method to code cases upon clo sur ey yes problem solved and client is ha pp yn no problem not solved or not completely solved but client appreciates efforts made and is not indicating an interest in pursuing further remedies
problem not solved andor client not happy
only cases coded or defined as positive out comes were included in the study
new comb strengths of case case studies can help us generate hypotheses
they provide detailed information on individuals or organizations
we may get better understanding of process change and relationships
weaknesses of case vital information may be missing with particular case
the case may not be representative of others and it is difficult to generalize
surveys even people with little or no interest in research have had experience with surveys
there are several types of surveys including written oral and electron ic
as more people use the internet electronic mail and personal communication devices electronic sur are becoming more common
various web sites provide assistance in developing distributing and analyzing the survey
recently used an emailed survey to ask all of our reviewers and authors about their experiences with the journal
oral surveys often are used when there may be need to follow up with specific questions since the interviewer can make an and spontaneous adjustments on the spot
oral surveys can be administered in several different journal of the international ombudsman association alan jay lincoln ways including face to face or by phone
the imp or ta nt issues to consider when conducting survey are the format of the questions whether the questions meet the goals of the study and answer the research questions the appeal of the survey and process to potential respondents and the cost
palm quist suggests several strengths and weaknesses of surveys
strengths of surveys are useful in describing the characteristics of large population
surveys are relatively inexpensive and many ques ti ons can be included
they can be administered from remote locations using mail email or telephone
standardized questions make measurement more precise and allows for comparison between groups weaknesses of surveys are inflexible in that they require the initial study design the tool and administration of the tool to remain unchanged throughout the data collection
the researcher must ensure that large number of the selected sample will reply
it may be hard for participants to recall information or to tell the truth about controversial question
sampling probability sampling relies upon random selection from all the different units in the research population
each unit has an equal chance of being chosen
our reviewer and author survey pop ula ti on was small enough that we did not draw sample
we had complete list and contacted the entire study population all reviewers and authors
there are several types of probability samples including simple random stratified random systematic random cl us ter and multi stage simple random sampling is good way to select sample that will help us generalize about the results
it is an unbiased way of choosing who or what will be in study
this may be done by drawing names or numbers using list of random numbers etc
the im port ant point is that every item has an equal chance of being selected
if there is list of employee names telephone or id numbers we simply randomly select as many as we need for the sample
stratified random sampling involves dividing the population into similar subgroups men women or faculty staff students or medical staff administration patients and then selecting simple random sample from each subgroup
this helps insure that even sub groups that are very small will be represented in the study
we also will be able to make better com pari sons across groups
systematic random sampling occurs when you select every nth unit until you have the sample size you need
this approach assumes the list of sample units is randomly arranged
if you have employ and only need in the sample then starting at randomly selected point in the last every th employee is selected
starting at randomly selected location you could choose every fourth or fifth office in large facility to fill systematic random sample
cluster random sampling can be helpful when the study population is dispersed over wide area and the researcher would have to be present at each site
if the surveys are being completed electronically or by mail then this is not an issue
rather than rely on simple random sample which might require visiting each city county state or country the population can be divided into clusters and then random sample of clusters is selected for the study and all members of those clusters are contacted
cluster sample also is helpful when there is no complete listing of every unit in the population or compiling listing would be too costly
cluster sampling is valuable when cost savings are more important than some losses in precision
cluster sampling is used when groupings occur in the population such as counties city blocks schools hospitals comparable groups of people and so on
the sampled clusters ideally reflect the total population
at times we may need to use several sampling techniques in the same project
imagine having to sample all students in state uni system or all employees in chain of hospitals for interviews
we might begin selecting random cluster from the list of schools or hospitals
there may still be too many people to interview so we might consider simple random sample within each cluster
in this case we would have two stage sampling process
nonprobability sampling does not provide representative view of the population being studied
we do not know the probability of any particular item journal of the international ombudsman association alan jay lincoln being included in the sample and some items may be more likely than others to be selected
at times these samples may be useful or the only option available
convenience sample uses whatever cases are avail able
we might ask the first twenty people we see at the cafeteria if they have heard about the om buds of fice
we could ask everyone at conference session if they ever experienced sexual harassment
here is one creative example that uses convenience sample and at the same time avoids having to directly recontact visitors
northern illinois university campus newspaper recently announced the annual performance review of its ombudsman tim griffin
pursuant to the bylaws the university affairs committee of the university council will conduct the review and is soliciting information and comments from students faculty and staff before march
om buds bl og purposive samples are chosen with the hope that they will be somewhat representative of the pop ula ti on of interest
we try to select who or what we think is typical
this involves making judgments about the characteristics of the sample without always having history to review
pollsters have learned over the years that certain precincts are better predictors of districts or states than others so they purposively look at those election polls or results to make predictions
quota samples try to replicate the full population on certain important characteristics
if we know that our professional organization membership is male and female then we could use nonprobability sample that mirrors those distributions
that ni en ce sample of colleagues at our conference session also could include male and female
while quota samples may reflect some important character is tics or patterns of the study population they will not reflect all
content analysis earlier we mentioned that an om buds might have spotted what she thinks is pattern in the abusive and bullying em ails that targets are re ce iv ing
how can we verify that there really is pattern
if pattern does exist how should we describe or characterize it
in this situation we need to examine the actual content of the messages
be rel son defines content analysis as research technique for the objective systematic and quantitative description of manifest content of communications
the tech ni que can be use to identify words themes phrasing images and concepts that appear in almost any type of media or communications
while we are interested in email content we could examine speeches tele vi sion shows organization policies graffiti advertising and so on
content analysis is way of coding information by dividing the content into manageable categories
ideally the categories should be mutually exclusive and exhaustive
usually there is some pretesting to develop the code list or categories
we might start our analysis of bullying em ails by listing the varieties of bullying messages we have seen or heard about
what possible categories come to mind in this single example of bullying email
everybody knows that you get by on your looks
you keep showing off your stuff and things could happen
half the time your work is crap and have to cover for you
watching you and waiting for the day you screw up
and other messages might be threatening de grading vulgar sexual refer to personal appearance and so on

the ex peri mental method introduces control and enhances the ability to infer cause and effect
typically the researcher conducting an experiment changes one variable and maintains the other study variables
any observed differences should be the result of the ma ni pu lation or change
this is not foolproof the quality of the research design may impact the ability to deter mine causal effects
several good overviews can be found by doing web search of
the research setting also may impact the quality and power of an experimental study
brief discussion here of three basic experimental settings may be helpful
experiments can be conducted in laboratory setting in the field or there may be opportunities for naturally occurring experiments
laboratory experiments control most aspects of the research and change only one variable inde pen dent variable to assess the impact of that change on another variable dependent variable
if our theory or hypothesis is correct changes in the dependent variable are caused by the manipulation of the independent variable iv
if we can be certain that only the iv is changing then it is the source of change in the
while this may be limited option for om buds work it does provide model for other forms of experimentation
we might use laboratory setting to study the impact of the room temperature iv on the speed of decision making in small groups
we could select one hundred participants and randomly assign them to groups of four
each of the groups would be observed in the exact same setting and asked to recommend solution for the same problem
in half of the randomly selected group trials the room temperature is left at the normal degrees and in the other half we set the temperature at
are there differences in the time it takes the two types of groups to reach decision
if there is then we have reasonable explanation for the cause of these differences
randomly assigning our participants to the groups maximized matching on important factors such as age gender expertise and so on
strengths of laboratory experiments help us determine cause iv and effect maximizes control of important variables provides opportunities for replication weaknesses of laboratory experiments the situation may be artificial which limits the ab il to participants may try to do what they think the re searcher wants them to do demand participants often students may not be re pres en tat ive of the general population field experiments can minimize some of these problems while still retaining some of the strengths
the realistic setting allows for greater generalization and participants are less likely to react to the de mand characteristics
when my office computer was upgraded was able to listen to variety of streamed music
noticed that when light classical music was playing not only was more relaxed but my visitors appeared to be as well
this suggested possible re search question that would work well as field my of fice experiment
social psychologists have designed experiments to study issues as diverse as aggression shopping and donating behavior in the field
we do journal of the international ombudsman association alan jay lincoln lose some control but gain reality
when we mani pu late people or situations that impact people and they are unaware of the intrusion in their routine we need to be vigilant of the guidelines for ethical conduct in research
natural experiments might follow from events that occur outside of the research but lend themselves to follow up study and analysis
an advantage is that the setting is untouched by the researcher but replication is an unlikely option in most cases
we might measure the number of employee complaints that are filed with human resources on rainy day day when it has rained two or more days in row and day with no rain
if university changes its residence policies by increasing the proximity of men and women in dormitory or on floor we may want to know what happens to the number of sexual harassment claims
we can look at the number of claims before and after the change and even add additional dorms or floors that did not change as control
adding the control dorms or floors would help us rule out changes that occurred due to the passage of time and other extra neo us events
university housing is not situation we would normally manipulate solely for research purposes but may occur naturally or as part of policy change
what happens when an organization an no unc es that ten per cent of the workforce will be cut in the next ninety days does bullying increase or decrease do grievances rise or fall does absenteeism increase or decrease etc
following the attacks or other significant events we could have studied the number and types of complaints from or against international students or employees
the findings after could be compared with the comparable data before
these suggested studies will not be as powerful as fully controlled experiment because we cannot control all the relevant variables but we do have real setting and an opportunity to measure the impact of change in the environment on significant workplace behaviors
ethical considerations research participants must be treated with dignity
should consider establishing guidelines for the ethical treatment of research participants in any research conducted by or about om buds
we as om buds should consider our role in reviewing and monitoring research by or about our colleagues
articles published in that use data collected from or about the people we work with should conform to both recognized practices for ethical research and our sops
most health educational and other institutions receiving any federal support also have institutional review boards to examine and approve or exempt all research conducted by employees students and others affiliated with the institution
what needs to be done when that is not the case
guidelines for ethical research would be helpful
in their absence the responsibility for publishing research that adheres to ethical standards rests with the editors
the generally accepted guidelines for ethical re search are presented here
principles accepted as essential require men ts for the ethical conduct of human participant research are outlined in the bel mont report ethical principles and guidelines for the protection of human participants of research by the national com mission for the protection of human participants of biomedical and behavioral research
respect for persons incorporates the ethical con vi ct ions that individuals are treated as autonomous agents and persons with diminished autonomy are given protection
the conditions that follow from this principle are requirements for voluntary con sent to participate in research informed consent to participate in research protection of privacy and confidentiality and the right to withdraw from research participation without penalty
also see lincoln ro we and
beneficence do no harm implies an obligation to protect human participants from harm by assess ing the risks and benefits of the research designing studies so risk is minimized and potential benefits are maximized
journal of the international ombudsman association alan jay justice requires that the potential risks of re search should be born equally by the members of society that are likely to benefit from it
to apply this principle the researcher must evaluate the characteristics of the study population and ensure that the research project does not systematically select specific classes or types of individuals simply because of their ease of availability or their com promised position as opposed to reasons directly related to the problem being studied and the research project does not systematically exclude specific class or type of person who is likely to benefit from research participation or in whom the results of specific kind of research are likely to be applied

visitor contacts the om buds office upset about dis re behavior by former employee years ago
the visitor has taken numerous steps over the years to try to address the problem including contacting variety of individuals and offices on and off campus without satisfaction
the visitor has been unable to recover emotionally from the situation
many people come to om buds offices after having taken variety of informal andor formal routes to resolve their conflicts
despite these efforts num ber of visitors do not feel their conflicts have been resolved or are unsatisfied with the outcome
few exhibit significant psychological symptoms as result of the conflict the resolution process andor the aftermath and continue sometimes for decades to seek solutions to their problem
the challenge for om buds in these situations is how to help this latter group of visitors recover from the damaging ex peri en ce of their conflicts and prepare to move beyond the situation
although these visitors may need some form of psychological intervention to truly recover and referral to therapists is one tool om buds have in this type of situation there are other steps om buds can take that might help visitors
the conflict resolution literature including that on international violent andor intractable conflicts apologies and forgiveness offers ideas on how to understand the inability to recover from conflict and how to help visitors in this situation in addition number of concepts may be helpful from the realms of psychiatry and emotional intelligence
this is intended to be preliminary exploratory overview of the issue
as always in om buds work more in depth research would be enlightening
some case vignettes are offered to try to connect theory with actual om buds experiences
recovery from conflict cynthia joyce journal of the international ombudsman association cynthia joyce initial indicators of inability to recover from con flic ta former graduate student calls distraught over treat ment by faculty member over years ago and the effect this treatment has had on his life
the first indication that an om buds might be deal ing with visitor who has been unable to recover from problem is how long ago the problem hap pen ed these problems may have occurred decades previously
the visitor also frequently exhibits strong emotions including anger frustration and hurt and often insists on retelling his her story during every interaction with an om buds
as mentioned above the visitor may have taken number of steps to address the problem and in some cases apparent resolutions may have occurred for example formal process may have been completed
sometimes these visitors are labeled as or shoppers as they keep trying different offices to get satisfactory resolution to their problem
often the repeat visits and multiple phone calls by these visitors means that om buds spend more time on these cases than on many other cases combined
one concept that may be useful in understanding these visitors is that of personality as described by bill eddy of the high conflict institute
these individuals often have difficulty getting over conflicts
high conflict institute com gives the following clues to help third party identify that high conflict personality may be
you find yourself reacting strongly or outside your normal behavior
it seems that no matter what you do the conflict never gets resolved
you are personally and repeatedly attacked or criticized in an intensely negative way
you feel you have to defend people recover
faculty member believes she has been the victim of discrimination and harassment by administrators colleagues and staff in her department
over the course of years she has contacted numerous in di vi duals and departments on campus and has filed numerous complaints internally and at the state level
email exchanges have been constant vitriolic and addressed to the highest levels of administration and government
number of factors may contribute to in ability to recover from conflict including the effects of conflict itself personal characteristics of the in di vidual and the responses the visitor gets from others
it may be helpful to think about these visitors as having experienced traumatic event that has led to psychological damage in its most extreme form this can result in posttraumatic distress disorder vol pe
even though psychological trauma and pt sd usually result from extremely serious events natural or human caused disasters accidents etc
visitors who are unable to recover from difficult conflicts can share some of the characteristics of victims of more obvious trauma
effects of conflict in general the experience of conflict has negative effects on the people involved especially in situations with identity challenges helplessness andor unfair treatment
aaron beck in his book prisoners of hate the cognitive basis of anger hostility and violence describes tendency of people to fall into in conflict situations
in this type of thinking the threat of the offender and the vuln er ability of the victim are often highly exaggerated with the victim tending to perceive adversary as wrong or bad and the self as right and
negative rigid irrational and distorted perception of the other person leads to what beck calls the trap of of
this type of thinking is ex acer bated by mental illnesses such as paranoia
building on work bush and fol ger state in their book on transformative mediation the promise of mediation that brings sense of relative sense of lost control over their situation accompanied by confusion doubt journal of the international ombudsman association cynthia joyce uncertainty and indecisiveness
conflict also pro duces sense of people become suspicious hostile closed and impervious to the perspective of the other bush italics in original
clearly these effects of conflict can make it more dif fi cult for people in general to engage productively in conflict and recover from the experience of conflict
more serious effect of conflict is when it threatens the identity of the people involved
stone patt on and he en
write about identity chal leng es in the context of difficult conversations and describe identity as story we tell ourselves about ourselves
they hold that threats to identity can be deeply unsettling and through rush of adrenaline can result in feelings of anxiety anger depression hopelessness fear and desire to flee the situation
threats to identity may even cause individuals to let go of part of their self concept which can lead to intense emotional effects akin to mourning
kr ay bill affirms that damages the identity of participants and affects self esteem
no rt hr up states that to identity may cause or escalate and goes on to discuss the role of threats to identity in the maintenance and transformation of intractable conflicts
in particular no rt hr up and other authors discuss the need of humans to be able to predict and control their lives
no rt hr up describes identity as sense of the self and of the relationship of the self to the world
it is system of beliefs or way of construing the world that makes life predictable rather than random
in order to function human beings must have reasonable level of ability to predict how their behavior will affect what happens to them
the alternative random world with no rules would be deeply frightening and impossible to operate in
he points out the of human es tab lish maintain and protect sense of self meaning predictability and
and how stressful threatening and frightening threats to identity sense of self and an inability to anticipate the future are
vol pe describes one kind of trauma as resulting from betrayal by institutions on which people depend which can violate expectations and like other mat ic events be unexpected and uncontrollable
in the same vein se lig man an early researcher into helplessness defines it as psychological state that frequently results when events are uncontrol
he goes on to state that helplessness results in lack of motivation reduced ability to learn depression and anxiety
golem an in emotional intel lig en ce also discusses the deleterious effects of helplessness which can be emotionally overwhelm ing and contribute to permanent changes in the brain
lack of power can lead to less predictability more helplessness and more threats to identity
as result an unequal distribution of power can contribute to the intractability of conflicts and to the inability of individuals to recover from conflict
finally perception that he she has been treated unfairly or unjustly can contribute to an in ability to let the situation go
visitor can experience intense frustration and longstanding resentment through lack of understanding about what hap pen ed or why disbelief that appropriate policies and procedures were followed and perception of in eq ui ties in treatment or outcomes
the problem is com pounded when in the absence of clear information about why decision was made visitor makes the assumption that the situation was handled in appro pria te ly
two longtime experienced highly regarded em learn that new hire in their department was given significantly higher salary than they receive despite less experience in the work
pursuing informal and formal options does not produce any change in the situation despite what they perceive as obvious unfairness
personal characteristics reconciliation after violent conflict handbook bloom field points out that each re sp on se to trauma is highly individual and depends on his her personality structure personal resources coping strategies understandings of the cause of the event resilience and extended com mu support
bloom field adds that gender and age also may be relevant factors
other factors that can increase the likelihood of inability to recover from conflict include the high journal of the international ombudsman association cynthia joyce conflict personality pattern described by eddy vi si inability to assess conflict situation accurately victim mentality fixation on the problem mental illness brain chemistry and brain changes
the ability of visitor to understand conflict and as sess it realistically is critical in laying the ground work for successfully resolving problem and lack of this ability can contribute to visitor becoming locked into the problem
issues that interfere with effective assessment lack of insight into the situation inaccurate per cep ti ons of the inability to understand perspectives on the unwillingness to consider his her own contribution to the problem extreme focus on unfairness andor inappropriate unrealistic expectations for the outcome such as desire for revenge
how the visitor sees the situation can affect recovery from conflict
one approach to conflict management narrative mediation holds that people think about their experiences in stories and tend to develop stories about difficult situations that can become entrenched in their minds win slade
people may portray themselves as victims in these stories as the discussion above on helplessness suggests it can be particularly difficult to recover from conflict situation if visitor has victim men and sees him herself as completely vulnerable with no control over the situation and no resp on sib il for what happened
some personality disorders such as narcissism may exacerbate this pattern by making victim mentality more likely
it also can be problematic when identity is based at least in part on remaining angry andor not letting go of the situation
tint points out that people who focus on the past or who have fixed perceptions of past events may be less able to let go of the past and participate effectively in conflict resolution efforts
underlying problems such as mental health issues or addictions may contribute to ineffective assessment of conflict situations and given the frequency of these diagnoses they can affect significant prop or ti on of the populations om buds serve
large study in the united states revealed that of respondents reported at least one of psychiatric disorders including mood disorders and substance abuse over the course of their lives
grant presents data indicating that almost of adult americans have one or more personality disorders
psychiatric disorders can affect responses to conflict in variety of ways depending on the disorder
schizo phren ia for example which can affect visitors in dem ic settings in particular can include disorganized thinking diminished contact with reality and hal luc in at ions
narcissistic personality disorder is noted for the difficulty in seeing other viewpoints
paranoid personality disorder involves distrust of others which can lead to negative assumptions about the cause of conflict and steps taken toward resolution
border line personality disorder can have profound effects on interpersonal relationships including tendency to idealize or demonize others this can disrupt effective assessment of conflicts
description of high conflict people includes intense and variable emotions insistence on blam ing others victim mentality refusal to take resp on for the situation or solution inflexibility inability to see shades of grey inability to see points of view and even contempt for others and self centeredness
he also points out the inability of this personality type either to accept loss due to conflict or recover from it
to add to the challenge high conflict people often have personality disorders that exacerbate the situation
differences in brain chemistry that might not reach the level of mental health disorder may affect some response to conflict
for example reduced levels of serotonin key neurotransmitter in the brain have been associated with depression anxiety and increased of ca nul which can affect accurate assessment of conflict situation
bartlett points out that failure to forgive past wrong can lead to repetitive thoughts and dwelling on the past
just the act of thinking about negative incident in the past reduces brain function ing creativity and executive function defined as the center that organizes thought and regulates
journal of the international ombudsman association cynthia joyce conflict itself may cause changes in the brain at least in part through the inevitable emotional responses to conflict situations
in addition to emotional scarring from earlier life stresses which may make in divi du als more susceptible to changes in the brain due to traumatic events later in life golem an dam age may be done to the brain by revisiting ne ga experience over and over again
beck and lusk in describe process in which someone takes personally an action that hurts him her blames the offender for his her emotional responses and then creates narrative that casts him herself in the role of victim all while under the influence of stress related hormones
time we remember hurt we release stress chemicals into our bodies which prepare us to take fight or flight action lusk in
in the short run these chemicals affect the ab il to think clearly in the long run these chemicals can change the brain and also affect physical health
when emotions which predispose us to take action are combined with an inability to take action they can cause feelings of repeat vi ct imi za ti on and our bodies suffer without the outlet of ac ti on lusk in
in the extreme case of posttraumatic stress disorder there may be an over se cretion of the primary stress hormone that mobilizes fight flight responses or corticotrophin releasing hormone golem an
through this mechanism the body is prepared for an emergency that does not ex ist
this mechanism also can result in hyper vigilance or increased sensitivity to possible threats including psychological to the individual golem an which can precipitate or worsen conflicts
an employee had negative interaction with coworker and insists on retelling the story at every meeting and during every phone call
everything that has happened in the workplace since the incident is colored by the event
the visitor firmly believes that he has been victim and has no responsibility for the situation
the preoccupation with the si tua ti on and the stress the employee feels seem to contrib ute to reduction in job performance breakdown in interpersonal relationships damage to the reputation and eventual job loss
previous responses by others certain responses by third parties can increase the likelihood that visitor will not recover from conflict
number of authors eg bloom field hale describe common responses by third parties to visitor st rug gl ing with conflict recovery as over it and move on
third parties may respond in this way in part out of frustration with these visitors especially if num ber of steps have been tried already to resolve the problem
in addition third parties may not recognize the emotional impact the conflict has had on the vi si tor
unfortunately the suggestion to move on from the conflict is unrealistic and just exacerbates the situ ati on as visitor feels unheard and disrespect ed and loses trust in others
another dynamic that can be especially difficult occurs when the other person in conflict does not believe anything inappropriate was done but the visitor feels seriously harmed
an example of this would be when an employee loses his her job during probationary period due to poor performance
the visitor may feel personally damaged by this ex peri en ce which may have significant ramifications for the future while the supervisor believes that the action taken was reasonable and appropriate and followed all guidelines and procedures
in particular if the visitor sees him herself as victim but others in situ ati on do not this can make recovery even more dif fi cult since inevitably the visitor will not get responses from others that are satisfactory
what can help people recover from conflict
bloom field points out that just as re sp on se to conflict is very individual the path each healing needs to take is unique
the ques ti ons om buds face in situations involving visitors unable to recover from conflict include what can help someone heal
how can the individual let go of the wounding experience in order to move forward with his her life
how can the om buds help with these processes
sometimes the other people involved in conflict situation are unavailable or unwilling to help in these processes in which case the om buds may journal of the international ombudsman association cynthia joyce need to work with the individual to develop options for emotional recovery on his her own
in other situ at ions the other party is willing and able to help with steps toward recovery from the conflict
help for an individual visit ora number of approaches may help someone recover from conflict by addressing damage to identity and feelings of helplessness and by mitigating previous unsatisfactory responses by third parties
some im port ant elements of an effective approach recognition of the perspective of the visitor allow ing the visitor to talk about what has recognition of the emotional trauma experienced by the understanding the concerns about justice and unfair responding to concerns about reputation and helping the person develop options for next steps especially options for helping the visitor change his her perspective on the situation
eddy talks about or attention re spect as useful approach for high conflict people
in this approach third party focuses on expressing empathy for the situation giving the visitor time and attention with patience and showing re spect for the visitor and his her perspective
interest ing ly eddy suggests that diagnostic tool to identify when the approach is most important is noting when third party such as an om buds does not feel empathetic and interested in offering attention and respect due to the challenging characteristics of the visitor
in memory and conflict resolution tint points out the importance of allowing people in conflict to talk about the past and the emotions they feel about past events
in particular helping visitors remember not only the painful past but more positive memories can help them move out of experiences of loss and victim mentality
as third parties in conflict management know it can be extremely difficult for visitors to think about positive future without giving them time to explore the past in fact encouraging people to focus on the future prematurely can cause resistance and further in the tint
tint also points out that people with more power in situation may be more willing to look ahead to the future so allowing visitor to discuss the past may help to address power inequities that may be present
the transformative mediation approach includes recognition of the damage done to the parties by conflict and suggests empowering visitors by helping them gain control of the situation make decisions and take action bush
om buds can help by brainstorming ideas with visitor that may help him her move past the conflict such as meeting with the other person writing letter to the other person ex pressing the concerns asking for an apology or asking for some sort of restitution
pointed ques ti on that can help is can help you feel better about this situation
particular it can be very helpful for om buds to provide information to visitors on how decisions were made that adversely affected them this can counter the negative assumptions people often make about decision making processes that have negative con se qu enc es
psychotherapy may help visitor trying to recover from conflict and om buds can provide list of mental health providers in their community
treatment for psychiatric disorders that might contribute to the situation and the perception of the situ ati on is very important but therapy also can help visitor come to terms with situation that is not going to change
no rt hr up and bloom field point out that psychotherapy can help with changing the identity of someone caught in conflict for example by helping someone move from self concept as victim to one of survivor or by helping someone whose identity is built around the conflict recognize this and possibly change it
lusk in encourages process that includes recognizing that the other person did not cause the emotional response acknowledging that humans make mistakes changing the ti on al response and changing the identity as victim
journal of the international ombudsman association cynthia joyce since the story visitor tells him herself about the conflict can contribute to entrenchment of his her views the narrative mediation approach suggests ways to help visitors develop new more positive narrative about the situation through the following ask the person to tell his her story
help the person see the history of the problem implying that there were experiences before the problem started and possible conclusion in the future
demonstrate compassion for the person and his her story and respect for the ability to take control over his her story
show the ability to see contradictions avoid simp li fy ing the people involved
talk about the effect of the conflict on the person
help the person the conflict story by asking questions about the story helping the per son see the problem as external to the parties in vo lv ed thereby reducing blame reassessing roles assigned in the story to move away from mentality and asking if the person wants the conflict story to continue in his her life given its effects on him her
help the person develop new story by looking at exceptions to the conflict story eg examples of incidents where interactions went well and looking forward to the future win slade
there is significant literature on forgiveness as an in dividual process that can help someone recover from traumatic experiences including conflicts
enright clarifies that forgiveness is not forgetting and is not the of angry feeling across rather forgiveness is and takes
he also states that forgiveness involves mercy and letting go of the need for justice
hart well describes forgiveness as involving acceptance of pain that should never have happened empathy toward the other person and letting go of resentment and points out that an apology is not essential for forgive ness to take place
hart well also suggests that the root ti on of both forgiveness and are opposite sides of the same
when faced with visitor who seeks revenge rather than forgiveness om buds can voice this interest and talk about the practicality of revenge the possible consequences for the visitor and the other person and the appropriate limits of the om buds role
visitor believes that colleague made false acc usa ti ons about sexual harassment against him
he has contacted number of departments on campus to complain about the situation with the ultimate goal of revenge by having the colleague lose his her job
involvement of others in the conflict apologies and reconciliation are two options that in others in the conflict situation and that can help individuals recover from conflict
om buds can assist by facilitating these processes
if the other person in conflict is available and willing an apology can help someone who feels wronged recover
schneider points out the paradox that an apology cannot actually change the past and undo past damage yet it still has the potential to repair the damage to the victim in way that nothing else can
what makes it work in view is role reversal in an effective apology the wrongdoer gives up power and puts him herself at the mercy of the other person
schneider considers important elements of apologies to be sincerity an acknow le dg ment of wrongdoing and an acceptance of resp on for the harm done visible emotional effect on the wrongdoer expression of the vulnerability of wrongdoer the wrongdoer not offering defense of his her actions promise that the situation will not reoccur and sometimes restitution
even if the person who may have taken the hurtful action is not available or willing to apologize sometimes the om buds can arrange an apology from someone else in the ins ti tu ti on that might serve the same purpose
reconciliation is wellknown concept especially in international conflicts and is conflict resolution pro cess designed to promote healing and restore peace relationships
john paul lede rach highly journal of the international ombudsman association cynthia joyce regarded writer and practitioner in international conflict resolution defines reconciliation as process that involves four often contradictory elements truth mercy justice and peace
in contrast with forgive ness which is an individual process enright describes reconciliation as together by two people
bloom field states that ati on refers both to process and the end goal and the relationship between
reconciliation may help address many of the rea sons why visitors are traumatized by conflict such as strong emotions and challenges to reputation dig ni self esteem and identity
kr ay bill sees the key part of reconciliation as restoring identity which involves recognizing emotions especially of hurt and anger then reclaiming self worth and validity of needs
these needs are emotional or symbolic for example acknowledgement of mistakes andor apologies
hau ss sees recon cilia ti on as an opportunity to help the parties and overcome the pain brought on during the
reconciliation often refers to cases with clear cut offenders and victims
this is rarely true in om buds work but the principles of reconciliation may guide facilitation of meetings to resolve situation
it is dif fi cult to move towards reconciliation when only one party to conflict is willing to engage in the process which can happen for example if the situation hap pen ed in the distant past but sometimes another representative of the organization can participate
lede rach points out that whenever only one of the elements of reconciliation is emphasized by the parties involved it can be challenging to resolve the situation
this can occur for example when visitor only focuses on justice it can be difficult for others in the situation to meet the needs around this element of reconciliation when the other elements are ignored
lede rach highlights key paradox of reconciliation the simultaneous acknowledgment of painful past and vision of positive future
acknowledging this with visitors may help as om buds recognize the pain accept that changing the past is not pos sib le and help move the visitor to envisioning what positive future might look like and how to get there
conclusion greater understanding of why some visitors are unable to recover from conflict can enrich om buds practice and imbue standard elements of the om buds skills et such as listening with empathy support ing discussion of the past and brainstorming action steps with greater importance
the concepts and strategies outlined here may help om buds person ally as we deal with visitors unable to recover from conflict may help these visitors even partially move on with their lives and may help our institutions as they grapple with these often intractable situations
there is hope that om buds as one resource involved among many can make things better tempered by sober realization that the extensive time and energy these situations demand may not lead to improve ment
despite substantial efforts on the parts of many people none of the examples cited in this article have been resolved

journal of the international ombudsman association last year chuck book gave legal context to the work of organizational ombudsmen in the united states
however there has not yet been comparable guide for practice and management issues of org ani zati on al ombudsmen the booklets and study binders created by and its predecessors notwithstanding
the ombudsman handbook by james jr and patricia aims to fill this gap
the book is written specifically as manual for those establish ing the and it offers management view of the profession
it must be noted initially that the authors do not focus on organizational ombudsmen alone
instead the book is intended for ombudsmen more broadly even those ombudsmen that go by other titles such as patient advocate complaints officer and customer satisfaction manager
moreover the book is written not just for practicing ombudsmen but also man ag ers and executives especially in human resources and professors and students in business and public administration programs
the scope of the book reflects the backgrounds of its authors
consulting experience and research has focused on external ombudsman pro grams that serve patients and customers
background is in public relations and comm uni ca ti ons and she has worked as an ombudsman at large teaching hospital mcg ill university health centre
they see ombudsmen primarily as tool for im prov ing customer care either directly or via improved employee satisfaction and efficiency
the book is organized into three sections
the first section gives some context to the current om buds man landscape
chapter one identifies the internal and external factors that are driving more org ani za ti ons and industries to develop ombudsman pro grams
the second chapter discusses mechanisms for handling complaints and how ombudsmen are involved in those processes
chapter three tracks the development of om buds man programs in several different industries and marks the first mention of organizational om buds men
here the authors acknowledge the skepticism that many classical government and legislative om buds men have toward the purported independence and confidentiality of organizational ombudsmen
in chapter four the authors define the three core ac ti vi ties of ombudsmen complaint processing education and training and consultation
this gives the work of ombudsmen context and sets up the application of other management theories later in the book
the second section of the book is guide for human resources managers on implementing an effective ombudsman program
chapter five illustrates the development of formal ombudsman program within corporation from assessment through design and startup
chapter six explores how ombudsmen derive and use authority and power
many practicing organizational ombudsmen assert that they do not have any actual power but the authors identify six distinctive sources of power that underlie the work of ombudsmen

here organizational ombudsmen will recognize many aspects initial case consultations background research visitor counsel ing meetings with senior executives networking with other ombudsmen making referrals and facilitating meetings

soft cover tom kos ako ws ki journal of the international ombudsman and confidentiality
in chapter the authors survey ethical and legal issues with particular focus on the code of ethics
chapter considers how organizations evaluate and control their ombudsmen using the framework of peter theories on management
chapter reviews the impact of an ombudsman on the various subsystems of an organization revealing wide ranging effects
chapter wraps up number of additional topics including the job benefits for practitioners and concludes with forecast of continued growth in the ombudsman field
the book may not be an appropriate introductory text for the organizational ombudsman field because there is no clear summary of the important differ enc es between the several kinds of ombudsmen
the index for example does not have an entry for either or the states ombudsman association the primary professional group for classical and legislative ombudsmen
it is not until the second chapter that the authors begin to draw any distinctions between types of practice and then it is only between and ombudsmen
although there are several references to standards of practice and code of ethics there is no explanation of how or why these differ from other ombudsman standards
for this reason readers with out some basic understanding may be confused
true to its subtitle the book is most relevant where it offers new perspectives for creating and administer ing an ombudsman program
the analysis of how ombudsmen should be evaluated for example is especially valuable
the authors apply peter approach to management control to create guide for ombudsman program designers and supervisors using seven design characteristics
ie ombudsman managerial controls should be economical mean appropriate congruent timely simple and operational
the authors conclude that because an work is personal and people based control system should reflect the basic nature of the work
similarly the book provides an innovative analysis of the various positive effects an ombudsman has on an subsystems those benefits that concern many ombudsmen
practicing organizational ombudsmen will gain new insights from the analyses and the book is destined to become an essential resource for the field

deposition testify subpoena publicity motion for
protective order it is recurring nightmare after working every day for months or perhaps years confidentially helping people find options to resolve workplace conflict or report matters of concern to formal channels the ombudsman learns one day that he or she is now the center of very public controversy
the details can vary from reading about it in newspaper to re ce iv ing call from the general office stating that they have just received subpoena for the om buds man
worse yet the message may be that the om buds man or the office has been named in complaint that has been filed in court
it is at this point that panic reaction sets in
what can he or she say to those who ask what this is all about
is there anything the ombudsman can say publically to defend the ombudsman or the office
these are only few of the many questions that come flooding through the mind of the om buds man when the nightmare turns out to be real
the good news though is that while this may still seem like nightmare there are some practical steps that an ombudsman can take now to minimize the panic and disruption and to maximize the likelihood that the ombudsman and his or her office can navigate the crisis with their reputations and practices intact
in offering the following suggestions am only try ing to outline general points for consideration
am not offering specific legal advice which of course is always dependent on an analysis of the particular facts at issue and the applicable law
protecting confidentiality considerations for the ombudsman subjected to adverse publicity or subpoena to testify charles howard journal of the international ombudsman association charles howard things to do now before the crisis many ombudsmen as well as the executives administrators and in house lawyers with whom they routinely work regularly fail to appreciate that effectively dealing with an adverse publicity or subpoena crisis almost always depends on the steps that are taken before the crisis occurs
this means that there are things that should be done now before any of the dreaded triggering events of crisis occur
the simple reason is that once publicity or subpoena puts an ombudsman program under the magnifying glass all of the fundamentals relating to such issues as how the ombudsman office is established why it is important and how it operates are essentially frozen in time
yet the answers to these questions are critical to the issue of preserving confidentiality
at the point the crisis occurs it is almost always too late to address items missed or change the facts on which the pro gram and its claim of confidentiality will be assessed
remember that issues in lawsuits are analyzed on the basis of the facts as they were at the time the dispute arose without consideration of changes that may thereafter be made
the single biggest step an ombudsman can do to prepare for possible crisis is to make sure that documentation relating to the office is as complete as possible
if the office and the org ani za ti on have not previously adopted charter or other formal understanding that forms the foundation on which the office operates that should be done now
this is perfect place to describe why the office was created and why it is important to the organization
it should also set forth the principles on which the office is expected to operate independence neutral informality and confidentiality as well as the code of ethics and standards of practice and any exceptions to confidentiality
reporting channels and other programmatic features of the office that support those principles should be included
creating such charter is important because in any sub se quent dispute involving the office the charter will be key piece of evidence that can be used to support confidentiality
conversely the opposite is also true without charter which considers to be best practices standard it is harder to convincingly assert that the bases for confidentiality were fully articulated and that the relevant constituency was adequately informed of the way in which the office operates
two of the most important features of charter relate to the issue of imputed notice and the underpin for the claim of confidentiality
although it is beyond the scope of this article to present an ex tended discussion of the legal basis for asserting that properly created organizational ombudsman office is not place for imputed notice of claims against the sponsoring entity it is vitally important that do cu mentation state that the ombudsman office is not proper channel to give the organization notice of claims that someone may have
likewise all too often ombudsmen assert that communications with an om buds man are privileged while the issue of whether communications will in fact be considered privileged depends on the court the jurisdiction involved the adequacy of the documentation and practices that comply with that documentation
it is better to state that communications with the ombudsman office are considered confidential
going step further it can be stated that the code of ethics and standards of practice and hopefully the office will claim that com munic at ions are privileged because this allows the office to assert claim of privilege in appropriate cir cum stances while not categorically representing that communications have in fact been determined to be privileged
articulating claim of confidentiality also gives the office and the organization the opportunity to document potential bases for asserting con fid en ti ality other than privilege
one of the most significant of these other bases is what is often described as the that the ombudsman program is made available to its constituency with the un der standing that those who use the office agree to abide by the principles upon which the office was established
depending on the jurisdiction involved an ombudsman office may also rely on confidentiality based on mediation or other statutory provisions
charter is only the starting point for proper do cu mentation
publically available information about the office is very important and especially so for large multiple site entities
this should include in forma ti on that can be accessed electronically as well as in print form
examples include posters videotapes frequently asked questions speeches articles about journal of the international ombudsman association charles howard the office and brochures
the message given through all of this publicity should be consistent and reiterate the key principles on which the office operates and on which confidentiality is asserted
exceptions to confidentiality and the issue of imputed notice must be addressed simply and consistently
the failure to present the key programmatic features of the office in each of these forms of publicity can be problem
couple of examples have en co un ter ed demonstrate the importance of this point
an ombudsman was deposed in case in which the plaintiff claimed that the only information about the office that he had seen was conveniently the only brochure that did not explicitly describe the con fid en ti ality of the office
the claim of confidentiality was in fact described elsewhere in newer brochures but the employee claimed that he had not seen and was not aware of the other descriptions of the office
on another occasion brochure mentioned that among the issues that could be discussed with the om buds man were claims of harassment and discrimination but that brochure was silent on the issue of the ombudsman office not serving as notice channel for the organization
that warning was stated elsewhere but again the plaintiff asserted that the first brochure was the only one he had seen and that therefore discussing such claims with the ombudsman put the entity on notice
third category of documentation documentation of the internal policies and procedures of the office is easy to overlook principally because it is viewed as internal to the ombudsman office rather than pub li to those outside of the office
yet paradoxically such information or the lack of it can be highly relevant in litigation because these policies and pro ce dures cannot be claimed to be confidential com mu ni cations
indeed even if an ombudsman does prevail on motion for protective order to be excused from testifying with respect to confidential comm uni ca ti ons there is virtually no basis on which an om buds man would be able to avoid testifying as to the general policies and procedures used by the office to handle inquiries
the internal policies and procedures relating to what confidential information is kept and when and how it is to be destroyed are of paramount importance
if responses to questions in this line of inquiry reveal that procedures have not been estab lish ed or if established the procedures have not been complied with arguments over confidentiality may be doomed from the start
related documentation issue is access to data
with the ubiquitous use of computers and email comm uni cations where is confidential data kept and who has access to it are of critical importance
in this regard while it may be important for the ombudsman to be connected through email servers to others in the organization strongly recommend that confidential data should not reside on the servers
final area of documentation is information that does not originate from the ombudsman office
for example the review should include looking at how the organization refers to the ombudsman office in documents created elsewhere in the organization
it has not been unusual for general business ethics code or policy on harassment and dis cr imi na ti on to indicate that issues related to those forms of misconduct may be to the ombudsman office
another example is that descriptions of other functions or offices can be described in the same way that the ombudsman office is described
if another office such as compliance or hr makes reference to ability to report matter confidentially to those channels the question that will arise in court then becomes what does mean when it is used in both that context as well as the context in which the ombudsman office operates
these areas have proven to be some of the most intractable areas for ombudsman to address because they often involve internal organizational politics but that makes them no less important as the threat of dilution of the confidentiality message from these other sources is very real
one of the hardest conversations for many om buds men is the discussion over the need for access to outside counsel yet such discussion also should take place well in advance of any crisis
when having this conversation with executives or administrators of an organization or its in house counsel there are three critical points that need to be made
first as demonstrated above the time to estab lish the documentation for the office and thus the framework for defending any challenge to the office is before there challenge
legal audit by lawyer knowledgeable about ombudsman issues is not gen er ally an expensive or time consuming process but the improvements or supplements to the do cu menta ti on can make all the difference if and when there is challenge to the program
journal of the international ombudsman association charles howard second the claim of confidentiality is what makes the ombudsman office different from other formal channels and represents the value to the organization added by an ombudsman office
moreover the claim of confidentiality is not just one of the principles on which an organizational office depends it is also byproduct of creating an office that is independent neutral and informal
without adherence to these other principles claim of confidentiality is not sustainable
the principle of independence is par ticul ar ly important plank in the platform supporting the claim of confidentiality
independence is the first ethical principle in both the code of ethics and its standards of practice
in articulating best practices as commentary and supplement to the standards of practice has recognized that critical aspect of independence is the right to independent counsel the ombudsman should obtain assurance from the organization at the outset and apart from any particular dispute of access to outside legal counsel at his or her own discretion
the expense of outside counsel should be covered by the organization and included in the overall budget for the ombudsman office
the om buds man should have an understanding with the organization that the ombudsman is not required to inform the organization when it communicates with or accesses outside counsel
the practical effect of the failure to have inde pen dent counsel can be significant particularly when as discussed below it becomes necessary for motions to be filed in court
in one of the early challenges to ombudsman confidentiality the entity for which the ombudsman worked filed the motion for protective order on behalf of the office
the plaintiff opposed the motion however on the grounds that the office was not truly independent and that the communications could not be held to be confidential if for no other reason than because both the office and the entity were represented by the same lawyer
the argument was that that the lawyer representing both would have had conflict of interest in the dual re pres en ta ti on if the office and the entity were independent of each other
it was only after separate and inde pen dent counsel appeared for the ombudsman office that the court granted the motion for protective order
third it is important for the ombudsman and for the organization to recognize that the role of outside counsel for the ombudsman office is not to the sion of legal advice from in house counsel or regular counsel for the entity
there are many occasions where the relevant legal issue relates to policies of the organization and do not relate to or impinge on the issue of confidential communications
in those si tua ti ons it is appropriate for the counsel to pro vide advice
resorting to independent counsel is both unnecessary and impractical
on issues that implicate the independence of the office and preservation of confidential communications however the need for outside counsel is clear in order for the proper ti on ing of the office is to be maintained
likewise on overall strategy for how to deal with challenges to the ombudsman office both the counsel and outside counsel should have role
ideally they would be working cooperatively albeit from different perspectives to help sustain the value of the om buds man program that the organization has established
public attacks on the ombudsman office the code of ethics and standards of practice contain several provisions that limit the ability to disclose information
standards of practice sections through direct an ombudsman not to disclose the identity of inquirers not to maintain records containing identifying information on behalf of the organization to assert claim of confidential and privilege and require steps to safeguard what confidential information the office has and to destroy it when it is no longer needed
while it is important to adhere to these standards to preserve confidentiality they should not serve as complete muzzle on the ombudsman when public crisis occurs involving the office
there are occasions when ombudsman offices become embroiled in public controversy that an ombudsman may be able to make limited comments either to people in his or her organization who are inquiring or to broader audience
for example not every communication with an om buds man is confidential
as discussed above general office practices and procedures are not confidential journal of the international ombudsman association charles howard and it may be appropriate for an ombudsman to offer an explanation of how the office operates without disclosing any confidential communications
again these are not confidential communications and the manner in which the ombudsman conducts his or her professional activities in general is fair area for inquiry and disclosure
if an exception to confidentiality was used to make limited disclosure an ombudsman would likely be required to reveal that he or she made the deter mi nation that the exception to confidentiality was appropriate and then what was disclosed
likewise when an ombudsman is given permission to make disclosure to formal channel such as hr or com pli an ce and then does so that communication is likely notice event for the organization and the om buds man cannot properly assert confidentiality to avoid disclosing to an in house counsel for example what had been disclosed to the formal channel
note the ombudsman should still claim that the conversation with the inquirer is confidential it was only the sub sequent and perhaps more limited disclosure with permission that would not be confidential
none of these areas where disclosure or comment is permitted really helps address the larger and often more strident inquiry about what was said to the ombudsman or eliminate questions put to the ombudsman often by others in the or ga ni zati on about how the plaintiff could possibly be making the claims he or she is asserting without the ombudsman advising the organization about it
an example of this type occurred on one occasion when an ombudsman office was named in complaint filed in court in connection with an allegation that the plaintiff had disclosed to the ombudsman conduct by another person that could fairly be said to qualify as an imminent threat of serious harm
the problem of course was that the allegations in the complaint were not what had actually been disclosed to the om buds man
in situations such as this the ombudsman was not able to contradict the allegations in the complaint without breaching confidentiality
the ombudsman was able however to reaffirm to in house counsel that it had consistently practiced in accordance with the code of ethics and standards of practice
in other words the ombudsman was implying without disclosing confidential communications that if such conduct had been disclosed to the ombudsman there would have been an applicable exception to confidentiality and the ombudsman would have made disclosure to the appropriate person
in the final analysis the ombudsman should rec that public defense of the office and the confidentiality of particular communications is best left to others in the organization
depending on the facts the public defense of the office can emphasize the overall importance of the office to the org ani za compliance or corporate governance efforts or to provide assistance to the employees to improve the workplace environment and resolve workplace conflicts
if however the dispute has resulted in legal action defense of the om buds man office is best left to motions filed in court by the counsel working in conjunction with counsel for the organization
responding to subpoena or document and testimony demands on the ombudsman start with what subpoena is it is legal paper that in effect orders person to appear at particular time and place usually court for trial testimony or office for deposition and can include demand that specified documents also be produced
while there are administrative proceed in gs in which subpoenas may be issued subpoena almost always indicates that matter is in litigation
in other words lawsuit has been filed and someone usually the plaintiff who on some earlier occasion consulted with the ombudsman believes that the ombudsman has information that is relevant to the claims asserted in the lawsuit
there are essentially two ways an ombudsman may learn that he or she is being subpoenaed or compelled to provide testimony or documents
the first is that sheriff or marshal may appear at the home or office and personally the subpoena on the ombudsman
if this occurs the ombudsman should immediately notify the ate legal office for the organization that subpoena has been served and forward copy of it to them
the second way and by far the most common way is to receive one of those heart stopping calls from the lawyers indicating that another party in journal of the international ombudsman association charles how ar da lawsuit which the ombudsman may not even know anything about has notified the organization that they want to depose or obtain documents from the ombudsman
in this latter situation there may not be subpoena at all most court rules allow for one party in lawsuit to provide of its intention to ob tain discovery here deposition and or documents from another party
once the ombudsman learns of an effort to obtain documents or testimony from him or her or their office there are some important considerations to re member
first independent counsel for the om buds man office should be notified or retained if that has not previously been done
second since most court rules require objections or motions addressed to subpoena or notice of deposition to be filed within certain time period which is often quite short there is need for prompt action
in this regard counsel for the organization and the ombudsman office can advise on when and how any such motion should be filed
it is extremely important to calendar the date by which any such motion must be filed
third once the ombudsman learns of legal attempts to obtain testimony or documents any otherwise routine document destruction that relates to the issues in dispute must cease
because this is bright line prohibition the ombudsman office should at all times take seriously the admonition to maintain as few records as possible and that document retention and destruction policies be rigorously complied with
indeed even before subpoena or notice arrives the ombudsman may be under an obligation to preserve any relevant documentation
the current practice in many courts in the united states is that when an entity anticipates that litigation is reasonably likely in dispute or matter counsel for the organization send out hold to people and offices in the organization that may have relevant in forma ti on
such letters instruct the recipients to preserve and forward to the counsel any such relevant paper or electronic information
while dis clo sure of any information from the office is more complicated issue that should be discussed with the independent counsel there should be complete compliance with the direction to preserve any information that exists at the time litigation hold letter subpoena or notice of deposition is received
fourth the ombudsman should realize that there will be great pressure by lawyers and others in the organization to us what this is all about
this is the moment of greatest vulnerability for om buds men because the institutional pressure on them will be great
it is not uncommon for the request to come in the form of directive the ombudsman must disclose all known facts so that the organization can defend the claims and the ombudsman in dep osi ti on
if such disclosure is made however the chances for successful defense of claim of confidentiality are seriously undermined
it would be highly unlikely for court in ruling on motion for protective order that may be filed to permit disclosure to one party the organization without ordering disclosure to an opposing party
far better approach for both the organization and the ombudsman is for the office to reaffirm its commitment and practices to the code of ethics and standards of practices and to work with the organization to oppose any such attempts to compel testimony or documents from the om buds man office
formal motion to quash the subpoena or motion for protective order should only be used as last resort
it has not been uncommon for such attempts to compel information from the of fice to be resolved informally
bringing us back to the starting point particularly good charters and brochures that describe the way the office operates and that state that those who use the office agree to respect those principles can be particularly effective in persuading opposing counsel to yield
telephone call from either counsel for the organization or co un sel for the ombudsman office armed with this type of program documentation can sometimes resolve the dispute over compelling documents or testimony from the ombudsman
this approach can be especial ly effective when the claims for confidentiality do not rest exclusively on an assertion of privilege
if er such informal attempts to resolve the dispute over testimony or documents from the ombudsman office are unavailing timely motion must be filed
and finally if any such motion is to be filed it must provide both factual and legal bases for granting the relief requested
it is the obligation of the party making the motion to demonstrate why it should be granted
this is frequently accomplished with aff ida journal of the international ombudsman association charles howard vi ts and legal argument but the lessons of carman mc don nell douglas corp
should not be forgotten the lack of an adequate factual record for granting motion for protective order will be fatal
in appropriate cases it may be ap propria te to offer to provide information to the court in camera that is to disclose it to the court only for preliminary determination without making dis clo sure to the other parties to the lawsuit
conclusion confidentiality is frequently described as the defining characteristic of an ombudsman office and for good reason since it is the commitment to con fi den ti ality that makes the ombudsman office different from other resources and formal channels
apart from making the work of an ombudsman possible and important however confidentiality also limits the ways in which an ombudsman can defend himself or herself when public controversy occurs
some lim it ed disclosures or explanations about the office may be possible but generally there is little that the om buds man can say or do publically without breaching confidentiality
when the controversy spills over into lawsuit there are ways and good ones at that in which an ombudsman can provide defense for the office and its practices
particularized advice always depends on the specific facts and circumstances but the general approach is clear an ombudsman should be prepared in advance with good documentation and independent counsel and then when the crisis comes the office and its organization as well as their counsel can work cooperatively to preserve ti on that they all consider important

by way of introduction was the ombudsperson at cal tech during the time when the institute was sued by staff member and the om buds office was named in the suit
watched this landmark case wend its way through the california court system in
was in court with san di cooper general counsel who was so instrumental in helping determine the outcome of this case while the case was debated and the verdict announced
it was quite an amazing experience
has asked me to write short article for this issue of the journal and speak about the particulars of the case
in many ways the stage was set for this situation several years prior to the case when was hired as the ombudsperson in
at the same time san di cooper was new member of the general office and had issue with the fact that not lawyer was granted confidentiality by the cal tech admin is tr ati on
several meetings about this occurred in the office the outcome being that dr thomas ever hart then president of the institute declared that he stood by my confidential role and general counsel to me
although he knew that by law did not have confidentiality rights he put this in writing
more than few feathers were ruffled
later that year equal employment opportunity commission ee oc came on campus to investigate sexual harassment complaint
san di asked me what if anything could share with her about sexual harassment on the campus
was able to answer that request by sharing demographic information that would later be in my annual report to the community
gave her number with no further information
none of those visitors whom had counseled had sur faced on her radar none had filed further complaint and each had reported that the harassment had ended
she knew of one case knew of complaints
from then on all om buds were friends of and later on san di gave her time without charge to helping the om buds community in any way she could
few years later in cal tech was sued by staff member ms gar stang regarding an issue of
she felt that rumors were circulating around the campus defaming her
while it was true that both the om buds office and human resources employee lessons learned revisit to the gar stang vs
journal of the international ombudsman association helen has en fe ld relations had been involved in addressing some aspects of this matter she was not willing to let it be resolved informally or quietly
san di cooper was as signed the case
she would not allow anyone giving deposition to talk about whether the om buds office had been involved at any point
ms lawyer was appalled that san di was in effect ascribing con fid en ti ality to the office when none officially existed
san di persisted in exclusion of any mention of the om buds office
the lawyer words challenged san di and essentially took her to court on this specific issue
the process began at the superior court level
the judge was sympathetic and said in essence that if om buds persons could problem solve informally and help him clear his docket then it was just fine that they be offered confidentiality
the court issued the following statement conclusion does not however render the communications discoverable
in our opinion private institutions have qualified privilege not to disclose communications made before an ombudsman in an attempt to mediate an employee dispute
that qualified privilege is based on constitutional right of privacy
ms lawyer sought to challenge this find ing and the next level to receive this issue was the california court of appeals
they refused to hear or comment on this issue and sent it up to the california supreme court
the supreme court sent it back to appeals with the message that they needed to tackle the issue
in the meantime cal tech now had both their om buds person and general counsel embroiled in case that was working its way up through the california court system
they hired an appeals law firm to help sort out and defend the institute us on this issue
met several times with the lawyers from the hired firm but basically just did my work and give much thought to what was happening
it certainly did not consume much of my time or energy
then one day san di called to tell me that the case was being heard in the angeles court and both of us went to hear the arguments
san di asked me what would do if we lost the case and answered stop at to get my to outfit
she was surprised at that answer and asked me if was serious
the discussion was fascinating but essentially the decision pivoted on the fact that the institute deemed that the om buds office was confidential place that all of the material about the office stated that it was confidential that the cal tech population believed that they would have confidentiality in all discussions with the om buds and therefore they deemed the of fice confidential
part of the appeals decision follows provided by cal tech shows that employees participating in informal media ti ons before its ombudsman do so in the belief that the communications will not be disclosed
cal tech gives to all employees strict pledge of confidentiality and assurance that they may rely on the confidentiality independence and impartiality of the office
while cal tech has formal mechanisms for resolving harassment complaints those members of the cal tech community who elect not to avail themselves of the formal complaint and resolution procedures may utilize the ser vices of the office which was estab lish ed in to the cal tech com mu with confidential informal assistance in resolving intra campus conflicts disputes and grievances in promoting fair and equitable treatment within the institute and in fostering the general wellbeing of the cal tech com mu
been asked many times how felt this impacted the way did business at cal tech and the answer then and now is that did nothing different
nor did feel any sense that might not ever be named in case or subpoenaed in yet another issue
but it certainly allowed all of us to breathe collective sigh of relief
those of you seeking more information about this case should go ogle gar stang vs cal tech and read more of the ruling
it does bring up interesting past cases on which the decision was reached as well as establishing the right to privacy at private institutions
would imagine but know for sure that the criteria applies to public institutions as well
journal of the international ombudsman association helen has en fe ld david miller has asked me to reflect on what the out come of this case means for our profession
during my tenure as an ombudsperson and after there has been an ongoing quest for privilege in our profession
my understanding is that this piece of case law has been used time and time again in the attempt to gain that privilege
although the issue has not been resolved to satisfaction or comfort level will comment on the unusual actions of the admin is tra ti on during this period
believe that large part of trust and their willingness to go to bat for the office was due to the fact that was very col labor at ive person without crossing any of the neutral boundaries that we all adhere to
my past experience had been in community development and my way of doing business was shaped by my former professional life and the environment of the cal tech workplace
for example met regularly with the director of em ploy ee relations about campus staff climate issues
from those meetings came many positive changes within the formal systems at the institute pertaining to staff
in many ways what did was provide upward feedback to her based on the kinds of things that came regularly to the office
for example human re sources chose not to share employee handbooks with each employee
to find out what the rules regulations were an employee had to ask his her boss to see the handbook
everyone felt this was red flag issue and so people came to my office to see the handbook
after short while all employees were provided with their own copies
also was the first office to develop pamphlet where addressed many of the thorny problems inherent in an om buds office such as can trust your confidentiality if you are being paid by the institute
my annual report was posted on the om buds web site
appropriate things were public other appropriate things were very private
did the same with general counsel to smaller extent
however made myself available to institute should they want to do this
worked as much if not more on macro community level than micro individual level
all of this allowed the campus the transparency felt was needed to be trusted by everyone on campus other than the who would have loved to see the earth swallow me in one
what recognized again in this job as had previously was the importance of knowing the climate and culture of the place where you are employed
had walked blindly into this sort of trust relationship probably would have been eaten alive
but over time learned how to work with much of the institute on positive and trusting level and was lucky that had read the environment correctly
ombudsman confidentiality ed is co very standards
of practice electronically stored information digital records record retention do you know where your records are
om buds have worked tirelessly to develop po li that protect confidentiality and minimize if not eliminate any records that might be used to breach confidentiality if they were turned over internally or provided to litigants in any court proceeding
as of fices evolve from an environment when records could be locked up in box and kept relatively secure to world where electronically stored information can be maintained on computers cell phones video recorders thumb drives lap tops tablets printers and scores of similar devices new challenges confront om buds assurances of confidentiality
in addition to storage at an institution technology experts now tout the benefits of working in the cloud where information will be stored on off site servers outside of the physical control of the om buds
thus om buds need to understand the full extent of their records or be lost in cloud of information overload
how does one make sure all records are reasonably secure if the multiplicity of locations where records are produced and stored remains unclear
in addition the exp an sion of has placed demands on the legal system which will also force om buds and their institutions to respond
this article explores the diverse ways an om buds produces electronic records intentionally or without knowledge and offers some preliminary steps to address the electronic innovations that increase the challenges to the om buds best practices
om buds provide safe havens for visitors to explore sensitive issues revolving around conflict brainstorm options to access different conflict resolution strate gies and consider whether to become whistle blow er and the consequences of such action
disclosure of records that reveal identity andor issues undermines om buds in cloud of ex ab yt es the digital rail craig mo us in journal of the international ombudsman association craig mo us in confidence in om buds ability to fulfill their mission
moreover as the profession seeks to convince legis la tors or the courts that public policy supports the establishment of an om buds privilege to not disclose information om buds must show consistent practices and careful control over any documents or records that must be maintained to prevail
in examining these concerns om buds face at least three questions regarding the security of office information
the first concern addresses the scope of the technology relied upon by om buds
om buds must worry not just about securing records but know how when and where records are produced how when and where they may be transmitted how when and where are records stored and how when and where they are preserved and for how long
if records are destroyed how when where and how thoroughly are they destroyed
second concern involves identifying the parties that might want to pierce confidentiality and what steps must be taken to respond to those distinctive en ti ties
in keeping with professional principles om buds seek to keep identities conversations and any notes or memoranda about the visitors confidential from internal constituencies to preserve the trust in the safe haven
once party seeks to litigate against the institution the om buds will face requests from outside the organization and perhaps internally as general counsel may request in forma ti on to assist in any defense of lawsuit
the third concern addresses personal and prof es sion al issue
as technology offers seamless comm uni cation om buds should evaluate how their personal lives interact with their professional lives
cell phones may contain both professional and personal contacts and information
tablets may contain the bestselling novel for leisure reading and the notes from con fi den ti al call
working from home may make one more efficient but what confidentiality questions are raised when one sends em ails or memos from personal home computer to work computer or to others with whom the om buds communicates electronic al ly
social media sometimes connect professional and personal lives as well and raises similar concerns
the international ombudsman association has established standards of practice sop guiding om buds responsibility regarding confidentiality
om buds have sought to minimize or eliminate the pro duc ti on of any records but especially those that might be held on behalf of the institution
to comply with the sops om buds must demonstrate that they have taken all necessary steps to ensure confidentiality regarding the production maintenance and de str uc ti on of records
given the necessity of retaining some information to properly fulfill duties the sops further require that any such information retained be kept secure and protected from inspection by others or deleted pursuant to consistent destruction pr ac tice
securing safeguarding and shredding records remain key to ensuring that an om buds fulfills the sops
these sops were prepared however in time when most records and information were composed on paper
today om buds frequently produce digital records
although simply recorded as ones and zeroes which collectively become unit of information called byte specialists now talk of ex ab yt es of in forma storage to include the information found in one trillion books
fred cates an expert in cy ber security notes data than ever are created and stored in digital form
as stanford law professor kathleen sull ivan has written our biographies are etched in the ones and zeros we leave behind in daily digital transactions
government officials now routinely access data that even exist two decades ago
some estimates suggest that of all information is now stored electronically
in the exceeded ex ab yt es of information
one estimate suggests american business sends trillion em ails each year
wireless text messages exceeded two trillion in one hundred or more em ails day has become standard professional fare
as electronic information has expanded so have breaches of private in forma ti on with over million data records of us citizens breached through security lapses from to electronically stored information thus challenges compliance with sop records are un der the control of the om buds
all in for mat ion stored in an electronic medium including and video files email messages instant mes sag es voice mails web sites word processing documents databases spreadsheets digital photos information created with specialized business or engineering software and backup or archival copies of that same journal of the international ombudsman association craig mo us in information
backup systems archiving systems and computer programs all maintain information that add layers of record retention that did not exist when typewriters produced documents
computers also contain meta data about electro ni cal ly stored files that is hidden in the files themselves
meta data usually includes information such as the creator creation date and dates on which the file was opened read modified or printed
the challenges poses to om buds our own institutions and society are simul ta neo us ly adapting to these changes
we need to be aware of the currents that are channeling those ins ti tut ion al and governmental responses in the tech no logical and legal context as articulates its prof es sion al standards
as national institutes of health ombudsman howard gad lin warned us our prof es sion al were about professional practice standards and there is difference between prof es sion al practice standards and the legal environment in which they operate
developments in the law however will impact om buds practice
the legal en viron ment specifically the influence of ed is co very the search for relevant documents within raises issues that our own institutions must address and simultaneously necessitates response by the om buds profession
litigation in the united states has primarily depended upon discovery of information prior to trial as an essential component of seeking the truth
the legal world however has only recently begun to grasp the extent of how seeking all relevant has changed the landscape of con tempo court proceedings
when multiple employees working with their own computers and tele com mu ni cations devices become involved in case the cost of document retrieval review and production can conceivably run far greater than the potential liability of any one case influencing institutions to consider critical legal decisions based on cost instead of actual liability
thus understanding the evolution of ed is co very litigation may assist om buds work within their own institutions to address confidentiality issues raised by
at the same time observing how other professions adapt to the burgeoning challenges of ed is co very may assist om buds resolve these practice issues
thus an om buds has responsibility to know who has access to all of those records and second must work with general counsel when litigant requests to understand what might be claimed as con fid en ti al and whether an om buds privilege of confidential can be claimed
when legal action is commenced or reasonably anticipated best legal practice calls for the general counsel to issue legal hold letter ordering the recipient to preserve all data subsequent to the receipt of the letter
frequently negotiations will take place to see what must be turned over in the litigation or other legal matter
if reasonable record destruction policy calls for routine shredding of records and the policy is consistently followed there typically would not be duty to produce any record destroyed prior to any anticipated litigation
in forma ti on that was not routinely destroyed pursuant to an established policy may be subject to discovery
for an example of the extent of subject to potential discovery one court has ordered party to provide of or description by category and location of all documents data compilations and tangible things that are in the possession custody or control of the party and that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses
more specifically rule ab disclosures should and cate go to the extent identified during the initial investigation the nature and location of po ten ti ally relevant documents and records including computerized data and other electronically recorded information
data and other electronically recorded information includes but is not limited to voice mail messages and files backup voice mail files email messages and files backup email files deleted em ails data files program files backup and archival tapes temporary files system history files web site information stored in textual graphical or audio format web site log files cache files cookies and other electron ic ally recorded information
furthermore the disclosing party should take steps to ensure that it discloses any backup copies or files or archival tapes that will provide in forma ti on about any electronic data
journal of the international ombudsman association craig mo us in general counsel will work both with the ins ti tu employees to first determine whose may be relevant to the particular case and then normally negotiate with opposing counsel over the scope of discovery subject to the approval
imagine however if only five employees are subject to this discovery order the extent of potential records that must be reviewed
if in the course of subsequent litigation the court determines that one side either failed to produce relevant information or destroyed information that should have been available it can order sanctions against the party failing to comply up to and inc lud ing that the information which was destroyed or failed to be produced should be considered adversely permitting the implication of wrongdoing by the par failing to produce
the overall impact of destroying relevant electronic information comes under the term spoliation which one court defined as de str uc ti on or significant alteration of evidence or failure to preserve property for use as evidence in pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation
that court emphasized the dire effects of spoliation noting perhaps from perjury no act serves to threaten the integrity of the judicial process more than the spoliation of
but when critical documents go missing judges and litigant alike descend into world of ad and half measures and our civil justice system suffers
om buds have longed for legislative and court re cog nit ion of privilege of confidentiality similar to the attorney client privilege
attorney charles howard who has litigated number of cases defending om buds claims to confidentiality has stressed that our practices will be examined closely when we seek the privilege to keep information confidential
the failure to protect records from destruction of even if unintentional because an om buds did not know of all the under his or her control would certainly un der mine claim of consistent practice in accordance with the sops
in addition to the negative con se qu enc es of spoliation moreover the overwhelming amount of information contained in has resulted in inadvertent disclosure of material that might other wise have been protected by privilege
haw ley insurance co fe lm an production inc for example the lawyers for one party disclosed large number of documents that might have been protected by attorney client privilege
when the lawyers requested that the privilege precluded reliance on the do cu men ts at trial the court held in part that because of the large number of disclosures the failure to take reasonable precautions to avoid inadvertent disclosure and the failure to promptly address the issue the party waived the attorney client privilege
because the om buds claim to confidentiality has not yet received the same judicial and legislative pro tec ti on offered under the attorney client privilege equivalent inadvertent disclosure of information an om buds might try to protect would likely lead court to require disclosure of that information
thus even if an om buds persuades court to grant the privilege of confidentiality inadvertent disclosure by an om buds would eliminate the victory by waiving the privilege
the rise of ed is co very raises the bar to require understanding of the size and shape of produced by an om buds office and the care of its retrieval review andor regular destruction prior to litigation being anticipated
understanding the om buds digital tra ila typical om buds day may generate very few traditional paper records but leaves open the ques ti on of whether the om buds has lived up to sops and as seen in the following hypothetical
pre par ing his breakfast certain midwest om buds decides to check his electronic calendar to make sure he is aware of all his appointments for the day proudly noting that the code he has established permits him to know which visitors will arrive that day but anyone looking at his calendar will see nothing but letters and numbers
he recalls that visitor asked to meet outside of the office for confidentiality purposes and he agreed to meet the visitor at local coffee shop
walking the half mile to his train he calls an om buds colleague at west coast state university for some collegial advice
given the time zone differ en ce he calls her cell phone and requests copy of an article his colleague is writing regarding bullying in which he had provided her with some examples of egregious behavior
she em ails him draft of the article
meanwhile realizing that he is late for his first appointment he calls the visitor to inform her of his tardiness
after meeting the visitor at the coffee shop he takes public transit to his office
while on the train he calls his office assistant to check in and confirm his arrival time replies to two em ails and responds to one of the voice messages on his cell phone
le av journal of the international ombudsman association craig mo us in ing the train he walks through campus to his office building
he greets the security guard in his build lobby and reminds the guard that an alumnus who does not have current university id card will be visiting later in the day
arriving at the office he turns on his computer checks em ails and downloads his article on bullying
he forgets about one voice message that he opened on the train but notes that colleague in human resources has sent him confidential attachment
he opens the attach ment but realizing what it is closes and deletes the email and attachment
he then responds asking that nothing be sent by email indicating that he will walk over to her office and read the document in the hr office
he meets one visitor in conference room in faculty office building which requires all entrants to swipe their university id card
one visitor asks him to copy sheet with several phone numbers and contact information for the om buds to call when the visitor is on vacation
as the om buds complies he makes mental note to destroy the sheet of paper once he no longer needs it
he gets an email from face book that concerns him the visitor he met at the coffee shop entered note on her face book page lauding the om buds office for helping her solve conflict
after day with several visitors and many phone con versa ti ons he turns off his computer and heads home to finish an article he is writing for the journal
on the way home he listens to the two voice messages that have been left by two staff members seeking ap pointmen ts but does not immediately delete them so that he will remember to follow up in the morning
af ter dinner he finishes draft of the journal article and em ails it to the editor just after midnight
content with good work secure in the knowledge that he has kept only one written note that is filed securely in locked file cabinet he believes he has lived one more day consistent with the sops
the om buds heads for bed as his cell phone purrs with new mes sages including one from his colleague on the west coast who asks him to delete the draft research paper because she found mistake where she had in ad ver tent ly included information that might disclose the identity of some visitors
as our om buds drifts off one small worry nags him how many records has our well intentioned om buds developed in his one day of work that he must account for under the sops
that small nagging feeling will soon overwhelm him when he realizes the avalanche of information that now is intentionally and sometimes unknowingly kept through his daily work through
although this discussion does not exhaust all the po ten ti al records there is little doubt that this hypo the ti cal produced an extensive digital trail
each time an electronic device was opened the om buds produced an electronic record and meta data chain of in for mat ion regarding the activity itself
voice messages are frequently digitized and perhaps replicated in an email system so that information has left digital trail and when not deleted prior to normal back up policies becomes second set of records in the back up files
the om buds should work closely with team within the institution to determine the best methods for seeking the greatest protection for confidentiality
working with the document retention and destruction policy with added safeguards for increased confidentiality of om buds material should be an early step
courts will examine if regular de struction policies are followed when no litigation is reasonably anticipated
the om buds should be aware of his or her back up policy if any for electronic communications
om buds should consider deleting all electronic messages before back up oc curs
deleting em ails and voice mails prior to back up on consistent basis can also show good faith efforts to maintain confidentiality
care should be taken however knowing that deleting destroys neither the message nor the meta data
computer forensic experts can retrieve data that has been deleted unless additional wiping or destroying the hard drive itself eliminates the
deleting reduces the number of records maintained by the om buds but does not de lete all records
encryption programs may be utilized to protect from internal review or outside hackers but encryption still leaves and they may have to be unencrypted if they are left on hard drives or in archives prior to the anticipation of litigation
when computers or cell phones are replaced care needs to be taken that the original hard drives or sim cards are properly disposed of to prevent out sid ers from obtaining information that is retrievable by forensic experts
did the om buds check his electronic calendar on his cell phone or home computer
even if code de scribes the appointments has the om buds recorded the code and its keys on written document prepared by computer
the om buds needs to know that just checking his calendar produces additional meta data journal of the international ombudsman association craig mou sinon those separate devices leaving record that might identify the visitor
recall that meta data includes information that is stored on any computer every time computer is turned on and file opened
cell phones especially smart phones present par ticul ar problems
the ease of use and ubiquity of cell phones have led people to not use passwords for the phones themselves or the voice messages left on cell phones
technique known as id spoofing can enable another phone to disguise their phone and access voice mails
if passwords are not employed the om buds places all his information at risk of possible theft
moreover cell phones leave digital trail as they seek out cell towers leaving trail corresponding with the actual om buds journey which can identify the location where the om buds met his visitor at the coffee shop
when combined with the record of the calls it could lead to the identity of the visitor
smart phones offer backup availability to the cloud server not owned by the om buds or the institution but one where the om buds information is stored until needed by the om buds
third parties may have access to that information through court ordered subpoenas or by hacking
relying on servers in the cloud may be the way of the future but it places the responsibility on the om buds to reasonably know how to protect the confidential of the information stored in the cloud
cell phones should be password protected with the ability to wipe out information if stolen or lost
as smart phones lead to millions of new ap ps om buds should investigate whether new app opens security concerns to their personal information
one app that advertised as full service for owners with the bonus of encryption did not encrypt the meta data which included the file name
thus an unsuspecting om buds might innocently place file name that provided id en ti fica ti on which would not be protected under the ap ps encryption promises
tablets raise many of the same confidentiality problems
modern copiers and printers often include chip that digitizes all copies made on machine
the om buds should use copy machine or printer that does not have that option or at least know that destroying the sheet of paper that had vacation phone numbers will not eliminate the record if the machine still has digital record of the paper
when the om buds stopped at the security desk did video camera record his image or the image of the alumnus visitor later that day
if so what is the ins ti tu policy on maintaining and destroying the video recording
likewise the om buds and visitor both swiped id cards to meet at the faculty office ne ce ssi tat ing that the om buds know the retention policy on tracking entries into university buildings
the consequences of social media and confidential have just begun to be investigated
use of social media may explicitly reveal comm uni ca ti on with the om buds but if privacy controls are not properly managed may also disclose meeting loca ti ons and make more information public than either the om buds or visitor would desire
has already begun to discuss the use of social media and om buds practices
use of the cell phone authoring the journal article at home and receiving the email from the west coast colleague all left digital trail on multiple devices
depending upon what the om buds worked on with home computer or what em ails might be sent or received from personal email account the om buds may have discoverable material and therefore general counsel might put legal hold on the home computer
although it is less likely that litigant could demand that third party such as the west coast om buds have her computer reviewed by forensics expert at least one court has ordered forensic review of home computer to see if an email sent by the nonparty to one of the litigants could be used as evidence in the trial
this daily routine of an om buds production of does not intend to frighten us into paralysis or back to the quill pen days when the unique paper record could be shredded to ensure confidentiality
with the size of some of our institutions electronic com munic ati on may be the only way to permit access for some of our visitors
moreover if history is any guide most om buds will not be party to lawsuit or subject to discovery
under the sops however the om buds still has duty to understand what records are under control of the om buds office
the intent moreover is to look for ways to encourage access and comm uni ca ti on with maximum protection and control
indeed the om buds profession may have been few steps ahead of others in understanding the complexity of journal of the international ombudsman association craig mo us in confidentiality and electronic communication
professional training has long emphasized the imp or tan ce of alerting visitors to the possible breaches to confidentiality through the use of email
just recently however the american bar association released new formal opinion regarding an duty to warn client that if the client uses company owned electronic communication device there is sig ni fi cant risk that the communications will be read by the employer or third party
if such policy exists attorneys should warn their clients that all em ails sent or received through the computers cell phones or telecommunications devices are subject to employer review and therefore face the potential that the attorney client privilege would be un avail able to protect the communication from serving as evidence in litigation
steps to protect electronically stored information given the scope of the following sugg es ti ons may help all om buds sleep better at night
first develop team approach with your information ser vices staff is your document retention and de str uc ti on policy staff and your general office to anticipate issues and seek resolution
work with your is team to understand the many different ways you produce digital record of your daily activities and what steps you can take to minimize unauthorized access as well as complete destruction of data as routine course of business
continue your education about how technology creeps into normal om buds practices and how one can encourage access without breaching confidentiality
invite your is team to find computer programs or ap ps that enhance security and organize the
explore encryption programs that permit ease of communication
follow the spirit of sop to use technology to secure all produced by the office and enable efficient and effective review of if the office receives legal hold letter
know your document retention and destruction policy and in communication with your staff enhance it to meet the particular requirements of the sops
follow your do cu ment retention and destruction policy consistently to preclude any question that document destruction was done because of litigation rather than as part of the normal practice
smart phones and tablets are easily lost or stolen
ensure that information is encrypted use passwords both for the device and for voice mails to avoid the spoofing problem
investigate and add effective malwa re protection specifically for your smart phone
you may also download ap ps to block or wipe clean your smart phone if it falls into the wrong hands
make plans to cover such possibilities knowing that human error remains one of the most vulnerable elements of computer security
compare notes with colleagues in other professions such as health care the law and government who face similar issues
the international legal technology standards organization was recently established at the american bar tech show and it has started to list standards for attorneys while seeking feedback from the profession
several state bar associations have made it clear that attorneys have duty to continue to educate themselves on the issues raised by new technologies
one scholar suggests that an attorney who litigates today and does not understand meta data commits malpractice
the seventh circuit court of appeals has instituted trial program for attorneys to understand the challenges of ed is co very
its final point tellingly establishes duty of continuous education regarding ed is co very
the state bar of arizona includes within its prof es sion al responsibility rules the following caveat particular system provides reason able protective measures must be by the technology reasonably available at the time to secure data against unintentional disclosure
as technology advances oc cur lawyers should periodically review security measures in place to ensure that they still rea son ably protect the security and confidentiality of the documents and information
the arizona bar further emphasized the duty of at tor ne ys to their own competence limitations regarding computer security measures and take the necessary time and energy to become competent or alternatively consult available experts in the field
om buds should have no less standard of reason ableness
might consider gathering interested om buds to explore how om buds can best work with new technologies with integrity to our mission and continue to educate om buds regarding the use of electronic devices
the author is member of the legal and legislative affairs committee which is cur journal of the international ombudsman association craig mo us in rent ly reviewing all sops
the committee welcomes your ideas for ways to help all om buds enhance communication while maintaining protection of their data
we live in time when the tsunami brings both blessings and curses
we can use the technology to assist our mission of assisting resolution of conflict and build more peaceful world
at the same time we can be so overwhelmed with the onslaught of and in our lives that we fear paralysis from attempting to leave no trail of records
the courts have begun to recognize the overwhelming costs and burdens associated with ed is co very
they have sought proportionality and intentional co opera ti on between competing parties in the midst of liti ga ti on to preserve the ability to find the truth in difficult controversies and limit the cost of reviewing of information to find that one email that sheds light on liability
not surprisingly seeking co operative and peaceful resolution of conflict defines om buds work
through collaboration with is staff document retention and destruction staff and general office om buds seek similar goal and bring new level of security to the records we produce in our work
at the same time the expansion may call for review of the scope of om buds confidentiality
the profession may want to explore proportionality in terms of balancing access and working in partnership with institution and visitors to clearly express what can be kept fully confidential and what can be reasonably protected
at the very least may con sider expanding the language we use to inform our visitors about the confidentiality consequences of
we can bring our resources to bear and exploit the new technologies without betraying our principles
otherwise if we hide our head in the cloud we run the risk of disclosing far more information than we ever dreamed we possessed in the midst of all those and zeroes
two other additional groups may seek access to om buds information
hackers malicious or otherwise may troll the data from om buds seeking confidential information or passwords that unlock other information
finally federal or local law enforcement may seek information or hacking by foreign governments may test the protection of an
these two additional areas also need to be examined but are beyond the scope of this article
nonetheless some of the steps taken to safeguard discussed in this article may also protect against these other risks

my az bar org ethics opinion view
before all else convey my deep gratitude to the steadfast yet warm tenacity of david miller who think is quite remarkable
and to my dear colleague in new york who always takes the time to give me honest and critical feedback
introduct ioni still remember that evening years ago walking to class going over the reading assignments in my head with my shoulders leaning forward to bear the weight of the books in my backpack when my stride was suddenly interrupted by talking to you you affirmative action bitch
also remember the relief of being able to speak with someone trusted in confidence
nothing was more comforting than knowing had way to privately explore and evaluate the situation before making decision on how to address it or whether to address it at all
years later as an ombudsman practicing under the standards of practice and code of ethics of the international ombudsman assoc ia ti on different scenario raises questions
what if for example were trying to confidentially inform visitor there was nothing more could do on their matter within my role as ombudsman and the visitor shouted similar utterances
certainly have an interest in being free from gender racial and verbal harassment and in exploring viable options to address the situation in way that is fair
however how can begin to do this if out of duty to provide the visitor with confidentiality could not identify the visitor or the content of our communications
and if confidentiality would not allow me to raise the issue then it is no surprise that there is insufficient clarity re gard ing the process by which could securely explore options for resolution
there is gap in guidance therefore from the prof es sion regarding how to recognize and protect the interests as an individual family and community member and as professional who is still subject to organizational cultures and environments despite functional independence for his or her role
as people we too have underlying interests such can we talk
confidentiality and the ombudsman as an individual in duma ti sen journal of the international ombudsman association in duma ti sen as respect equality job security reputation career advancement and other needs to meet
ironically the types of interests we as ombudsmen try to assist ers to meet through fair and informal dispute re so lu ti on we are ignoring for ourselves
confidentiality serves fundamental purpose and is of utmost importance in the effectiveness of our work to say the least
the code standards and best practices provide clarity on the essential needs of the function including on confidentiality
however they do not necessarily provide much emphasis or guidance on the needs of the individual fulfilling the function such as for fairness
in fact the breadth of confidentiality without discussion of how pr ac titi oner may raise his or her own concerns can be perceived as an impediment to fair opportunity to understand and resolve conflicts that arise out of confidential communications
my goal is to reaffirm the vital nature of confidential but also delve deeper into conversations we need to have about ombudsmen as individuals
specifically the dilemma an ombudsman may face in wanting to guard confidentiality of communications but also needing to safely raise issues out of confidential environment that may not necessarily rise to the level of an exception or risk of serious harm
one idea for bridging the gap and reaching balance lies within realm where ombudsmen already have expertise informal dispute resolution
the office of the ombudsman and its staff the host or ga ni zati on and constituencies the office serves could consider informal dispute resolution processes to help resolve issues arising out of the office including from the interaction with visitors or the organization
well known processes such as ne got ia ti on organizational and mediation would help transition an issue from one confidential setting to another while enabling the ombudsman or visitor or the organization for that matter to raise issues that would normally lack clarity in whether and how they may be raised
the profession through the best practices could be strong source of sup port for such an opportunity
balancing interests of the profession and the practitioner rather than introducing or examining an ex cep ti on to confidentiality this piece revolves around recognizing the critical and central role confidentiality plays yet acknowledging and recognizing the needs of practitioners as individuals
after all individuals are part of collectives with various attachments to id en and real world obligations
impartiality and other aspects of our role do not wash those aspects of our individual and group identities away
in fact propose that profession that advocates for fairness and eq ui should also remember the individual who breathes air into the role of the ombudsman and ensure that its practitioners are able to adequately address their own concerns and interests in fair and equitable manner
such recognition and support can only serve to strengthen our independence and impartiality and positively impact our practice and profession
let us look at confidentiality and interests through hypothetical scenario
is of central asian background young single woman and newer ombudsman with limited net work of colleagues
she is passionate about om buds and has finally been able to get position with an organization after searching for employment in the ombudsman field for almost year following eral years of graduate school and incurring student loan debt
she is proudly traditional and is the sole provider for herself and her widowed mother who is prominent in her community and is helping to ar range marriage for her daughter
and her mother are immigrants who live in the united states
is certified organizational ombudsman pr act it io and is the sole practitioner for an office that follows the standards and code
is working with top manager and rising star in the org ani zati on to help resolve an issue with assistant
knowing the conversation will be confidential makes comparisons between his body and while staring at breasts
as he leaves he makes further sexual comments about body and sex appeal making feel extremely vuln er able and angry
journal of the international ombudsman association in duma ti sen in looking at some of the issues involved in the above scenario sexual harassment is clearly one that jumps out
there are also potentially ethnicity based and gender related issues among others
in this particular scenario there is also an abuse of power within the confidential setting of the office
the question is how could or should proceed and according to whose terms
protection of confidentiality as core and shared interest first let us look at confidentiality from the organizational ombudsman perspective
under the code and standards cannot dis close any part of the conversation with unless there is an imminent risk of serious harm or without express permission
the standards provide that as the ombudsman all communications with those seeking assistance in strict confidence and takes all reasonable steps to safeguard also includes the following requirement by the ombudsman does not reveal and must not be required to reveal the identity of any individual contacting the ombudsman office nor does the ombudsman reveal information provided in confidence that could lead to the identification of any individual contacting the ombudsman office without that express permission given in the course of informal discussions with the ombudsman the ombudsman takes specific action related to an issue only with the ex press permission and only to the extent permit ted and even then at the sole discretion of the ombudsman unless such action can be taken in way that safeguards the identity of the in di vidual contacting the ombudsman as practitioner is bound by con fid en ti ality and cannot raise the sexual harassment or other issues based on the communications with from their session
this is true even if she withdraws from the matter as she should do in this case since impartiality cannot be maintained along with other reasons
as coop raising the issue in way that may become public may even open her up to being by the board of certification which states in its ethics complaints procedure that professionals who violate the code of ethics or the standards of practice or engage in other unprofessional conduct as defined in section hereof are subject to prescribed disciplinary procedures and sanctions set forth in this document
seems like win lose situation at first glimpse as we have view of as an individual and the circum stances behind the event
however it is important to remember that the organizational ombudsman field has fundamental interest in protecting con fi den ti ality as core principle of the function as well
confidentiality has evolved to become central characteristic for the organizational ombudsman profession practitioner visitor and the organization committed to an effective ombudsman programme
as the profession was developing in the united states and although the american bar association aba resolution did not mention confidentiality as an essential characteristic by the time of the aba resolution consensus had developed that the essential characteristics of an om buds and those of an organizational program in must include confidentiality
the influence of mediation and other alternative methods of dispute resolution on the inclusion of confidentiality in the evolution of the organizational ombudsman are mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution confidentiality had long been seen as critical element of the process because only with the assurance of con fid en ti ality will the parties reveal their real concerns and goals
the mediator privy to the claims and hopes of both sides can then begin to try to find common ground or means to resolve the dispute
because so much of what org ani za ti on al om buds now do closely resembles this type of mediation application of similar process confidentiality to organizational om buds was natural development
the adoption of confidentiality in the standards and code the organizational ombudsman profession has identified an essential element for the function and effectiveness of the role which also complements and supports the elements of inde pen den ce impartiality and informality
indeed con fi den ti ality helps define the function and the nature of the services so much so that even though the ombudsman is the one who asserts the confidentiality privilege it is shared interest and understanding between visitor organization prof es sion and practitioner
journal of the international ombudsman association in duma ti sen the reason that confidentiality is so important is that it works to establish trust and is stabilizing factor in an unstable conflict ridden environment
con fid en ti ality directly helps protect the visitor by enabling an environment and process for sensitive discussions to take place and keeping sensitive information such as identity safe from disclosure
for organizations con fid en ti ality allows certain concerns to be raised that would not have been raised otherwise and promotes the improvement of organizational health
con fid en ti ality critical to making the ombudsman office place where people can raise any issue including an alleged violation of statute regulation rule policy or ethical standard
the point where there is gap forming between the professional principle of confidentiality and ability to raise the issues is partly the breadth of confidential under the standards without providing for the recognition and accommodation for need to be able to talk about what took place during the con fi den ti al session and understand what options there may be to try to address the matter if she wishes to do so
according to the standards the ombudsman asserts confidentiality privilege does not testify and resists testifying in formal process keeps no identifying records protects confidential information from disclosure and inspection and does not serve as source for receiving or normally giving notice to the organization
and as the code mentions the exception to confidentiality is imminent risk of serious harm the best practice for which be to limit any such disclosure to only that needed to prevent or warn of imminent and potentially serious harm
thus the profession endorses limited and narrow exception to confidentiality
this creates source of conflict between needs and her professional duty towards confidentiality
protection of the individual contacting the office is paramount under the standards and the breadth of what is confidential is therefore vast
within this vastness however appears the gap for fairly re cog ni zing the needs and interests that may emerge for the ombudsman
that is within communications that are considered confidential under the standards there may be instances where the ombudsman feels unfairly treated abused or targeted but has no clear avenue to raise such issues without offending prof es sion al norms
earthly needs and interests the ombudsman as an individual not too long ago there was an intriguing dialogue among members about confidential that started with question on the list serv
at the core of that passionate discussion was the issue of at what point in practice should would we divulge information in order to protect our own interests
there seemed to be some conflict between the ideas of when we versus when we actually might
thoughts and responses on and offline varied from not divulging anything unless the exception of imminent risk of serious harm applied and strongly re sisting any external formal process to complying with subpoenas and court orders to highlighting that our role as ombudsmen is source of livelihood on which we may depend and to acknowledging that our reputation and careers are important to us
the dis cuss ion danced around the issue of the core interest of confidentiality and the potential conflict it could generate if our own needs interests and rights were at stake
it was discussion that included spectrum of ombudsman perspectives with one point of the spectrum focused on guarding confidentiality against all odds and the other determining that at the end of the day is just job
individuals have interests that need to be met through fair processes and agreements and if unmet can lead to conflict no one understands this in practice better than the ombudsman who id en ti fi es the organization and the interests on regular basis to develop options for resolution to conflicts that surface
although the ombudsman ti on requires observation of strict confidentiality less exception and impartiality an individual with life story fills the role of the ombudsman
we can see as an ombudsman but hopefully also as whole person
her interests include the need for respect equality dignity and harassment and retaliation free environment
it is also within her inter est to be treated with fairness have clarity of options be empowered continue her livelihood and career and be able to continue to observe professional standards
we have view of her ties to identity to community obligations and priorities that make her person as well as an ombudsman and she has an journal of the international ombudsman association in duma ti sen interest in protecting those
it is natural for to con sider how her financial situation would be affected if she chose to leave her position at the organization or how the signs of unrest in her role with the org ani za ti on may reflect on her career or within her tightknit community
we can go further to imagine the impact sexual harassment claims may have if somehow pub li cal ly available on mother sense of self within her community the flourishing of gossip humiliation etc
furthermore if she found no other way to address the issue and eventually left her position how would perception of the ombudsman profession change
turning to how may address the issues the follow ing options arise under the standards
first withdraw al from the matter is appropriate because actual andor perception of impartiality has been affected
after withdrawal will be out of the specific case with but it really does not address the issues that arose and leaves open the possibility of future abuse
she can try to address the issues directly with andor if she has access to independent legal counsel she may be consult with counsel on next steps
address ing the issue directly with can also be problematic as it could escalate and there is very real political power imbalance in the relationship dynamic
access to independent legal counsel instead of the or ga counsel would be appropriate to protect confidentiality
however such access could very much depend on whether there is an understanding be tween the organization and the office and if so what the specific understanding regarding independent counsel is
if is an employee of the organization she could also theoretically go to boss her own reporting line human resources or the compliance office for sexual harassment to raise the concern via the applicable policy but any real complaint would identify the above options also run the danger of isolating the issues to sexual harassment without the opportunity for more discussion on other specific or broader issues such as power and relationship and abuse of the ombudsman context within which the incident took place
alternatively if the exception of risk of serious applied could disclose the problem without fear of violating the code or standards
however as previously discussed this exception is intended to be narrowly interpreted
as another op ti on could possibly disclose and place the org ani za ti on on notice if there is procedure to do so in her role but such disclosure could violate confidentiality under standard and
may also violate stan dard if the matter leads to formal process she has to be involved in as an informal channel
the other options include not doing anything leaving the job or seeking assistance from legal counsel or possibly an administrative body external to the organization if available and accessible
however although there may seem to be myriad of options given the con fi den ti al impartial independent and informal nature of our role the path for decision making is not so clear
guided by the same interest and need based phi lo so phies alternative dispute resolution prof es sion als including organizational ombudsmen so often apply toward clients and visitors the question arises whether the above options will adequately meet and uphold needs and interests inc lud ing having an avenue or range of avenues to raise the issues that concern her
in practical terms it is important to picture what may be weighing disclosure and pursuing the protection of her own legitimate interests vs
protecting confidentiality and the sanctity of the profession as she has learned it
it is not an easy choice and may even be left without person with whom she can consult
ultimately may find that in practice the very role that helps others to raise concerns and advocates for fairness and equity may be confining her in being able to raise her own concerns understand her options better and seek fair resolution
she is not just without an ombudsman for herself but confidentiality makes it unclear how she may consult third party in the first place
if the code and standards did not intend for this gap to ex ist then the best practices can help by providing guidance and bridging it
guidance under the best practices currently the best practices provides the following regarding the subject of retaliation something the ombudsman and the office should be guarded ombudsman should be protected from re taliation such as elimination of the office of the ombudsman or reduction of the ombudsman budget or other resources by any person who may be the subject of complaint or inquiry
of the international ombudsman association in duma ti sen although the language seems to protect the pr ac titi oner as well as the office the examples that are provided relate more to retaliatory actions against and effects on the office rather than on how the practitioner is affected
it is also limited to and does not touch on other forms of potential harms for the practitioner such as harassment or abuse
the language also falls short of providing guidance on how to protect or resolve such issues if they come up
best practices address the issue of process and for the ombudsman and it is re com mended that processes for ombudsman should be addressed in the charter or terms of reference of the office
however this is geared towards the discipline and removal of the ombudsman from office rather than if the ombudsman had to raise an issue
if the language could be broadened to include any or other issues arising out of the ombudsman function rather than only discipline and removal the fair process in the charter could then extend to apply in instances the ombudsman needed to raise an issue herself
let us take consider another hypothetical situation
is university ombudsman who advised con fi den ti ally on matter relating to relationship with her manager
in turn shared information with her manager that was partially true but largely false and identified as the source of the false advice to justify her actions that had gravely violated an org ani za ti on al policy
the manager took the matter to human resources which turned to the chancellor to speak to the ombudsman regarding the particular situation
meanwhile filed complaint against the om buds man using the formal complaint process for misconduct
there is an office charter but nothing in the charter specifies how complaint against the ombudsman may be resolved
realities of desperate economy the responsibilities of raising family supporting mortgage and other financial obligations and professional advancement may raise themselves as issues and interests for is middle aged man who identifies himself as father of young children husband donor to his church and middle class professional who loves his job and is actively involved in the profession
here faces formal complaint procedure as well as inquiries and pressure from senior leadership
as did may also feel strongly about protecting con fi den ti ality and not participating in formal process and at the same time feel conflicted given his own need to defend himself
on the one hand deciding not to defend against the claims may mean the loss of his job damage to his reputation and his career humiliation financial stress among other real life consequences
on the other hand defending himself might mean he discloses information that would be considered to be confidential under the standards and code
in the absence of risk of seri there is doubt that would be able to defend himself without offending the confidentiality standards
absent process and procedural guid an ce through his charter or best practices also has to decide whether he will participate in the formal process of the organization which may further violate the standards and code
however this may allow him the forum to defend himself and his interests
and what if is released from his position for not participating in the formal complaint process not providing confidential information to the chancellor or no reason at all to what options would that road lead
if released from his position will also have to consider how our profession now views is shadow over what happened in the employ ment relationship with the organization even if he stood up for confidentiality
these are all difficult questions the breadth of which is beyond the scope of this paper but raise real con about how as practitioners we can maintain the balance between legitimate self interests and confidentiality
while the critical nature of con fid en ti ality in the organizational function is highlighted it should also be acknowledged that practitioners could find themselves feeling unfairly cornered by the breadth of confidentiality without adequate avenues that address their needs
con fid en ti ality in effect may become barrier to the opp or tu to weigh options on how to address an issue fair process and outcome for the ombudsman
for ex ample if should not go through the organizational formal complaint process then the best practices should provide guidance on what alternatives should be considered by the organization and the office
in sum best practices would be an important start ing point for providing guidance on whether the om buds man may raise and address issues that may harm them as practitioners and individuals on the types of processes that could address such issues and on how the organization and the office might negotiate language regarding the same on charter or terms of reference
journal of the international ombudsman association in duma ti sen allowing space for discourse the vital role of confidentiality and the reality of human interests both exist and may create tension if certain ingredients exist
the question now turns to how we can openly talk about this tension and under stand what options there may be to bridge the gap between the profession and the practitioner
in many ways the ombudsman is like the community mediator who although impartial and independent has relationships within cultural and communal set ting with the constituencies with one major dist inc ti on the hovering organization
the constant pres en ce of the organization as an employer manage ment as decision makers the power to criticize and heal and organizational politics and memory all help create fragile dynamic and code pendency ripe for conflict and retaliation against the ombudsman
this makes it all the more imperative that we recognize the need for clarity in what options and processes may be available for the ombudsman in difficult situations like those of and bit is also worth noting the burden we can sometimes place on one another as colleagues who are third parties and advocates of
the idea of neutrality sometimes carries the danger of imposing the notion that we should be clean slates without associations bonds or identity in order to reach higher level of neutral consciousness without such attachments
similar tendency applies with the idea of the need for which although may be well intentioned can work to suppress necessary dialogue expressions of civil disobedience and conflict if de fined too broadly or attempting to regulate conduct
can also carry with it different negative connotations and historical contexts for individuals and groups
although in our field we are growingly diverse group of people from around the world who enc our age fairness and equity in the treatment of parties in disputes the quest for perfection in neutrality and civility can hinder much needed celebrations and sometimes uncomfortable conversations about our own identities and needs
to be impartial it is imp or ta nt to be able to discuss freely what makes us partial
for example we could benefit from more and on go ing discourse about the elements of our lives such as religion national or regional identity race gender age socioeconomic status political affiliations and other factors that help define who we are as in divi du als and groups
it is also healthy for an inclusive pro fess ion such as ours to have deeper discussion on topics that its practitioners are not immune to such as how we ourselves are affected by white privilege colonial or postcolonial identity immigration ed uca ti on sexual identity poverty and other social barriers war and disasters and other difficult conversations that may be pertinent to how we measure our needs and interests
such ongoing conversations will help us in ing what our interests are as individuals and prof es sion als who practice under common set of stan dar ds
it would also help the profession understand where there are gaps between professional guidance and practitioners from around the globe and how it may help bridge those gaps
the lack of discourse on the other hand can be disservice as it fails to recognize the challenges and enrichment diversity of interests can bring within our own practice and profession and we may not be well prepared to tackle difficulties that arise
as profession we should be better prepared to engage on topic such the and sexualization of gender and cultural identity
or what the balance is between self interest and impartiality for example does heavy financial dependence on the university make him less impartial and more vulnerable to disclosing con fid en ti al information
while it is true that as third parties in case we are serving in we are not the first or second party dis pu tan ts it is also true that we are certainly not humanly above them or shielded from conflict ourselves
carry ing the burden of either trying to be or be perceived as immune to conflict also carries the danger of shift ing to perception of ourselves as immune to process and from accountability
this can be hurdle in the relationship with our host organization especially given the breadth of our desired confidentiality and independence from organizational structures and processes
howard gad lin offered the following thoughts on racial conflict on campus as the outgoing president of the former university and college ombudsmen as sociation on april
there is need for racial conflict racial differences distrust hostilities and suspicions exist and need to be voiced not suppressed
but they need to be voiced in such way and in context that keeps them from be com journal of the international ombudsman association in duma ti sen ing destructive and vicious
the idea behind conflict resolution and mediation is that conflict is natural inevitable and acceptable part of life
the role of mediation and other forms of conflict resolution is to allow conflict to occur in ways that are not destructive
context of speech related to racial harass ment policies and similar harassment policies on university campuses but the core message also in vo lv es process and making genuine effort to engage conflict in constructive ways rather than suppress ing the flow of conflict which may need to surface
take the liberty to apply this to our own professional context in recognition that our independent impar ti al and conflict resolution expert status do not make us conflict resistant or harassment proof nor does it free us from misunderstandings or unfair treatment
in fact our unique claim of independence our veil of confidentiality and our sometimes dubious relation ships with organizations and their leaders make us all the more vulnerable
eloquent discussion of the need for surfacing conflict providing constructive space and the role of mediation helps transition to the issue of what processes the profession may wish to encourage in order to protect confidentiality and sup port practitioners in raising issues when necessary
informal dispute resolution and options for the ombudsman as hg pointed out informal forms of conflict resolution can allow conflict to occur in ways that are not destructive
as ombudsmen we are continuously tapping into processes that can create outcome through fair trustworthy and collaborative communication for visitors
in addition the practice of organizational ombudsmen under the standards including the incorporation of confidentiality as key component is closely intertwined with the compo of mediation
the organizational ombudsman profession can better utilize informal conflict resolution for its own process needs namely to allow concerns that affect pr act it io ne rs to be raised and defend their interests but in confidential setting
best practices should recognize interests more clearly and provide that office charters can include dispute resolution sec ti on
this dispute resolution section would serve as guide for the organization visitors and the office on how issues may be addressed by the ombudsman if they arise in the course of confidential casework
this could create an opportunity for confidentiality of the underlying matter to be maintained and the new layer of issues to be raised and managed by the ombudsman experiencing the conflict
essentially we would be putting into practice for ourselves what we have been doing for others
trust in the om buds man resource could still be maintained while allowing reasonable outlets for the ombudsman should the need arise
as practitioners already know informal dispute resolution carries with it the beauty of flexibility to match the needs of those who use it
in this case the organization and the office can tailor an agreement on dispute resolution to fit their needs including tackling the issue of how to preserve voluntariness of informal dispute resolution while making it the preferred path for conflict resolution involving the office
the process of negotiation and involvement of the organization and constituents in approving and implementing the dispute resolution section could be powerful in gaining buy in and to ensure input and collaborative process from the very beginning
in ad dition it would gain broader recognition that informal dispute resolution options allow multiple interests to be served for multiple parties the visitor org ani za ti on the ombudsman our profession and the om buds man practitioner by protecting the con fid en ti ality of underlying matters providing private and fair environment in which the ombudsman could raise and resolve issues for at least some issues gaining more assurance about staying out of formal processes and creating clear expectations regard ing what process the ombudsman can rely upon and fall under if an issue arises
the following are examples of options and the inter es ts they access to external ombudsman as ombudsmen and are without con fid en ti al informal independent and impartial advisors of their own
when problems first arise and if the ombudsman needs to consult discuss and explore options confidentially she could have access to an external ombudsman to advise him or her
this op ti on as we know allows an opportunity to be heard journal of the international ombudsman association in duma ti sen and the beginning of dialogue
the ombudsman can receive coaching on negotiation from third party neutral and help with evaluating the conflict si tua ti on with issue and interest identification and an aly sis as well as with the generation of options
if agreed to by the other individual involved in the conflict shuttle diplomacy may be valuable tool in reach ing an understanding in conflict
imagine having access to an external ombudsman who then was able to confidentially relay concerns to and help reach an understanding that remained informal and confidential
communications remain confidential thereby protecting the interests of confidentiality in the underlying matter
such an option could be pro for in the charter or terms of reference similar to making provision for independent counsel and can be discussed with visitors openly
negotiation another helpful option that can be expressly provided for and encouraged is negotiation
the individuals involved that is the ombudsman and the person with whom he or she is in conflict may wish to negotiate resolution directly between them selves and come to an understanding informally and privately
negotiation involves process of comm uni cation that allows those in conflict to be able to plan for and work towards resolution and allows space for cyclical process with repetitive exchange of information between the parties its assessment and the resulting adjustments of expectations and prefer enc es there is also development process involved in the movement from the initiation of the dispute to its conclusion some outcome and its imp le men tat ion
negotiation process allows the flow of direct communication the exchange of perspectives and information and getting on the same page towards resolution
there is potential for the healing of the relationship
however direct communication and negotiation may not be possible in all cases
for ex ample may feel uncomfortable raising the issues that resulted from her interaction directly with how ever it may be useful for communication with the chancellor he may communicate directly with the chancellor on the issues anyway but having clear framework to work within may help ensuring privacy security and be conducive to non adversarial ap proach
as with the external ombudsman option the process for negotiation could be clearly laid out in the charter
media ti ona natural familiar and related option to explore is mediation where there is more active intervention by an impartial third party and the process may be more structured and guided to point where the mediator may make proposal for agreement to help resolve the conflict
the mediation process also main tains all that is sacred to the ombudsman con fid en ti ality informal process independence and impartiality of the third party
the mediation process also creates common theatre for the actors to share their stories more closely and empowers them to determine their fate in resolving the matter
there remains hope that relationships will survive
thus if and were able to engage in mediation perhaps would be able to at least voice her concerns and the conversation could lead to positive outcome such as acknowledgment an apology and practical remedies consistent with the values of the organization such taking course on sexual harassment for etc
there are questions regarding if there is an agreement reached through mediation whether it should be signed by the ombudsman who is now party and if so where it should be housed
however these are not completely unfamiliar questions by any means since many ombudsmen who mediate have raised these record keeping related questions that would need further consideration
other questions to think through include whether the organization should receive copy of any written agreement as the employer what rules for mediation would apply and whether financial settlements can be reached through the process against the office
however if the kinks are worked out it could create an opportunity to surface conflicts let them take constructive course and learn from the experience
for instance mediation between and the university could lead to discussion and creativity about the miss ing elements of the ombudsman programme such as amending the charter to include specific and fair process for complaining against the ombudsman or how the organization will support the office in the future to protect confidentiality
journal of the international ombudsman association in duma ti final and binding arbitration if applicable final and arbitration may be an alternative to going to court on issues and maintain ing confidentiality even though the process is more adversarial
it is more determinative and formal process than mediation or consulting with an exter ombudsman and it can be costly
however if the issue can be arbitrated it could allow the parties to be heard in private setting hire subject matter expert as an arbitrator and reach an outcome through third party determination
this option may be especially interesting for international organizations because of the proliferation of the usage and understanding of international arbitration
issues regarding arbitration may include whether there will be legal representation for disputants the rules for procedure cost among other issues
the most difficult step for practitioners and the profession here may be as it is for me to agree to the possibility of an adversarial process
however for certain issues it is worth weighing against going to court
regardless of what type of option is used the pro fess ion and practitioner would have to be vigilant and carefully examine how confidentiality would be guarded through such options especially from the organization if it is not privy to the confidential com munic at ions the ombudsman needs to protect
other complex issues may arise as well such as negotiating and providing clarity on collective bargaining agree men ts regarding represented employee participation in alternative processes with the office
furthermore whether and how the issue of giving or receiving is affected by using alternative dispute resolution should also be examined
thus implementation and protocol would also need careful consideration and discussion
clarity and security regarding process could also serve to deter retaliation against the ombudsman or office by organizational actors and help strengthen our role as impartial third parties because such deterrence would relieve some of the burden
just as we may encounter the need to access independent counsel we may encounter instances when we need access to clear fair confidential and informal process as practitioners
although this paper focuses on conflict for the ombudsman practitioner out of the con fid en ti al setting as profession we may wish to explore the broader role informal dispute resolution can play if applied to the greater organizational ombudsman context
for example we should consider whether informal dispute resolution mechanisms may be help in the following environments disputes within the office among office staff when the org ani za ti on receives complaint about the ombudsman or other office staff and discipline and removal of the ombudsman when the coop board receives complaint against certified practitioner and how the as an organization may address disputes
what is most appealing is that the office would be promoting modeling applying and learning from conflict resolution techniques ombudsmen are already familiar with and those that complement the ombudsman profession
if tracked the issues that arise for the ombudsman may provide the prof es sion with valuable data going forward in creating dialogue evaluating practices and standards and making improvements
conclusion we do not necessarily have to choose between sacrificing confidentiality and our own legitimate in te rests
ombudsmen and are no wonder woman or superman but mere mortals striving to achieve best practice in their roles within an organizational setting that can be fragile
they play unique role but in no way did they come into as un painted canvases or without complex tangled id en ti ties that define them and their limits
the profession can help support healthy discourse about the needs and interests of practitioners and tensions with the principle of confidentiality
this will help generate better guidance to practitioners and organizations on how to address difficult situations that arise for om buds men within the realm of confidentiality
informal dispute resolution mechanisms in particular may be the most natural course that nurtures fairness and process for the ombudsman and protects con fid en ti ality of underlying communications
as recently as this past month lawsuit filed by former ombudsman claiming retaliation by the college she had worked for in new york caught my attention
other than retaliatory actions for acting in her role she also raised issues of age gender and dis ability being motivating factors behind the adverse actions
it is powerful reminder indeed that although our interests as practitioners and individuals can be discussed through safe distance with hypo thetical scenarios as in this paper our need to be able to express and meet them is as real as we are
journal of the international ombudsman association in duma ti sen endnotes assuming there is no imminent risk of serious harm
or even for disputes between staff members of the office who as result of working for the office may not have ac cess to informal dispute resolution within the organization or may be privy to confidential information relevant to the dispute

remembering also that organizational ombudsmen claim that they are the of the confidentiality privilege and not the visitor it is difficult to argue that because has revealed communications from the session with the lege has been waived thus freeing to defend himself

there may also be an opportunity to have more direct confidentiality and dispute resolution agreement with constituents
for example as part of organizational policy or process all employees of an organization or office constituents may expressly agree to the standards and code in order to use the ombudsman resource through contractual understanding
this agreement could also include dispute resolution section that provides what op ti ons for dispute resolution would apply in case of an issue arising out of the office and what the ombudsman is pro tec ted from retaliation harassment abuse etc
since such an agreement would be offered to all employees equally and part of regular practice there would be no issue with identifying visitors as the agreement would exist even if an employee never visited the office
housing the agreement could be with department such as human resources but if the office is not identifying particular visitor it could potentially house copies of all the agreements
this would give the office the independence of not having to ask the organization for particular copies if they were needed
as mentioned above it may also allow office staff an interesting option for resolving issues arising in their unique workplace
in addition it may also provide private setting for visitors and the organization to raise concerns regarding the office or office staff

zero barrier office confidentiality organizational om
the author wishes to thank om buds at an east coast om buds group meeting for ideas on this subject several participants in london training group and three anonymous reviewers who were very diligent
practicing confidentiality is one of the four major principles of being an organizational om bud
confidentiality in the om buds office can be seen as the cornerstone for being and being seen as office within an org ani zati on
this professional practice is often interpreted as meaning that om buds keep no case records for the employer that om buds will not take action or speak about visit to the om buds office without perm is sion to do so and even then the om buds has to agree to act or speak and that the only exceptions to this practice are in very extreme cases
however people are often puzzled by how it is pos sib le to keep confidences nearly all the time
people often ask organizational om buds about the of confidentiality
for example manager may be concerned about om buds action if faced with visitor who describes totally unacceptable behavior
if the visitor refuses to act to stop the behavior and this vi si tor also refuses to report it what will the om bud do
questions about confidentiality sometimes are couched in the context of an imagined scenario
the om bud might be asked happens to con fid en ti ality when your visitor discusses terrible safety prob or racial or sexual assault or major embezzle ment and the visitor will not report it
the om bud may wish to answer such questions in three separate steps
the first is to quote and perhaps discuss the relevant sentences in the code of eth
the second step is to outline what visitors to the om buds office are told about confidentiality
and the third step is to point out there are options other than keeping silent or breach ing confidentiality
what happens to confidentiality if the visitor refuses to report unacceptable behavior
journal of the international ombudsman association mary ro we the code of ethics the code of ethics gives the following instr uc ti on about confidentiality the ombudsman holds all communications with those seeking assistance in strict con fi den ce and does not disclose confidential com munic at ions unless given permission to do so
the only exception to this privilege of con fid en ti ality is where there appears to be imminent risk of serious harm
it is clear from the code of ethics that all organization al om buds should be prepared for an imminent risk situation when they do have to breach confidential
confidentiality is not the same as confidentiality
it is important therefore to understand the parameters of imminence and serious harm
imminence may vary by context and serious si tua ti ons are usually quite complex
how might the om bud judge if serious harm is imminent
for example if visitor discusses possible destructive action by an individual the om bud will likely be thinking is this an imminently dangerous situation with this individual
in particular according to the guidance of experts what circumstances might the named individual act in dangerous fashion with respect to specific target
of are generally not very reliable beyond few hours or days
an om bud may therefore think about in terms of day or couple of days unless specific date is named for the harm
an om buds practitioner will likely consider breaching confidentiality if that is the only alternative to serious harm when in the judgment serious harm will ensue within day or two or by credible specified date if there is no intervention
it follows that when the question arises the pr ac ti ti oner might first ask himself or herself is this an emergency
could call someone in my organization or an expert outside the organization and ask advice in way that does not breach confidence
could speak in hypothetic als disclosing no names and get the information that need
do have time to ask advice for example from another om bud
if so the om bud will usually seek advice and usually in way that does not compromise confidentiality
in true emergency however the om bud must be prepared alone to make judgment of imminent risk and serious harm
expectations of confidentiality visitors to an om buds office should know what to expect about confidentiality
many om buds post their terms of reference and code of ethics and stan dar ds of practice on the office web site and in bro ch ur es and other materials
many om buds introduce themselves and mention their code and standards in an opening statement with all visitors
these intro duct ions may vary somewhat from office to office and the organizational context may affect how an om bud might define harm
options other than breaching confidentiality in real life in almost all situations the om bud can help to develop responsible options within an acceptable time frame that avoid an unacceptable alternative of silence and the unwanted alternative of breaching confidentiality
for example frequently visitor may not adequately understand rules and laws and policies relevant to the situation
thoughtful discussion of the facts of laws and rules and of responsible conduct may suffice to persuade visitor to act or come forward in reason able way
often visitor may agree to act responsibly in order to prevent harm to others in the future
and as outlined below there are many additional options for getting information surfaced in responsible fashion
it may be important to start by exploring the options already considered by the visitor
some visitors have indeed thought about reporting their concerns but they do not trust the supervisor that would be the obvious person with whom to speak
extensive dis cuss ion may serve to identify other relevant managers who may be seen to be approachable
as common example the visitor might be willing to go to senior manager after refusing to go to the immediate super visor
many people will agree to talk with just one par ticul ar person in the organization although not with others
this fact may be especially helpful when the visitor reports that he himself has done something unacceptable and when he knows at some level that the facts must be told
it may also work when he or she has been planning to do something unacceptable
journal of the international ombudsman association mary row ea person who might be danger to self or others might be willing to seek help from just one particular person in medical department
person who has done something very wrong is sometimes willing to herself to one particular person in se cu who is known to be respectful and trustworthy
sometimes person will agree to act if the om bud accompanies him or her to the medical department or security or to another line or staff manager
some visitors will not act immediately in the moment but may be willing to act after some time has passed or after the situation has changed in some way
per son might be willing to come forward after he or she has gotten transfer to different job
some students might feel safer reporting very serious problem in class when they have completed the given class
after discussion the om bud may feel the suggested time frame is acceptable under the circumstances
sometimes what is most needed is just for accurate and sufficient information to get where it needs to go
some visitors are willing to provide an anonymous factual account to the appropriate managers
for example visitor may be willing to slip an effective polite factual anonymous note under the door of senior manager or compliance officer
as different option of the same kind an om bud may be given permission to act in place of the vi si tor while protecting the identity of the visitor
many visitors will give permission for the om bud to provide information to relevant managers for action to be taken about the issue if the om bud can offer way of doing so without betraying the source of the in forma ti on
many om buds agree to listen to visitors who do not give their names that is visitors who come in or call as person persons anonymous visitors sometimes ask an om bud to get information where it needs to go
in yet different option the om bud may be given permission to instigate to find and take care of the problem
as an example suppose the visitor speaks of serious potential safety prob
could an apparently routine safety audit catch the relevant problem fast enough
might the si tua ti on then be further improved by enhanced safety training
if so how can the relevant information get to the relevant environmental health and safety office to catch the problem and provoke relevant action or training
for financial issue how can the relevant information be provided anonymously to the rel eva nt auditors
could an appropriate new policy on unacceptable behavior and training program serve to prevent unacceptable behavior on field trips
some visitors just need to learn the skills they need to act effectively on the spot or to report problem effectively
for example after preparing with the om bud visitor may be willing to try direct approach to perceived problem person or to compliance officer
this may happen even in cases where at the outset the visitor flatly refused to take action on his or her own
sometimes this becomes easier after the visitor has painstakingly collected all the facts of the situation
some visitors find direct approach easier if they prepare
as an example they might write out what they want to say about facts apparent damages or potential damage and any possible remedy
some visitors can find an who shares their concerns so they do not have to take ac ti on alone
some may be willing to take action if they can do so together with other ers
some visitors may be willing to come forward if they know they may be protected by credible policies against retaliation or whistle blower protection laws
some can be persuaded by the wish to protect other people right that you would not want anyone else to be hurt as you describe yourself to have been hurt
some people may be willing to come forward about part of problem in the hopes and exp ec ta ti on that the whole problem will come to light
the list above is obviously not exhaustive
if none of these ideas work one need not give up
an om bud may decide that situation is not an emergency and find way to say to the visitor we both know that some action must be taken here just touch base every day until we find an option that seems right
thinking about situation collaboratively in this way will often enough turn up an accept able option
on the other hand an om bud must take care not to be in subtle fashion by visitor who does not wish to take action about something serious
this might for example be some one who says there is no urgency here after all can always come in to talk with you here in the om buds office
in situations where there should be an ongoing discus sion the om buds will wish to take care to stay in close touch with the visitor until an acceptable solution is found
journal of the international ombudsman association mary ro we organizational om buds people are in position of great trust and are required to try their best to live up to this trust
nowhere is this more important than with maintaining near absolute in understanding the need to breach confidentiality where there is no other reasonable option
om buds are designated as independent neutrals and must try to be duly mindful of the interests of all who are stake holders in specific situation including the employer
an om bud might in very few cases have to breach confidentiality though some org ani zati on al om buds have never had to do so
in nearly all cases an om bud can develop other reasonable options
endnotes when organizational om buds formed professional assoc ia ti ons one of their first actions was to draft codes of ethics
confidentiality was from the first considered essential for professional practice
carole tr oc ch io of southland corpora ti on drafted the first confidentiality provision for the then corporate ombudsman association and group of acad em ic om buds drafted the confidential provision for
the resultant codes were melded when was formed
con fid en ti ality is also included in standard of practice the ombudsman holds all communications with those seeking assistance in strict confidence and takes all reasonable steps to safeguard confidentiality including the following the ombudsman does not reveal and must not be required to reveal the identity of any individual contacting the ombudsman office nor does the ombudsman reveal information provided in confidence that could lead to the identification of any individual contacting the ombudsman office without that express permission given in the course of informal discussions with the ombudsman the ombudsman takes specific action related to an in di issue only with the express permission and only to the extent permitted and even then at the sole discretion of the ombudsman unless such action can be taken in way that safeguards the identity of the individual contacting the ombudsman office
the only exception to this privilege of confidentiality is where there appears to be imminent risk of serious harm and where there is no other reasonable option
whether this risk exists is deter mina ti on to be made by the ombudsman
this question is discussed in depth in the om bud booklet dealing with the fear of violence what an org ani zati on al ombudsman might want to know in this respect the om buds office is in the same role as hot line
the om buds practitioner may however be more helpful than hot line can be because the practitioner may be able to ask number of questions to get more in forma ti on
an example of an advisory to help in such preparation may be found at ht tp web
ht ml standard of practice the ombudsman endeavors to be worthy of the trust placed in the ombudsman office
confidentiality imminent risk exceptions confidentiality is the one tenent that is often cited
as the most important of the standards of practice
as organizational ombudsmen we often meet with employees to explain the role of the om buds office at our company
the presentation which we call om buds office rollout for new employees or refresher for current employees focuses on what we mean by confidentiality and why it is so important in the context of the om buds office and our role
we explain how om buds confidentiality is very different from the confidentiality they have with their supervisors and even the global ethics and compliance office
it is often the trust in the security of the om buds con fi den ti ality that will make an employee feel comfort able coming forward to discuss their concerns with us
so then why would there ever be an exception to this important standard
well according to the standard of practice the only exception to the privilege of confidentiality is there appears to be im mine nt risk of serious harm and where there is no other reasonable option
whether this risk exists is determination to be made by the ombudsman
this seems very simple but in actuality the determination of imminent risk can be very difficult and in so many cases cannot be made without careful deter mina ti on but in some cases an immediate determination must be made
the determination of imminent risk is therefore only one level of the analysis
the other key determinants of the decision on whether there is imminent risk include consideration of whether there are reasonable options to breaking confidential
this is an important decision that is made by the ombudsman
practice note imminent risk serious exception to confidentiality ile ne but ensky journal of the international ombudsman association ile ne but ensky certainly the most dire cases of imminent risk and we are grateful to say they are few and far between are fairly straightforward
for example if someone is calling our office and tells us they are at the end and have no option but to end their life we of course would consider this an imminent risk
in such un for tun ate and unusual cases we would handle the call by making every effort to keep the caller on the line and by way of would link them to the employee assistance plan where trained professional will provide them with support
most of the work we do as ombudsman at our company is over the telephone where employees call us on free phone or toll free lines for discussion
this poses extra challenges since we cannot rely on body language or nonverbal communications
we have to use our active listening skills to sort out the details of the call
another example that typically meets the imminent risk exception is where there is dangerous weapon in the workplace
it is ironic that in so many of the po ten ti al imminent risk calls that come to our office the callers tell us they want something done immediately so that no life is put at risk but they just want their identity to be known
in the hypothetical case of dangerous weapon in the workplace we would contact local security or the police
it is often not so simple though as we try to determine whether there is an imminent risk of serious harm
recent case we dealt with in our office had to do with caller who discussed that there was what appeared to be toy gun in the workplace
is this or could this be considered imminent risk of serious harm
we had to ask ourselves is this imminent risk of serious harm and if so are there any alternatives
recall the exact outcome of this case and of course we have not written records but my recollection is the caller was willing to go forward and speak with his human resources manager so that confirmation could be made that the gun was not real and that even if it was real enough looking that panic ensue
the standard in our office is when in doubt we use our expert om buds skills to help us determine whether an imminent risk exists and if so what are the options to look at to avoid disclosure
safety is an extremely high standard in the manufacturing ties and this is therefore another area of potential imminent risk exceptions
again only after two step determination that the issue poses an imminent risk and there are not reasonable alternatives can the determination be made
it is our job and obli ga ti on as ombudsmen to be as creative and knowledge able to come up with options to discuss reasonable alternatives
going back to the discussions we have with employ and leaders in the company we try very hard to explain how our confidentiality standards are different from or the global ethics and compliance office
it is common for all three that is om buds eth and manager to say that conversations are held confidential but this has different meaning when it comes to om buds
conversation with an employee and manager are not confidential since the manager has duty to act
the same duty does not exist in the role of the ombudsman
manager is required to come forward even in cases where an employee tells the manager that there is situation that rises to the level of duty to act
the same is true for the global ethics function where they too have duty to act and investigate to determine the facts
this is not the same for om buds but we would have similar duty to act if in our determination there is an immi ne nt risk of serious harm
in terms of the determination process it is seldom that the ombudsman will need to make an im me di ate decision on the imminent risk
one example we faced in our office related to this point was caller who said she received which were related to her work
she wanted to take the threat seriously but want anyone to know about this
our ombudsman was able to protect the identity of the caller and arrange for the protection on an absolute to basis
the caller then gave us permission to give her name to the firm who would provide protection to her
later on when the caller felt more comfortable she gave us permission to divulge her identity
so what we did in this case was to the very least the best practices of an om buds should be to limit any such disclosure to only that needed to prevent or warn of imminent and potentially serious harm
howard we likely could have deter mined at the outset that this was case of imminent risk due to the allegation of death threat
in the course of our work as ombudsmen we always work to find other options to breaching confidential as we did in handling this case
journal of the international ombudsman association ile ne but ensky the process that is used in our office for determ in ing imminent risk in cases where we have the time to do so is to discuss with the om buds team or at minimum another ombudsman the facts as we know them to determine whether there is case of imminent risk
we have other resources available to us within the company who can assist with providing support even without disclosing confidential in for mat ion
resources that are available to us include the safety and security function environmental health and safety function and human resources
often it is not necessary to determine whether there is an imminent risk of serious harm and therefore need to make an exception to the confidentiality standard simply because the caller gives us permission to go ahead
in those unusual cases where permission is not granted then the office should have protocol on how to handle such difficult cases
this is especially true in cases where time is of the essence and little time exists to make decisions due to the urgency of the case and there do not appear to be any al terna

om uds man confidentiality mediation violation
accountability standards role multiple partie sa number of years ago after having facilitated mediation session between two coworkers received jolting call from danny one of the participants who had particularly abrasive style
know supposed to do this but just knew alex was lying during that mediation session so went around to the people who he said were badmouthing me and sure enough he was lying about it
they all told me they never said anything bad about me
now want another mediation session to set the record straight
mediation had been especially challenging with two people who had long history of animosity to ward each other including altercations that had nearly come to blows
the fact they had sat down together for conversation seemed like minor victory in light of their mutual mistrust even though the session went well their agreements seemed tentative
the call from danny was disheartening and frankly felt like was being put on the defensive
in the conversation had with danny regarding his complaint and request for new session many questions were raised for me regarding my role as an ombudsman mediator and my responsibilities if any related to behavior following process had managed
first how would address the issue of danny admitting to me he had violated ground rules he himself had agreed to and knowingly broken
second was there any obligation on my part to share with alex what knew about the violation
third was there any kind of consequence related to the violation in the absence of written agreement
finally how would respond to request in the moment in way that would be congruent with my neutrality
journal of the international ombudsman association nicholas die hl in this case it was not matter of danny learning ad dition al information about the situation incidentally
instead he knowingly violated the agreement the parties made regarding confidentiality and readily ad mit ted he had done so
one of the ironies of this case is the fact danny believed alex had been untruthful violating trust
meanwhile by taking steps to prove alex had lied danny himself broke his promise to keep the substance of the mediation confidential
it is no surprise confidentiality is frequently violated in mediation processes but as an internal conflict resolution practitioner had to consider whether had an obligation to alex to share my knowledge of the breach
also had to take into consideration the implications for the integrity of the mediation process and the credibility of the om buds office
it is certainly imaginable that many people knew of the violation of confidentiality since danny had spoken to them about the mediation session and such violation might impact the perception of the office for others in the organization
just as it is impossible to guarantee the parties in mediated process will not violate their own agree men ts to confidentiality there is reality that the or ga ni zati on al ombudsman role has an inherent vuln er ability in that practitioners are limited in defending themselves since the standards of practice frequently preclude any discussion of particular case
although confidentiality is central principle for both mediation and ombudsman practice it is very difficult to hold parties accountable for maintaining confidentiality especially when multiple parties are working together
in reality the only confidentiality mediator or ombudsman can promise is related to his or her own handling of information that has been provided within the parameters of the standards and the law
even in ombudsman cases in which there is just one party there are times when an inquirer might believe an ombudsman has breached confidentiality when in fact it is the inquirer who has inadvertently done so
for example worked with an inquirer who was convinced had divulged to her coworkers in forma ti on she had shared with me
when asked her who else she had spoken with about the situation she said she had only told three close friends in the they would never say anything to anyone
it was not hard for her to track down the source of the leak once she realized she had shared her private information with people who had not promised her confidentiality
as most om buds do when first work with an inquirer am careful to describe how confidentiality applies to my role at the beginning of our meeting
if the inquirer is particularly dubious that might break confidentiality encourage the person to consider carefully what they feel comfortable sharing based on their level of trust in me
also acknowledge that although make promise of confidentiality directly to the inquirer of course with the imminent risk of se rio us harm disclaimer our office charter describes my obligation to maintain confidentiality and practice to the international ombudsman association standards the inquirer is still making leap of faith in sharing information that is likely sensitive and could po ten ti ally put the inquirer in very vulnerable position if it were revealed
although have always asked parties in mediation session to discuss their expectations for confidential and to make an explicit agreement whether they will maintain confidentiality and to what extent both at the beginning and the end of the joint process have refined the way in which present the idea of confidentiality in one on one meetings and in joint sessions
similar to my approach in om buds cases give my perspective on the pros and cons of engaging in mediation and discuss the realistic limits of confidentiality and how difficult or im pos sib le it is to hold others accountable for maintaining confidentiality
while believe there is risk of making people pessimistic or overly cautious recommend people share what they are comfortable sharing and while one would hope all parties involved would honor the confidentiality of the process it is generally very difficult to substantiate whether someone has violated confidentiality unless they call you and tell you directly and generally there is very little or no recourse for holding another party accountable for violation
ultimately the party or parties involved should consider whether the potential benefit of sh ar ing information outweighs the risks
in the case of danny and alex declined request for followup mediation
felt danny was not acting in good faith
danny was very upset and journal of the international ombudsman association nicholas die hl mildly threatening to me in response to my decision
did not contact alex to share that confidentiality had been broken
there is high likelihood alex knew about the violation before did but never heard from him
there is also the possibility the parties would have both been agreeable to having an ad dition al mediation session but was struggling to bal an ce my obligations to confidentiality and neutrality with an ethical dilemma regarding my role in sharing information in light of confidentiality breach
although accountability is low in regard to parties maintaining confidentiality in this case there was minor consequence for danny did not fulfill his request for subsequent session
of course there may have also been consequences was unaware of related to his violation of confidentiality
this article focuses on the applicability of online dis pu te resolution for specific dispute resolution mechanism the ombudsman
the article is based on the experiences and observations of dr frank fowl ie who served as the inaugural ombudsman for the in tern et corporation for assigned names and numbers ic ann
it is submitted that is process that may be ap plied to alternative dispute resolution tech ni ques
specifically uses technology especially the internet to augment processes
it has been emphasized that may be applicable to disputes which emanate from either online or real world ac ti vi ties
for example may be used as vehicle to handle consumer disputes relating to online pur chasing of goods or it may be used as resolution system for small claims in direct business to consumer transactions
two types of online dispute resolution there are two basic branches of both based on the role of technology
the first branch may be called
technology based refers to those systems where technology plays an active role in conducting the dispute resolution
prominent example of technology based te ms are systems
the technology uses multivariate algorithms to help parties arrive at the optimal outcome
blind bidding systems are for the most part nascent technologies
they are usually most applicable in situations where there are some tangible and mon et ary remedy sought by the parties for example refund on faulty good or value for an insurance claim following car accident
the technology based system will assist parties to determine best and worst alternatives to negotiated agreement bat na and wat na
the technology receives inputs from the par ties and then draws from them to develop an optimal outcome
blind bidding systems are less likely as nascent tech nolo gies to be able to provide for the inclusion of the non quantum based variables such as apologies or the creation of new alternative solutions or options beyond the quantum values
the second branch of consists of technology assisted solutions
technology assisted refers to the use of technology to augment processes that exist independently of the technology
as the follow ing discussion will demonstrate technology assisted is well suited for ombudsman work as its tools allow for an increased efficiency of human based transactions and activities
online dispute resolution and ombudsmanship frank fowl ie journal of the international ombudsman association frank fowl ie the ic ann office of the ombudsman is good exam of technology assisted operation
the most important aspect of this position as an provider is the use of an online case management system
the case management system facilitates comm uni cations and correspondence between complainants the organization and the ombudsman
the aug men ts but does not replace the human aspect of the communication
the ic ann community is an online community
by definition participants in ic ann are online users as the role of the organization is to administer the domain name system which is the addressing backbone of the internet
disputes that occur within ic ann may be either in the real world or online in nature
unique element of the ic ann office of the ombudsman is that it serves global community
ic ann stake holders come from every nation in the world and span all time zones
as the ic ann of fice of the ombudsman is sole practitioner office it would be impossible to be operational hours day to communicate synchronously with complainants
however using the complainants the org ani za ti on and the ombudsman may engage in as yn ch ro nous communication
asynchronous communication may be described as parties sharing communications that is not direct real time conversation
for exam complainant in asia may use the to initiate complaint while the ombudsman is sleeping in north america the ombudsman may then respond to the complainant after office hours have closed in asia
the also allows for the collection and analysis of data for statistical reporting
during the case intake process information such as the country location and category of complaint are recorded
in closing the complaint the ombudsman designates the re so lu ti on type and confirms the complaint category
these statistical records help to identify complaint trends which may assist in providing early intervention on systemic issues
these three technical adjuncts case management asynchronous communication and trend id en ti fica ti on all assist and augment the human based act iv in handling complaints
however the ombudsman process is still driven by the human based activities of investigating developing questions options and recommendations and communicating findings and reports
thus we may conclude that technology assisted is appropriate for ombudsmen
generally is relatively new field in dispute resolution
it remains in its infancy but it continues to grow in rapid manner
as has grown it has begun to codify its activities
for example in the advisory committee of the national centre for tech no logy and dispute resolution developed the dispute resolution standards of
these standards inform practitioners about basic rules of practice
similar to the best practices standards developed for organizational ombudsman by the international om buds man association the standards of pr ac tice covers broad principles of practice as opposed to prescriptive rules
the standards of practice include these subject matters accessibility afford ability transparency fairness innovation and relevance third parties and general standards
four practitioner roles in technology assisted dispute resolution there are four broad categories of practitioners who are well suited to using technology assisted functionalities
these roles include online mediators online conflict managers online conflict resolvers and ombudsmen
in the first role practitioners may act as media tors
people in conflict with another party may come to an practitioner and say you help me to negotiate with the person with whom am in con
the mediator is somewhat passive in the pro cess in that they are uniquely conduit for the flow of communication between the parties and are not at all protagonist
there are several very good examples of this mediation role
second there is the role of conflict manager
this role kicks in when one party says that there is problem and requests the neutral third party to assist in keep ing the issue from escalating
the question posed by the parties to the practitioner might be we have relationship and there is problem and we want you to help us manage it before it gets worse
journal of the international ombudsman association frank fow li eo dr systems that look at issues such as levels of sup port or child access in family law are examples of this role
third there is the role of conflict resolver
the conflict resolver takes on this role when the parties say were not able to manage the conflicts between us or we did not come to you in time to manage those con flic ts and there has now been meaningful change to our relationship that we need the help of third party to resolve
both parties may not necessarily share this perspective simultaneously
for example your bank because it is big institution may think it simply needs to manage an issue when it inadvertently over draws your account however to you as the consumer it is conflict that needs to be resolved rather than be managed because the overdraft has caused you to distrust the bank and there has been fundamental change in your relationship with the bank
fourth there is the role of the internet based om buds man meaning ombudsmen who are online practitioners
in this final scenario the parties would come to the ombudsman and ask the following ques ti on have conflict between us because one of us feels unfairly treated by the other
can you work with us evaluate this situation and if one of us was treated unfairly can you help us work out solution that we all can work with and that is fair
this article concerns itself with this last category of practitioner however ombudsmen use wide range of tools in handling conflict and they may use the same skill sets as mediators conflict managers and conflict resolvers
the ombudsman and dispute resolution an ombudsman is an independent objective investigator of complaints against govern ment agencies and other organizations both public and private sectors
after fair thorough review the ombudsman decides if the complaint is justified and makes recommendations to the organization in order to resolve the problem
ombudsmanship came into being in when the swedish parliament appointed the first ombudsman to protect citizens from the excesses of bureaucracy
the word ombudsman consists of two parts om buds meaning representative and man gender nonspecific term meaning the people
historically an om buds man has been the representative of the people in dealings with bureaucracy
in quebec the om buds man is referred to as protector of the citizens while in france the ombudsman is called state mediator
are generally concerned with ensuring that the bureaucracy or agency they oversee fairly treats the members of their constituency
om buds men are generally characterized as being inde pen dent impartial and neutral advocates neither for the agency nor the complainant but rather for the prin of administrative fairness
it is worthwhile to consider the distinction between substantive fairness which can be defined as fair outcome of an admin is tr at ive process and procedural or administrative fairness which is defined in the following paragraphs
ombudsmen are generally concerned with admin is tr at ive fairness as opposed to results in regulatory or criminal processes
ombudsmen deal with the redress of unfair situations rather than the administration of compliance frameworks
the code of admin is tra justice by the british columbia ombudsman lists at least criteria for administrative fairness
these include issues such as unreasonable delay and unfair procedures
this article relies primarily on that code of admin is tr at ive justice to provide working definition of ad ministrative fairness that can be applied consistently and universally for ombudsman purposes
fairness can have different meanings across context culture language and tradition
the code of administrative fairness provides an excellent example of describing in neutral and explicit terms
administrative fairness has been defined in the fol lowing manner our judges have had an historic association with the concept which we call process of law
the phrase which has its roots in the magna car ta sums up our attachment to civil no less than to legality
in popular terms it means fair play assuring hearing on the pros and cons of an issue to those affected apprising them of what they have to meet or in criminal case of the charges against them giving them an opportunity to produce witnesses and to counter evidence adduced against them al lowing them to present argument on the facts and legal issues raised in the litigation and assuring them finally of considered decision journal of the international ombudsman association frank fowl ie by an impartial judge
what is important about due process is the fact that its rationale has taken hold beyond the courtroom and has been applied in administrative proceedings and to public affairs generally
it has in short become social norm implying both right of individuals and groups in our society who have grievances to air or demands to press or claims to litigate to make themselves heard and correlatively an obligation to advance their causes through rational procedures which after painful ex peri en ce have displaced naked force as the means through which the case is made for change and the redress of wrongs
ombudsmen can be important actors in the overall operation of the civil justice system
they provide alternative dispute resolution services which may reduce the propensity for costly and time consuming grievances and litigation
their existence and pres en ce ensures that administrative fairness is supported in wide variety of civil and business institutions
there are number of factors driving the ad op ti on of systems
it is undeniable that there are increasing numbers of people in disputes who either lack the resources to engage lawyer who do not meet the means test for legal aid whose issue is outside of the legal aid remit or those who simply choose to act without rep re sent ati on
recently the supreme court of canada published an unrepresented guide due to the growth in cases heard by the court where citizens appear without counsel
is vehicle that allows the parties to dispute to resolve the matter with or without the ti on of third parties
it allows the private ordering of affairs regardless of locale jurisdiction or legislative paradigm
the ability to seek resolution redress and potentially justice from the comfort of own liv ing room with little or marginal expense is attractive to many
this is not to say that is replacement for brick and mortar court rooms
in fact may be particularly well suited to number of areas where the courts already have jurisdiction
it has its greatest potentials in ec om merce small claims and inter per son al disputes
the astounding growth of ec om merce has drawn the attention of international organizations such as the united nations and the organization for economic cooperation and development oe cd
in the oe cd produced set of consensus recommendations on consumer dispute resolution and redress
these recommendations state that processes should enable consumers to conduct the redress procedure without the need for legal representation or assistance as much as possible
the oe cd also recommends the greater use of technology to resolve disputes
the united nations through number of its bodies including the world intellectual property org ani za ti on the united nations commission on international trade law and united nations social and economic commission for the asia pacific has shown great interest in online dispute resolution
one of the first and most often accessed te ms is the uniform domain name resolution policy
the is policy that has been instituted by the ic ann to deal with disputes over the right ownership of domain names and in particular cy ber squatting
ic ann has developed set of rules that describe when someone is disputing ownership or claims someone is cy ber squatting on domain
ic ann works with four international arb it ra ti on providers the national arbitration forum from the united states the world intellectual property organization from geneva the czech arbitration court center for internet disputes in prague and the asia domain name arbitration centre headquartered in hong kong
to give examples of those involved in process trademark owner who wished to register domain name may be located in ver the cy ber squatter in china and the arbitrator in europe
this process has worked for thousands of cases around the globe privately transnationally and outside of the courts
large body of related jurisprudence has been established and this is used by the national courts who are the appeals bodies
finally in world that is increasingly concerned with being or eco friendly inherently reduces the amount of paper used
now and in the future it is possible that disputes make be resolved without the use of paper
for example small claims discoveries may be conducted by the filing of documents online parties may be examined through chat rooms and whole ombudsman investigations may take place entirely online
journal of the international ombudsman association frank fowl ie based on all of this information it is submitted that the world is increasingly witnessing an accelerated growth in the use of systems and techniques
is there role for in ombudsman programs
the previous section underscores reasons why is increasingly becoming used across wide selection of dispute techniques
the uptake of into ombudsman programs may be based on any of these factors of economy efficiency the environment or changes in professional acceptance of the technol
techniques may be well used in om buds man programs but in looking at the applicability of three factors must be taken into consideration
first the ombudsman practitioner must under stand the differences between technology based and technology assisted and must select and implement the appropriate form of for his or her practice
second the ombudsman practitioner should consider number of criteria to determine how and in what manner provides with his or her op erat ions
third ombudsman practices may need to be modified in order to integrate into the conduct of work
factor one technology based or technology assisted for ombudsmen
earlier in the article we looked at the two forms of online dispute resolution technology based and technology assisted
briefly we described technology based primarily as blind bidding system which allows two parties in dispute to use multivariate matching to obtain win win outcome
technology based is likely most applicable for disputes where there is quantum involved ie the value for vehicle in an insurance claim that is disputed between the owner and the insurance company
technology assisted uses technology to improve the efficacy of human based processes
for example the use of fax machines rather than postal services has improved the rapid exchange of correspondence
technology assisted is scalable to the needs finances and technical competencies of dispute re so lut ion programs
in our previous analysis of ombudsmanship we underlined that the basis for ombudsman work is established in the concept of fairness
we emphasized that the concept of fairness is the basis of om buds man work
fairness is not concept that may be easily actualized in blind bidding environment
therefore we can conclude that technology assisted is the most appropriate form of for use in ombudsman programs
factor two criteria to determine whether fits into an ombudsman practice ombudsmen may wish to consider number of criteria when planning to implement as tool or when considering the sc al ability of their programs
consideration of these criteria will inform ombudsmen about the level of technology they will require to conduct successful od ras sist ed practice
the criteria that ombudsman may wish to consider legislative case management users and complaint literacy and internet time service client or audience synchronous and asynchronous usage the sociocultural context
journal of the international ombudsman association frank fowl ie geography ombudsmen must take geography into account when they contemplate the use of
om buds men should consider such questions as where are the potential system users located
are they all in one building or dispersed over several countries or continents
is the ombudsman operation located in one place or is it decentralized operation with many offices where information needs to be shared
does the mandate of the ombudsman cover defined geo graphic area such as country province or state city or hospital or university campus
if the ombudsman operation is located in corporation or organization is the client group located in the same location or building or in multiple locations cities provinces or states or continents
legislative considerations before embarking on implementations ombudsmen practitioners must evaluate their chartering documents bylaw statute or legislation to determine if there are any barriers to using
ombudsmen must determine if complaints must be delivered in particular manner
for example if signature is required do intakes have to be done in person to verify identity
are there privacy or in for mat ion access laws that impact the use of in the ombudsman operation
ombudsman must also have an awareness of leg is lative frameworks which impact on privacy con fi den ti ality access to information and compellability of records as these will be determinative factors in considering
practitioners may wish to design specific user agreements which add thicker layers of confidentiality around the processes
case management users and complaint volume ombudsmen need to consider the sc al ab il and cost of with respect to the volume of complaints received and the number of system users
obviously the unit cost for implementation drops if the number of complainants or ombudsman of fi cia ls using the system is greater
ombudsmen must carefully consider the per unit costs against existing costs for travel investigation interviews etc
has particular appeal when ombudsman inv es tig at ions involve systemic events or when there are multiple complaints on file
the use of technol easily track large volumes of correspondence and enables ombudsman investigators differentiate or combine fact patterns evidence communications and outcomes as the investigation and redress pro cess progresses
literacy and language ombudsmen must be aware of the languages in which system users may wish to communicate and ombudsmen must also take into consideration both the general literacy and computer literacy of their client group
if ombudsmen serve multilingual client group the system should be designed to accommodate system inputs in all the languages served or to take into consideration translation services
translations may be accomplished by using online translation tools or by using native language translators
ombudsmen must take translation as matter of concern for both incoming correspondence from complainants and for outgoing correspondence to them
ombudsmen must include the use of language and idioms as part of the general literacy factor
for ex ample is client group that usually communicates in slang or patois well served in written environment
ombudsmen when considering the imp le menta ti on of must evaluate the general literacy level of their client group and their computer literacy
if clients or ombudsman staff lack either general lit era cy or computer literacy skills ombudsmen should reconsider the implementation of
internet connectivity ombudsmen must evaluate the internet con of their clients
there is an obvious difference between local dialup access and broadband high speed internet
ombudsmen should also consider the availability of computers or mobile technologies that enable clients to access the system
if om buds men are serving clients in areas where there is limited network connectivity or where there is limited computer access then may be less successful than an area where there is high broadband or device penetration
journal of the international ombudsman association frank fowl ie time zones ombudsmen must consider the hours of access they wish to offer the time zones they serve and the appropriate times that clients can access the system
does the office wish to be available on basis
does the ombudsman serve clients in multiple time zones ie are clients spread across all of canada which has time zones
are the clients most likely to use the system during working hours or outside of them
service requirements ombudsmen must reflect on the need for service requirements in designing and implementing an system
human rights ombudsman who investigates unfair habeas corpus practices in con zone may have different service response require men ts than consumer oriented banking om buds man program
if clients are at immediate risk then the system must be designed to be very reactive
client or audience characteristics is there anything specific about the client group which would inform the ombudsman about the design of the system
for example the ic ann office of the ombudsman serves specific audience that is based on some sort of relationship with the internet
one may infer that this client audience may be highly computer literate
the same may be said for audiences in universities
if the ombudsman serves client group that consists of person with disabilities is likely to have the same impact as face to face activities
for example persons who have disabilities which restrict their mobility may find it more ac commo dat ing to use technologies as opposed to having to take great efforts to attend an office
as well persons who have disabilities which affect their ability to communicate in person such as deafness or psychiatric or cognitive disabilities may find the use of synchronous technologies to be preferred manner of dealing with their complaint
synchronous and asynchronous usage synchronous use of an system means that the client and the ombudsman are able to comm uni cate in real time
these real time online conversations or chats may be conducted through the case manage ment or system or by other means such as email or social networks
asynchronous communication means that the conversation between the parties does not occur in real time
well this principle easily applies when there is time zone change it also applies in social or familial con text
for example young family with children may find it convenient to communicate with the om buds man at the end of the day when the chores are done and the children are tucked away in bed and this correspondence is received by the ombudsman the following morning
the ombudsman replies to the family and it is received by them later in the evening etc
this allows provides the family the convenience of having their complaint attended to without having to take time away from work or home responsibilities to visit the office
the context ombudsmen wishing to implement systems should take into consideration the general sociocultural context in which they operate
there will be differences in communication and culture between high context and low context societies
this will help inform the ombudsman of the potential for success
the system must be designed to ac com mo date the cultural requirements of the client group
factor three modifying the ombudsman practice each of the three basic forms of ombudsman ship classical executive and organizational to some greater or lesser extent has the capacity to use as tool in the practice of ombudsmanship
classical ombudsmen are appointed by govern ment to receive complaints at provincial state or national level
these complaints relate to the general functioning of governmental administrative activities
executive ombudsmen may be appointed by gov ern ment ministry corporation association or entity to take complaints about specific administrative functions
this is the group of ombudsmen presently experiencing the greatest growth
executive om buds man may hear complaints from wide populace that exceeds state or territorial boundaries
for example the client group may be all of the customers of an in ter national bank or they may be all of the passengers of worldwide airline
journal of the international ombudsman association frank fowl ie organizational ombudsmen usually deal with internal clients of an institution such as employees or students
organizational ombudsmen may deal with issues beyond fair administration and often are involved in relationship issues
of these three types of ombudsman practice the ex ec ut ive ombudsman role is likely the one with whom would have the greatest impact
that is not to say that classical and organizational ombudsmen would not benefit from but simply that because of the nature of executive potentially wide client bases may most benefit executive ombudsmen
ombudsmen might have to modify their practices to accommodate in number of ways which might an appropriate case management and corresp on den ce system
this could be one off purpose built system or it could simply be an existing email program
for security reasons it is strongly advised that the case management or mail systems be housed on separate secure server independent of other applications within the organization business or government
be proactive in providing web site that promotes the ombudsman function and that links to the complaint intake case management system
the web site should contain reasonable amount of self help information to educate inform and assist potential clients
have the capacity to provide native language trans la tors for complainants
community resources may be available to assist
translators must be covered by either privacy laws or nondisclosure agree men ts to keep the correspondence they review as private and confidential
be prepared to develop effectiveness measures relating to the use of
ombudsmen especially those who deal with multicultural client groups must develop sense of self and their own culture as they work with online documents to conduct dispute resolution
culture in this case refers especially to how people develop sociocultural context to the manner in which they resolve disputes
practitioners need to be particularly aware of their own culture as they work with clients or institutions that are different from them in the high context low context scale
in scenarios ombudsmen must be prepared to allow correspondents to display their own conflict culture without the ombudsman forcing complain ants to adopt the conflict culture
ombudsmen must be able to allot time and energy to work with complainants who have low general or computer literacy skills
the same skills used in active listening may be applied to
ombudsmen must practice writing skills that will assist in developing environment
ombudsmen must be aware that correspondents may have tendency with the written word to stray from core issues and processes
much of the ombudsman process will be to focus on these core issues and to use the many tools in the om buds man tool box to develop options and possible outcomes
conclusion ombudsmanship is field of dispute re so lu ti on which can greatly benefit from the use of online dispute resolution as tool
there are presently very few ombudsman operations that practice
those who have engaged have found that it has the capacity to increase effectiveness in complaint handling
as we enter the second decade of the st century we can expect to see an uptake of in the practice of ombudsmanship
ombudsman practitioners may wish to take the fol lowing guidelines into account as they consider the use of timing is this the appropriate point in time to launch an program
are there risks or benefits to waiting to start using
economy can case be made for the expenditure of resources both capital and human to use
will there be an efficiency gained in managing files or the technology process which makes the opera ti on run more effectively
audience does the use of increase access to ombudsman operations
will new users be attract ed to the system
will other users be affected due to lack of computer literacy
are there strategies journal of the international ombudsman association frank fowl ie to overcome barriers
are there particular audience segments which will particularly benefit from
technology will technologies replace im or make redundant any existing case man age ment system
is custom designed system most appropriate
organizational communications how will we in form our audience of the movement towards
practitioner accommodations what will the office of the ombudsman need to do to ac commo date the use of into its practice
ombudsmen who determine that there is place in their practice for the deployment and use of will be at the cutting edge of both fields and ombudsmanship
we may predict that as both fields continue to grow the use of technology to assist in dispute resolution will become commonplace

introduction upon even cursory analysis it is axiomatic that conflict in organizations is unavoidable
in fact it is an organic byproduct of any interpersonal relation ship
conflict as positive phenomenon however can serve as valuable tool for change and improvement as well as platform for communication creativity and collaboration
conversely when poorly managed conflict can lead to systemic breakdown in organizational effectiveness
un for tu nate ly the absence of conflict competence among many organizations seems to be rather salient trend
studies indicate that companies suffer measurable damage when they do not manage conflict effectively sla ik eu has son
such issues can manifest themselves in the form of decreased product iv increased turnover lack of complaint reporting increased legal costs and reduction in employee morale
implementing effective conflict management systems however can aid in ameliorating these stresses
this article is predicated on the notion that the ma of companies fail to manage conflict effectively
although may not be appropriate for all firms they are conducive to many organizations that for reasons unknown continue to employ approaches to conflict resolution that result in high costs and low satisfaction for all parties concerned
the seemingly symbiotic nature of an proclivity for litigation and its dissatisfaction with the concomitant results is not radically new notion sla ik eu has son
simply put the costs of ineffective conflict management are becoming burden that many companies simply cannot sustain
journal of the international ombudsman association jason waxman all stages of the conflict management process but to implement non adjudicatory methods especially use of an ombudsperson at an early stage in order to positively affect value benchmarks while promoting healthy and sustainable interpersonal relationships within organizations
to date no known inquiry has been made into the value determinant on the origins of the om buds pro gram
there is no research concerning the perceived or realized monetary benefit in the establishment of an om buds program through crisis or non crisis means
the decision to differentiate between crisis and non crisis adopter firms is necessary to articulate discrepancies associated with the genesis of system
in other words are there implications if the establish ment of an om buds program was forced onto cor po rate ecosystem as opposed to one that was born of natural evolution
moreover no studies have been conducted do cu ment ing the perception dissonance if any within the corporate strata toward the ombudsperson and the consequential effects on fiscal relevance
the addition of data coding to include the different hierarchical levels is based on research from field practitioners which demonstrated in particular middle manage resistance to the om buds concept
cons id er ing the typical role that the ombudsperson assumes within an organization middle management seems to be the most affected upon implementation especially as it relates to human resource managers
in fact the inclusion of an ombudsperson may cause these man agers to feel threatened largely due to perceived threat to their autonomy lip sky see ber finch er
human resource managers in some instances believe that the om buds function is being employed due to their own inadequacies with respect to conflict management
offering comparison therefore of perceived value differences between crisis and non crisis adopters in addition to cross strata sensitivity analysis is the first of its kind
by illuminating the impact of this frame work organizations should be convinced that an om buds office like other business functions is valuable component in successful and sustainable business plan
moreover the data may demonstrate ways in which existing frameworks can be improved
overall the profession has yet found clear defi nit ion of effectiveness that it can use to attempt to influence the expectations of key stake holders regard ing the added value of this miller
moreover the examination that has been conducted focuses solely on overall satisfaction with the process itself rather than on its relevance to organizational effectiveness lip sky et al
in short the field has not yet justified its successes in financial terms
this has proven to be significant impediment to growth and expansion largely because the adv an tag es of these systems have only been documented in and fashions lip sky et al
data introduction and perceived efficacy of the om buds concept the primary method of data collection for this research was through nonprobability survey process
in sum two crisis adopter and non crisis adopter companies were targeted for total of organizations
the characteristics of these companies are shown in table
the survey which was con fid en ti al and anonymous in nature as it reveals no employ ee or company names was disseminated to appro xi mately individuals within these various firms
the research process was carried out in march
the total number of completed returned surveys was
the distribution in responses between crisis and non crisis companies was to respectively

the content of reviewed manuscripts and of reviews should not be shared with anyone other than the editor of the
it is important for reviews to have forward looking beneficial intent this is an opportunity to give feed back that will help nurture guide and develop author ship
it is not an exercise in showing you know more are wiser or more clever and literate in the subject matter
authors should learn from reviews and take away from the review sense of future direction and beneficial development for their paper
the aim of the review is to strengthen contributions to the and thereby strengthen the ombudsman profession
in this sense review is as much critique of the reviewer as of the manuscript
accordingly it is requirement that all reviews offer information that can help guide the author
although reviews journal of the international ombudsman association are confidential ie the manuscript author does not know who the reviewers are they are best written as though the author is in the room
accordingly use test of the assertions is the test if they were standing in the dock at the old bailey would they be able to justify their assertions to the author
are they making statements that are justifiable verifiable and credible or just say so
does the tone of their review convey the standards of practice in practice

suggestions for modi fi cation should not be returned to the editor in the form of in the original manuscript
this would identify the reviewer to the author and even if this does not concern the reviewer it might concern or prejudice the author in their consideration of the comments
reviewing is form of power relationship
that is why anonymity is required on both sides
manuscripts may come in variety of styles from the determinedly academic with numerous citations and references to the determinedly idiosyncratic and personal

the author wishes to convey her deep gratitude to os hi ko taka has hi and mary ro we
journal of the international ombudsman association nori ko tad ai have thought about these methods in looking back on my own experience
when worked for japanese company as systems engineer just after graduating from college took several issues to one of our senior employees se np ai
as new young employee it was not easy to express my difficulties to my boss directly
in the event se np ai talked to the boss and the boss changed the work system to support me
did not expect that se np ai would talk to the boss or that the prob would be solved so quickly
as it turned out it was not just se np ai senior employee but also do ki who joined the company in the same year as and former boss who was willing to be potential bridge toward managers
helping to deal with conflict was task they took on vol un tari ly
it is not their job officially
permit me now to write about the concept of person in the organization
he or she may not be decision maker but have lot of influence with the decision makers in every organization
depending on the specific issue and the specific situation the key person may be different each time
so there are many different key people in an org ani za ti on
if you are new employee you do not know who the key people are
if you work in the organization long enough you know who they are and how to contact them
traditionally in japan once you join the organization you may work there until you retire
in such context even if you are new in the organization you will wish to learn who is key person about which issues and how to make contact with such person in natural way
however nowadays employees join company and then may leave in the middle of their careers
there are now variety of types of employment for example there are temporary part time and contract employees
in such fluid context people also change jobs and responsibilities
for the new employee it can be difficult to know who key person is
in this situation an can be the liaison for an employee with relevant key person
and with many many key people
in my work as one really meaningful experience is when can connect the employee who comes to see me to the key person
when can identify just the right key person and connect the employee who has concerns to that person concerns will be dealt with in proper way
key people know how to work with conflicts informally in the organization
of course the can also connect to relevant decision maker directly
the can in this way play the role of the key person
however depending on the issues the connecting an employ ee to key person may have stronger impact than the connecting with the decision maker directly
one reason this can happen is that sometimes decision makers take key persons more seriously
the decision maker may listen more easily to the voice of key person who knows more in his or her field than anyone else
and the decision maker may be more comfortable after listen ing to key person to make decisions
putting these thoughts together decision maker may not know exactly what has happened in the field since he or she is in high position but may be comfortable in making decisions on the basis of reports from trusted
there is also second reason why the referral mode may sometimes be preferable
where the refers an employee to key person the role of is to help the employee to learn method rather than just fixing problem for someone who did not know how to do it
there is also third journal of the international ombudsman association nori ko tad areason why the referral mode may sometimes be preferable
using this method the may ad dition ally strengthen the informal problem solving network in the organization
an can nearly always find out who are key people with respect to the issues at hand
an can be bridge between people in the organization
an can maximize the po ten ti al of resolving conflicts in the organization by helping to strengthen the key person and the informal network and thereby in the organization
when started to work as an had some difficulty in developing deep understanding of the function
at that time dr taka has hi who was the first in japan explained the role as in japanese traditional theater
let me try to describe this idea
wi kipe dia says that in kabuki the serve many of the same purposes as running crew
they move scenery and props on stage aiding in scene changes and costume changes
they will also often play the role of animals will ot he wisps or other roles that are played not by an actor in full costume but by holding prop
wear all black head to toe in order to imply that they are invisible and not part of the action onstage
he will never be an actor
however without the play will never be performed
an in the organization is like on the stage
an does not need to be recognized officially about his or her work
however people know that without the office the organization does not work as effectively
thus as this is one way to explain the concept of informality as principle of organizational om buds in japan
and there is more to say about the importance of this idea
we all know that in our organization and in our whole society there are many unknown invisible people who support people in the organization and in society
traditionally japanese organizations greatly appreciated the hard workers
the wonderful thing is that even though they themselves may be invisible there are key people who can really whole situation and help make it better
and it is very important that the importance of these invisible people be re cog ni zed
it also follows that if your organizational culture does not value invisible workers it may be difficult to be an
the organization cannot use the full potential of an office as part of an system if informal conflict management is not valued
whether an office will work ef fec or not work depends on the organizational culture
challenges while am working as an remind myself that is part of coherent prof es sion al platform together with the other three principles confidentiality neutrality and inde pend en ce
thinking about the four principles together may present challenges in practice chal leng es that must be met
in the process of dealing with concerns concerns are is an important aspect of practice in japan
it is often said by people from the west journal of the international ombudsman association nori ko ta da that communication among the japanese is full of ambiguity
if you deal with concerns informally since people in japan are used to dealing with concerns informally they may have expectations that are not verbalized explicitly
people who call the office may expect that the will work with the org ani za ti on to solve their concerns for them
they expect that their information will be used only for their benefit
if the information is used only for their benefit they do not care if the information was revealed without their permission
in this way they do understand
but an has to be careful to review all expectations with each caller and take care to explain the other three prin and to explain all four of the principles together
when explain carefully and then check their expectations the people who call me understand and we more consciously deal with the issues in the context of all four principles
through this process feel that structuring informality together with the other three principles is part of the uniqueness and strength of the function in japan
the japan institute for labour policy and
the concept of do ki is often important to the success of informal networks
in japan every april most big companies hire new employees who have just graduated from school in march
big company might hire hundreds of new employees at the same time
then the company gives them training teaching about corporate culture business manners work related knowledge and providing on the job training from week to year
in my own case when joined the company as systems engineer as new employee took month train ing from april
then started on the job training
in newly hired sales people took months of training before
so the company really trains its new employees
since new employees are really spending lot of time together for training they develop special feeling amongst themselves
they are good friends and at the same time they will be rivals competing with each other
in the company we say are the year of or is my do ki having joined the company in the same year
in certain sized japanese organization they regularly transfer employees as one of management strategies
it means that your boss changes regularly
keid an ren japan business federation indicated the importance of communication in the organization from the viewpoint of corporate management and competition in the report on may
japan is categorized as communication system
hall claims that human interaction on the broad level can be divided into low context and high context communication system
high context com munic ati on we emphasize how intention or meaning can best be conveyed through the context eg social roles or positions and the nonverbal channels
pauses silence tone of voice of the verbal message
on the other hand low context communication we emphasize how intention or meaning is best expressed through explicit verbal messages

journal of the international ombudsman association carolyn no orb ak hs hab stract carolyn shares her thinking about the emergence of informality as standard of practice for and how it is important to her as an sop
she also discusses some of the challenges she experiences with informality and provides examples of situ at ions when it may be tempting to forego informality but ultimately always chooses to adhere to sops
when in the ombudsman field initially belonged to the ombudsman association toa
toa did not hold as standard of practice
informality was not discreet sec ti on of training like confidentiality neutrality and independence yet it was clearly conveyed to trainees that informality was critical part of the ombudsman role
remember joking with visitors about the fact that being informal meant that have too much paper work as was an the resource and loved that part of my job
my of spiel with respect to informality was and continues to go something like as an informal resource do not participate in any formal processes within or outside of the organization and attempts to subpoena me will be met with every effort to resist
when the merger between toa and the university and college om buds association occurred and became the international ombudsman association informality became standard of practice
practice confidentiality neutrality independence journal of the international ombudsman association carolyn ethics says this about informality ombudsman as an informal resource does not pate in any formal adjudicative or administrative procedure related to concerns brought to his her attention
this change how practiced or how thought about my practice
however it did prompt me to consider what does or should go into deciding what ombudsman sops ought to be
it that thought informality should not be an sop have an opinion one way or the other but decided should
had certainly heard colleagues express opinions both pro and con on having informality as an sop
find even now six years post merger that informality still does not get the attention in training courses that other sops receive and some still believe it does not qualify as an sop
however ultimately concluded that informality most definitely belongs in standards of practice
use this forum to explain my rationale and to lament about those ways in which find informality to be sometimes challenging
when pondering the question should our standards of practice be
thought about men ts of om buds practice
certainly confidentiality and neutrality were among the elements con side red to be paramount enough to warrant sops
wondered about independence but also about transparency fairness justice and respect
where did these elements fall on the importance scale
there are additional important elements that we can all think of as well
just how do we define those elements that should qualify as standards of practice
here is where landed sops should be those elements of ombudsman practice that define us that separate us that make us different from any other roles or functions in our organizations
surely someone else has landed in the same place have and do not intend to convey this as an original idea
do not however recall seeing any previous writing on this so apologize to anyone who has already described the sops in this manner elsewhere
given that organizational om buds are an the resource and they do not participate in formal adjudicative processes and they resist testifying internally or externally to their organization this seemingly qualifies as way in which we are different from other roles in our organizations and therefore belongs as an sop
moreover find informality so inextricably woven with the other sops that we have to practice informally in order to be confidential neutral and independent
perhaps this is why toa did not initially deem it necessary to make informality its own sop
here are some examples of what mean by informality being tied into the other sops consider whether or not we would be practicing confidentially if we were to participate in formal processes such as grievance hearing
even if our visitor wants to waive confidentiality and asks us to participate in their hearing just showing up would breach confidentiality as visitors cannot waive confidentiality
any participant in the hearing supervisors hr legal department re pres en ta etc
would have to wonder just how confidential our practice is if we show up for hearings let alone offer any input to the proceeding
or think about our legal departments requesting our records on particular visitor whose attorney has notified our organization of pending litigation
providing any information would not only mean that we were no longer acting informally but we would not be neutral or independent either
pro vi ding information to our legal departments could convey the notion of being an arm of manage journal of the international ombudsman association carolyn which compromises independence confidentiality and neutrality
of course ideally given we are not offices of record we should not possess any records except perhaps aggregate data to provide anyone with anything in writing or verbally for that matter
and what about the situation where our boss comes to us and says and so since you are perceived by everyone to be fair and unbiased want you to look into this troublesome complaint from department that department is inappropriately using their credit cards
if you will let me know what you find out and if anyone is committing any fraud what you think we should do about
although we might be flattered by our bosses impression that perceives us to be fair and unbiased it seems we are being asked to conduct formal investigation and make decisions about action the boss should take should wrongdoing be discovered
if we did as the boss asked we would obviously be compromising our informality standard but we would also not be act ing independently or neutrally
in each of these examples compromising informality would also launch us into breaches of multiple sops
from the standpoint of personal preference certainly appreciate when someone asks me to act in way that falls outside the parameters of informality being able to say sorry that is not in keeping with the standard of practice on informality
want to engage in processes that could result in negative job action for visitor or anyone else
do not want the responsibility of determining who is right and who is wrong in any given conflict even if there is right and wrong
nor do want to keep records of all of my meetings with visitors and notes on everything we dis cussed
not kidding when tell visitors love that aspect of my job
so we have informality as an appropriate stand alone sop in that it in part explains and defines how we are different from other roles and functions in our organizations
and although it is stand alone sop we cannot practice confidentially neutrally or independently unless we are also practicing informally
believe informality to be important enough to have its own through section in standards of practice
the standards through could perhaps have their own section through
have offered my thoughts on why informality is an important sop that rightfully belongs with confidentiality neutrality and independence
let me now share what in my thinking is the down side of this sop
some of us perhaps many of us work in organizations where the human resources function is not well respected or trusted
in my organization feel very positively about hr but they are stretched to the limit and therefore cannot always do justice to their formal investigations
it is also the case as with any work situation some of our hr professionals are better than others
when refer vi si tor to hr for formal processes but do not trust that they will receive the best treatment or obtain the best result feel very very frustrated
that is not to say know what the best outcome would be or that would want to impose best but believe could do the process more justice than some of our hr professionals might
again not necessarily because of lack of skill but rather lack of resources on the part of hr
have been in an organization where did not feel as positively about our hr department as do now
journal of the international ombudsman association carolyn heard many colleagues lament the status of their hr departments and the belief throughout their organizations that hr is not to be trusted
in those situations it is incredibly hard to remain steadfast to the informality sop and to refer on to the appropriate formal resource
at the risk of blowing our own horn do believe that we om buds are often more likely to better job than the resource given our skill and knowledge as om buds
had visitor who had been given
part of that process required meeting periodically together with the supervisor and hr
it happens that the hr provider had reputation as being pro management and the visitor wanted me to participate in the monthly meetings
that likely would have been seen by the supervisor and the hr generalist as representing or advocating for the visitor
however had reason to believe that if accompanied the visitor to these sessions the hr generalist would have been more neutral and balanced
alas had to let it go as my standard practice is not to participate in formal meetings where discipline is being imposed
maintain that those that sometimes make us feel hamstrung are also extremely liberating
the more we stick to our standards the more credible and valuable we will be to our constituents and organizations as whole
journal of the international ombudsman association howard gad lin abstract this article argues that is not and was never meant to be fun da mental principle of ombudsman pr ac tice
it asserts that each of the first five standards of practice identified under and other can be covered within the core principles of independence confidentiality and tr ality
informality itself does not refer to anything that can be considered prin

the ombudsman does not make binding decisions mandate policies or formally adj udi cate issues for the organization
shared by all iterations of the om buds man concept
the article raises the concern that the widespread use of the notion of informality is associated with weak interpretation of the organizational ombudsman role one that minimizes the ombudsman ability to address issues of fairness and justice within our org ani za ti ons and dilutes our influence in identify ing and addressing systemic issues

been an ombudsman for over years now
it is interesting and somewhat dismaying to see how the notion of informality has been elevated from shorthand descriptor of our function to an ethical principle
have never been comfortable with calling informality one of the ethical principles of the ombudsman role and have never seen informality as cornerstone standard of practice for the profession
the three cornerstones independence confidentiality and neutrality problematic though they may be at times are at least principles
they refer to something we stand for and aspire to
when we assert them we announce that we will not bow to power that we can be trusted that we strive to be fair and impartial
informality is not principle it is style
one of the virtues of the organizational ombudsman role is its flexibility we do not follow fixed pro ce dures but rather can adapt our interventions to suit the issues people context interests or goals of those who come to us
in short we can take into account the unique features and circumstances of each case we are presented
but informality is hardly the right word to describe that
furthermore we would never declare flexibility to be principle of our practice rather it is one of the words that describes how we go about doing our work
so to would argue does the word
collegiate th edition dictionary defines informal as marked by the absence of formality or ceremony characteristic of or appropriate to ordinary casual or familiar use
at best it connotes lack of stuffiness which may or may not be true and at worst it connotes lack of rigor casualness
let me be clear am not arguing with the substance of the notions presented in the text about informality
am not arguing that we should conduct formal investigations or make binding si ons or be an office of record or notice or participate in adjudicative processes there is no quarrel with these ideas
understand that we need to be careful to delineate our role and to describe what journal of the international ombudsman association howard gad lin we do and proscribe what we do not do but this is different than stating principle
agree with each of the enumerated statements under the and other heading
but be lieve that every one of the first of the items listed in our standards of practice under the head ing is covered under the three primary principles
items though do not deserve to be mentioned under standards of practice but can easily be raised in discussions of best practices
frankly find it embarrassing to include these three in statement of standards of practice
so you might ask if agree with the substance why make fuss over the word
from my per spec the use of the term informal diminishes us in our own eyes not to mention eyes of those who come to us
to understand this concern need to review bit of the history of the organizational ombudsman role
there are two factors that led us collectively to focus on the notion of informal
one has to do with the protection of confidentiality and independence the other with differen ti ating the role of the organizational ombudsman from the role of classical ombudsman
the role was an adaptation of the ombudsman idea to different context than the one in which the idea originated
the classical role see gad lin et al emerged as way to give means to pursue grievances against the executive and administrative offices of the government
but citizens are not part of the government in the same way that students and teachers or employees are part of university or organization
classical ombudsmen are established by statute and have the ability to conduct fact finding investigations and to issue written reports among their essential responsibilities
furthermore classical ombudsmen are not part of the organizations for which they have responsibility
in that sense they are true outsiders
by contrast organizational ombudsmen are appointed by and are members of the organization within which they operate
why we sometime refer to ourselves as inside outsiders we are embedded in the organizations within which we function
as the organizational ombudsman role was being developed we became aware that to be true to the essential idea of independence we needed to conduct our practice differently than the classical ombudsman and to function within different structural arrangements than the classical
because the classical ombudsman is truly an outsider he or she can conduct investigations that are not expressions of power or will in other words independent investigations
in the same way reporting problem to classical ombudsman does not put on notice the organization for which the ombudsman has oversight be cause the classical ombudsman is not part of that organization
but for organizational om buds man who are typically appointed by and reporting to the top executives of the organization it was crucial for us to establish that we were not agents of management we do not act on behalf of man age ment
early on we realized that to maximize the independence of the it would be important that we not play role in formal fact finding investigations that we not be an agent of notice that we not have decision making authority and that we offer confidentiality to those who came to us for assistance
but we must keep in mind that if we understand that our organizations are complex systems from the perspective of systems theory there is no way component of system can be truly
rather when we say we are we are describing certain degree of autonomy within that system certain areas in which we have been given discretion and power to act differently than management does if in our judgment and from the responsibilities of our role we deem that appropriate
journal of the international ombudsman association howard gad lina long with independence confidentiality was another major factor in adapting the ombudsman role to the organizational context
although organizational om buds have long asserted con fid en ti ality privilege that privilege is not protected by statute
see chuck discussion in the organizational ombudsman
lacking privilege one of the ways we protect the confidential we offer to those who come to us is by forgoing certain activities that might otherwise be part of our work keeping records conducting investigations rendering binding decisions
if we do not keep records then there are no records to be subpoenaed or otherwise reviewed
similarly if we conducted formal investigations into allegations and issued reports on the basis of those inv es ti gat ions we would be hard pressed to uphold confidentiality
when the organizational om buds man was being established there was understandably considerable wariness of allowing fully confidential program within organizations
the organizations that established om buds programs allowed and supported our confidentiality only because we did not conduct full investigations and we did not issue reports of investigations and we did not make binding decisions or written re com mend at ions
all of the above mentioned activities require extensive record keeping
so in the con text of organizational ombudsman there is direct link between having confidentiality and not keeping formal records and not conducting formal investigations or fact findings
forgoing these activities was instrumental in adapting the ombudsman role to the organizational setting while preserving as best we could the three essential characteristics of the role
one of the chief proponents of this approach was ella wheat on the legendary ombudsman at uc berkeley and the department of justice
ella came from background in hr and was astute and scrupulous in differentiating the ombudsman role from roles in which one was an agent of the or ga ni zati on independence
but thinking about informality was strategic she never presented it as an ethical principle
this became strikingly clear when we ella and and several other org ani zati on al om buds do not recall who all of us were were part of the american bar association effort to bring together om buds from all sectors in order to develop common set of principles and standards of practice
interestingly our efforts to tailor the ombudsman role so that it could be effective within the context of organizations was not met with applause or even support from most of the classical ombudsmen
for many years there was disagreement and even some active antagonism between the two types of ombudsmen
the aba initiative was an attempt to support the ombudsman idea and to find common ground between what had become the two major types of ombudsman
those meetings which went on for almost two years as recall were difficult and often contentious
one of the main points of disagreement was about whether conducting investigations into grievance and complaints was an essential feature of the ombudsman role
many of the classical om buds believed and still do believe that organizational om buds are pretenders wanna bes in the words of larry hill one of the more vociferous advocates of that position he was law professor not actually an om buds himself
for those folks there were two key features that organizational om buds lacked the ability to investigate and true independence which they saw as coming by being established by statute and reporting to somebody or persons not part of the organization in which they served as om buds
from their perspective without those features the organizational om buds position can not be considered ombudsman role
journal of the international ombudsman association howard gad linin those discussions there was never an assertion or affirmation of informality as principle
rather there was the assertion of boundary between the om buds and the organization in which the om buds serves
for the organizational om buds the boundary is defined in part by the activities and functions the does not take on the does not serve as an agent of the organization does not conduct formal investigations does not have decision making power and does not ac ce pt notice
this boundary is drawn in the service of honoring the principles of the ombudsman role confidentiality neutrality impartiality and independence
carolyn st ie ber one of the ne ers in the world of the academic ombudsman tried to capture the underlying similarities across the different varieties of ombudsman when she threads run through the conceptual fabric of every office aim to humanize administration to support fairness accountability and equity
all ombudsmen can be approached in confidence
no ombudsman has enforcement or disciplinary powers
all depend on the power of persuasion as well as the cre dib il of the office which leads individuals to trust it
although the process in achieving objectives of fairness and accountability may differ the product is the same chance for the ordinary people those without power or prestige to be heard and to get fair treatment
varieties has the ombudsman concept become diluted
certainly it makes sense to state in our establishing documents terms of reference charter etc
the processes by which we perform our work and to state explicitly the functions we do not per form but processes and functions are not principles
in addition believe that underneath the dis cuss ion of informality lies another issue that is the question of whether or not ombudsman should have power and influence within their organization
fear that the thinking behind this stance reflects an assumption that having influence in an organization is the same as having formal power and authority and that being neutral means never passing judgment or coming to conclusion
very often at meetings and in discussion hear an have power we just help people explore sensibility which is to my mind denial of the fundamental importance commitment to and procedural justice which is at the heart of the ombudsman role
the rejection of decision making authority and investigative powers has over time evolved into frighteningly passive interpretation of neutrality one that eschews influence in any form
criticize we advise we suggest we evaluate we investigate has become kind of mantra for some of us
without discussing each of these in detail let me simply ask since we assert ombudsman exercises sole discretion over whether or how to act regard ing an concerns trend or concerns of multiple individuals over how else can that discretion be exercised without evaluation
would argue that if we look carefully at each of the we would find that we actually perform and should perform all of those functions but in uniquely ombudsman like way
but that is topic for another paper
journal of the international ombudsman association howard gad lin my worry is that the more passive interpretation of the ombudsman role leads to ombudsman programs that are merely mid level complaint departments blended with counseling programs that specialize in understanding organizational policies resources dynamics politics and policies
from this perspective all we can do is help people identify and explore options for addressing the issues people bring to us for help and observe and report trends in issues and bring them to the attention of management
contrary to this orientation believe that an ombudsman should be and should aspire to be one of the most influential people in the organization
her his per spec should be sought by wide range of the members participants in the organization
cal ly the ombudsman should be someone who people from throughout the organization consult when facing complex potentially conflict laden or volatile situations and problems whether it be early in the development of such problems or at the point at which efforts at managing them seem to be failing
furthermore agree completely with carolyn st ie ber that our role must include supporting ness accountability and and that we must provide chance for the ordinary people those without power or prestige to be heard and to get fair treatment
to fulfill that role we need to be able to reach conclusions and make judgments not in the formal way grievance panel reaches decision or top administrator makes final judgment that policy or procedure was properly administered but as an ombudsman to whom people often come with the questions this fair
please note am not saying we should then issue judgment or directly answer that question in or manner but we should look into that and assess that situation and that assess ment should inform and guide our subsequent actions
many will ask if something we are investigating it in the sense of conducting
but there are many issues that come to an ombudsman that have nothing to do with formal procedures rules and policies but that still raise questions of fairness and equity
those issues involve finding facts so much as it requires gathering multiple perspectives exploring motivations and exam in ing interpersonal and group dynamics and providing feedback in balanced and unbiased way about what we have discovered
sometimes in the course of situation we discover systemic problems policies procedures practices or even norms and values that are exacerbating tensions eliciting conflicts or contributing to organizational dysfunction
the mere act of identifying something as problem involves making judgments and coming to conclusions
conducting and reporting the results of such are an essential part of providing systemic feedback and providing systemic feedback we have long asserted is an essential part of the role
honestly believe that if we are not performing these roles then we ought not to be calling ourselves ombudsman
mind you see all of these ombudsman responsibilities as carried out within the framework pro by the principle of confidentiality independence and neutrality not in violation of them
this framework is what differentiates us from those with official managerial responsibilities and creates the basis for us to be influential in totally unique way
calling informality one of our principles gives us nothing and diminishes our potential contribution to the organizations in which we serve
journal of the international ombudsman association om standards of practice guide om buds in our day today case work and provide solid explanation to help understand the om buds role and how it differs from other roles in our org ani za ti ons
but they also guide us in evaluating and communicating about non case re lated invitations and requests that while appropriate and commonplace for others are inappropriate for om buds
most of us who serve in organizational om buds roles are employees in educational corporate health care and nongovernmental organizations as well as governmental and inter governmental agencies
but unlike other employees in these organizations we follow the in terna ti on al ombudsman standards of practice
these standards create unique role that is different from that of other employees particularly those in management roles
it is our responsibility to understand and educate our employers and constituents how these standards apply to our case work
wisely the standards also anticipate and provide guidance about numerous non case related matters that are likely to arise simply because we are members of our organizations especially if we are trusted
if the choices we must make about these mat te rs could later limit our ability perceived or real to effectively practice to the standards it is our responsibility to recognize this and to educate our employers and constituents about it
for an organizational om buds responding to some requests that would be completely appropriate for other employees sometimes requires saying no
inappropriate requests journal of the international ombudsman association om helped many constituents to understand just how differently an om buds operates from others within an organization
finally will describe how responded to organizational leaders who on several occasions made well intentioned but inappropriate invitations for me to engage in ac ti vi ties which believed might have unnecessarily placed me in of situation with respect to the standard on neutrality
my employer understands that my case work decisions and actions are guided by standards of practice
this is largely because in the chancellor our campus sent me an zati on for om buds memo which indicated his expectation that our office follow the standards of practice peters on
although it is very unlikely most constituents have even heard of the international ombudsman association let alone our standards of practice most seem to arrive with some degree of understanding of my role
typically ask visitors if they have been to the om buds office previously unless know they have
if they say they have not make an opening statement of some kind in which explain my role and how operate ie following the standards of practice
most seem to expect that will treat their conversations with me as confidential
and most seem to know that my role is designated as and as result will not advocate for one person against another in any dispute
many do not know until explain it that with respect to my case work the standard regarding independence means that my supervisor does not tell me what to do or ask me to reveal the identity of anyone have seen
this seems to reassure visitors that will indeed maintain confidentiality
many constituents have been less aware of how following the standard on informality will affect the ways in which can assist them
often explain that will listen to their concerns help them identify range of options to address them and engage them in evaluating the pros and cons of the options
although everyone has appeared to understand and accept this explanation for many people it is when contrast what do not do as an om buds with what those in manage ment roles often must do that see the proverbial of recognition on their faces
this occurs when explain that as an om buds in addition to not giving legal advice do not accept formal notice for the organization about problem eg discrimination or harassment arbitrate adjudicate or formally investigate complaints make official determinations for the organization about violations of rights performance failures or who was right or wrong in given situation maintain written records on behalf of the organization participate in let alone administer formal procedures such as grievances hearings disciplinary proceedings or appeals sanction anyone or meet with people who do not want to meet with me
when constituents hear all of this especially in combination with the explanation of what the other standards mean about how operate they invariably recognize my role as very unusual one within the organization and they often appear comforted by this knowledge
on several occasions have realized that leaders in my organization did not recognize how follow ing standards of practice not only guided my case related choices and actions they guided many non case related ones as well
perhaps it was inevitable that would eventually receive and need to decline invitations to participate in activities that are commonplace for other journal of the international ombudsman association om se bo km embers of the organization
may have been the only person who ever declined an invitation by the chancellor our campus to provide written feedback about the performance of vice chancellor during the annual evaluation process
viewed this invitation as evidence was trusted by the chancellor who was at the time my direct supervisor
also when was asked several times by different campus leaders to serve on search committees could always understand why had been invited
in one example the university was hiring person to formally investigate com plaints about faculty misconduct
in another new director was being hired to lead the campus restorative justice program one philosophically aligned with my own role as an alternative dispute resolution practitioner
unlike others asked to provide written feedback about vice performance or to serve on search committees explained to the chancellor that the standard of practice on neutrality and impartiality required me to
serve in no additional role within the organization which would compromise my neutrality
by contrast providing written feedback for use in the formal evaluation of an officer would require abandoning neutrality and stating personal opinions
further as others have acknowledged gad lin and pino if the information about which my opinions were based came from my involvement in case in which had promised the vice chan cell or confidentiality the standard on confidentiality could easily be violated as well
and the document elaborating on neutrality and impartiality and on informal explains that in the administrative capacity as manager of the ombudsman office the ombudsman should not participate in formal management functions
the annual evaluation process of course is one of the most formal of all management functions
it can result in raises and promotions or employee discipline including termination
the best practices elaboration of standard on neutrality cautions specifically against serving
as voting member on search committee other than for ombudsman staff
chose not to participate even as nonvoting member because recognized future possible conflict of in ter est or at least possible perception that had one if an ultimately unsuccessful candidate came to see me later in the om buds office about suspicion of unfairness in the process
the standards on informality not participating in formal management functions and neutral avoiding conflicts of interest and perceptions of them combined to provide strong reasons to decline all of these requests
believe the fact that could cite both of these standards as well as the best practices elaboration as the rationale for declining these invitations helped those offering the invitations to understand why needed to do so
and it reminded them of how the standards affect my decision making as an om buds even in matters not related to my case work
misunderstandings by those in management roles about reasons om buds cannot do what others routinely do is apparently not an unusual phenomenon
remember conversation number of years ago with relatively new om buds colleague who succeeded an om buds with many years of experience will call not his real name
she relayed conversation with someone journal of the international ombudsman association om se bo kin human resources hr in which she had explained that she would not be able to participate in some activity the hr person assumed would be happening in the near future
my colleague laughed when she described the hr immediate response is this another one of those gary ham lin things
she explained to the hr person that indeed it was the same decision gary would have made although the reasons for making it were not unique to gary but rather root ed in the standards of practice of at that time the university and college om buds association
when think back to my early days as an organizational om buds am astounded that man aged to function with no standards of practice
when two previous om buds organizations devel oped standards in the mid to late as profession believe we found firmer footing
the standards of practice and best practices document have added to this progress
this unique combination of standards sets organizational om buds apart from all others inside and outside of our organizations
they clarify the role for practitioners constituents and our organizations
and together they provide rationale for courts and hopefully for lawmakers to someday recognize that we deserve legal privilege guaranteeing us the right to practice with confidentiality

organizational ombudsman solo pr ac ti
mary ro we when was first appointed in often felt lonely even though liked my job
will try to ex plain why liked my job and why felt alone
my initial job description was to see if could make human beings more at mit
really liked this concept and challenge and opp or tu
the job description was major reason why accepted the job
also was content with the structure of the job was happy to be formally instructed by my first bosses the president and chancellor of mit to keep near absolute confidentiality and to serve independently from all line and staff structures
also was wryly relieved to learn that would have no managerial decision making power since knew so little about the job for this reason practicing also came easily
she owes special debt to to ni robinson clarence williams and thomas her mit om buds office colleagues of the present and past
brian blo ch is indebted to arnold zack for introducing him to the om buds profession and to mary ro we who has served as mentor for over de cade
as with mary brian has gained so much through his work with the tors associate editors david miller alan lincoln laurie patters on and tom
finally bob cohen codirector at is kc on resolve has been tremendously insightful colleague
journal of the international ombudsman association mary ro we and brian blo ch however quickly found that human beings more is not an easy task let alone for just one person
found that my skills such as they were if any were only those of single human being
most people at mit were male most were caucasian but some were not some were born outside the us all the great religions were represented each with its own spectrum of differences
the first language for many appeared to be mathematics
what did know about all the points of view of all humans
in addition was not yet formally designated as neutral but quickly learned that was ex pe ct ed to be impartial
learned this when gave my new boss an overview of the point of view of woman who had come to my office
my note was completely factual as description of her point of view
prided myself on my appearance of objectivity
new boss wanted to know the other side of the story
what does it actually mean to the experience of another person when each of us has been socialized into just one set of demographics how would learn to understand all points of view
in my first months on the job asked for counterpart preferably man and preferably someone of color
and began to collect ideas about solo practice vs
hav ing colleague in om buds practice
in the event over forty years it has been much easier for me to work together with succession of extraordinary colleagues than it has been when have practiced alone
it seems to me obvious that large institutions need more than one organizational ombudsman practitioner if possible
it provides the possibility of gender and race diversity not to men ti on diversity by age religion nationality language experience and different pockets of wisdom
each is likely to have his or her own network of helping resources and inside and outside colleagues whose wisdom can be consulted
the office will have more than one set of skills for coaching and training and case analysis
means that our visitors have choice of practitioner which adds meaning to the idea of having options in the om buds office
quickly learned that having colleague provides backup for vacations and illness and less burden on the family of the practitioner
having colleague provides failsafe in an emer gen cy
having an colleague helps to prevent burnout by providing gallows humor and consistent encouragement
one of the quintessential values of an is responsiveness in universe where instant response is desired because of the internet
responsiveness is also important since many helping ser vices and managers are so slow to respond
immediate responsiveness may also actually be needed in serious situations by managers as well as by employees and students
two oos can provide much more responsiveness
two oos plus an assistant who is in charge of the calendar who also can move appointments can make sure that most callers are acknowledged within day
this emergency room responsiveness which matters so much to those whom we serve almost certainly saves money for our employers in serious cases
journal of the international ombudsman association mary ro we and brian blo ch having more than one om bud helps lot in communicating about the office
inevitably the caseload depends in part on word of mouth
the out reach of people who people who called the spreads much faster where there is more than one practitioner
in addition there is some evidence that different om buds different kinds of cases
this is not just matter of demographics eg women visitors who think they prefer to see an or man
one will perhaps without really noticing it become bit of specialist in disability cases or high maintenance superstar cases or with respect to intellectual property problems or with very complex multi issue cross boundary cases with multiple cohorts
then the mysterious word of mouth will bring that practitioner many more of those cases
having these different lines of practice helps to deepen and widen the outreach of the office and also to spread skills between or among the oos
obviously one wonderful gift for any om bud is having someone with whom to consult on case
this can be incredibly important where facts are missing or mutually contradictory or where there are no relevant policies or policies that are mutually contradictory which is com mon circumstance in an office and the individual has to rely on his or her own ju dg ment
talking with colleague helps to support efforts in maintaining neutrality
having colleague also helps to protect om buds confidentiality
om buds will breach confidentiality in time of imminent danger
an colleague can help in making critical decisions and may see alternatives other than breaching confidentiality
working with another person in the office means there can be less stress on each practitioner to practice well
om buds are among the few people in any large organization who and hear from an entire organization
having more than one person learning about the organization collecting in forma ti on and working on systems change greatly increases the range of information and wisdom that the office can develop about how the organization works
and about how the whole con management system could work better
as with any profession an om bud needs to keep learning
having colleague means that one has an on site teaching partner
the other sees things differently asks different questions finds different situations humorous and comes up with new options and does so all the time
different oos interpret the office statistics differently and see different kinds of ways to help system to do better
looking back remember vividly many essentials of om buds practice that have learned from my close colleagues reciting even short list would take many pages
my present and erstwhile colleagues are probably even more aware of what they have tried to teach me that still need to learn
in writing this am also very aware of all have learned from colleagues in other org ani za ti ons
about discovered that there were other institutions with om buds
will never forget what it meant to discover that was not alone
journal of the international ombudsman association mary ro we and brian blo ch oos from the midwest om buds group california caucus of college and university om buds university and college om buds association corporate ombudsman association the om buds man association international ombudsman association association of canadian college and university ombudsmen east coast om buds group and many oos around the world have been very generous with wisdom and support and with specific skills training and ideas
am very grateful not to have had to practice altogether alone since even in the years when my organization had just one om bud
brian blo ch while agree wholeheartedly with mary analysis above we as om buds are used to help ing visitors look at all sides of situation
in that mood offer some possible down sides to the multiple om buds office
although an organizational ombudsman does not have decision making role in the org ani za ti on they certainly make many decisions about their work
collaborating with colleague can make decisions better
it can also take longer and even lead to internal conflicts if the om buds agree on particular decision or even more generally on the mission of the office
we know that om buds have varying ways of practicing their profession
some place more emphasis on addressing systemic change than others
some can be quite directive while others are strictly facilitative
some om buds mix more with management than others
additionally it is only natural that one om bud will have different personality traits than their coom bud
while this can lead to highly effective om buds office it can also create challenges if the om buds dif fer with each other on serious matters
the web site includes several articles about how to communicate the effectiveness and use fulness of an om buds office
however it remains challenge to demonstrate the ongoing value of the office
this task becomes even more challenging if solo om bud asks for an additional om bud with the budgetary requirements that entails
many organizations have only enough money for one om bud
ro we convincingly points out the various merits of having colleague with whom to consult
while it is not the same as having fulltime colleague she also mentions that om buds are very willing to give time to their fellow om buds in other organizations
this is one of the great ben ef its of being in the om buds profession
for the many years ran solo office estimate that an nu ally shared over em ails with fellow om buds who listened offered advice and in general allowed me to develop in this profession
the need for spending time with likeminded om buds whether you are in an ideal situation with are there is real need for regular association with likeminded oos
was reminded of this recently when the editors of this journal had robust email exchange about compassion fatigue and its role in the life of an
we compiled list of its symptoms as well as list of its causes
we then turned to practical ways to address an compassion fatigue
at the top of the list was colleague or significant other to talk to while remaining within the bound aries of
additionally we listed at our other options what might we have done differently and thinking out loud with colleague about
we also mentioned up on the profession and studying best which is another way of ing with colleagues
being able regularly to share thoughts and experiences with colleagues is invaluable
we can be affected by self doubt
we struggle to remain neutral when party is acting inappropriately
our patience and comp as sion are put to the test especially when we deal with complaining visitors who are
we are often exposed to the worst parts of the organization we work with
we may struggle with emotional fatigue and depersonalization
the wisdom reassurance guidance and friendship of fellow oos is necessity for oos who want to remain effective in their work and balanced in their life
journal of the international ombudsman association mary rudolph and melissa con nell abstract the act of mentor ing dates back to ancient greece and continues to evolve based on the community involved
in this article the mission of the mentor ing program as well as history and matching process of seasoned mentors with in ex peri enc ed men tees are discussed
there are numerous ways to share information about particular topic
for example when learning how to bake the perfect apple pie one can attempt to follow the instructions passed down to each generation ie pour in handful of sugar and pinch of salt
or choose to utilize our most advanced technology you tube and watch short video by renowned chef with each step visually and verbally described in utmost detail
either way it is the hope that the baker will end up with dessert suitable for serving to the family
in this article the authors have chosen to blend number of styles together to produce well rounded and informative essay about the mentor ing program
starting with an interview with the founder vicky brown the reader learns about the history and reasoning behind the program
following the interview is insight into the benefits matching process and development of mentors
concluding is brief exploration into the various types of om buds the mentor ing program hopes to serve
the reader will also note antidotal quotes from previous men tees that have utilized an mentor sprinkled throughout the article
it is with intention that several viewpoints and aspects of men to ring are shared for complete and thorough understanding of this program
to continue to expand and develop pro cesses for the growing om buds com mu
lastly the relevance of the men to ring program and the benefits it offers to an array of constituents individually and institutionally are examined
ombudsman association journal of the international ombudsman association mary rudolph and melissa con nell history of the mentor ing program founded in spend an afternoon chatting with recently retired university of central florida om buds vicky brown about the mentor ing program and hear the following was always my learned as much being mentor as being and never met anyone
fondly referred to as the founder and heart of the mentor ing program vicky warmly recalls the early years the many om buds that mentor ed her along the way and her strong con vi ct ions regarding the importance of mentor ing new om buds
as vicky shares her memories of the creation of the first mentor ing committee for the university and college om buds association she wants to make sure that mailie sai gen retired om buds from the university of iowa is given full credit for being the founder of the program
the program though small in the beginning was personal to vicky because she herself had struggled in the beginning of her om buds career
she goes on to tell the story of her first om buds conference in chicago in left the first session of the conference crying
thought know any and going to do this wrong
had it not been for kay peters beautiful lady taking me under her wing would have gone home ready to resign
kay stayed with me the whole three days at the conference
she would be waiting for me after sessions and kept telling me everything would be okay
why it is so important to make person feel welcome and do it
vicky then starts listing all the om buds who helped her throughout her career but particularly that first year marsha mailie judy tom mary claudia marvin
there must have been twenty om buds
when and the ombudsman association toa merged vicky decided to run for the board and as part of her nomination statement mentioned the importance of making new members feel included welcomed and informed
although the mentor ing program was set aside for while she and marvin neal who she describes as wonderful wonderful role model for om buds and human agreed to cochair the first mentor ing program
using the program as guideline they tweaked some of the information and sent out an initial email to all members
within very short time the program had eighteen men tees and twenty two mentors from all over the world including australia singapore canada and the united states

the mentor ing program may be especially helpful to solo practitioners who do not have the benefit of an experienced colleague to guide them through the murky waters of om buds work
the mentor ing program committee connects novice ombudsman with an experienced ombudsman defined as practicing ombudsman with at least three years of experience
this personal relationship provides the new ombudsman an opportunity to consult with some one regarding setting up an office and discuss cases and issues affecting the profession
this relationship is somewhat formalized thus sparing the new ombudsman the awkwardness of continually relying on the kindness of semi strangers to consult about often difficult issues that arise for new ombudsman
case can be made that the international ombudsman association is learning community
learning community is group in which members are encouraged to observe practice and share experience methods and strategies towards common activity or goal
peters on the phrase is mostly used in books and articles directed at novice teach ers to remind them that community that supports and encourages learning must be intentional
journal of the international ombudsman association mary rudolph and melissa con nell constructivist theory suggests that learning is not passive activity like water flowing into bucket but is an activity that depends upon the relationship between the learner and his or her environment

we need to listen to how others interpret our meaning in order to deepen our own

in life in crowded place making learning community peters on describes ceremony and ritual celebration conversation and play as components of learning community
other components of learning community are shared agreements shared experiences and shared language
the international ombudsman association provides so many of these components
the annual conference provides ritual and celebration and play ask anyone who attended the line dancing session in houston
the social events hosted by provide opportunities for members to get to know each other and foster level of comfort and inclusion which is vital to facilitating space where we can fumble ask questions and make mistakes during our conference general sessions

one of the areas where she truly helps me is when the office or are getting drawn into some thing that is really not appropriate for us and my gut tells me that but am struggling to find the words to explain it
she breaks things down for me very clearly by referring to the standards and the code of ethics
sh re ya tr ive di university om buds officer journal of the international ombudsman association mary rudolph and melissa con nell the mentor ing program is vital component of the learning community because it pro vi des for continuous learning by allowing the ment ee the opportunity to discuss real case and it allows the new real life work experience to enter the dialogue

ken za hor ski university ombudsman the benefits of the mentor ing program are not only for the ment ee
mentor ing someone new to the profession offers the unique opportunity to reaffirm the core values and share ex peri enc es and lessons learned in the process
the mentor ing program can also serve as feedback loop to the professional development committee providing information about the types of questions challenges and assistance requested from men tees which can be incorporated into training
matching process the matching of ment ee to mentor begins with an member filling out request form international ombudsman association

ment ee must be practicing ombudsman with less than one year experience in order to meet the necessary criteria for match
the mentor must be practicing ombudsman with at least three years experience with either member or ate member designation
information gathered from the request form includes what type of organization the ment ee works for ie academic corporate government etc
the size of the organization preferred lan gu age and geographic region
there is also section which allows the applicant to include any additional information which may be useful in determining the appropriate match
journal of the international ombudsman association mary rudolph and melissa con nell once the information is received by and the data is confirmed the mentor ing com mit tee gets to work to make match as soon as possible
members of the committee schedule monthly phone conferences to receive the latest requests review the list of potential mentors and discuss possible matches based on the information listed in the application
the ment ee mentor match is for one year commitment although many relationships continue long after the months and therefore the committee tries to ensure solid selections
each committee member agrees to contact portion of the new applicants shortly after the phone conference
one to welcome the applicant to and answer any initial questions and two to let them know that the committee has received their ap plica ti on and is attempting to find mentor for them
soon after the contact has been made with the applicant member of the committee will contact possible mentor to see if it is still good time for them to mentor
if the answer is yes he she will be informed that there is request for mentor
the committee member will review the mentor ing obligations provide guidance and confirm that the mentor is willing and able to take on the responsibility
if the experienced ombudsman agrees to mentor the committee member forwards this information on to

felt real loss when my mentorship expired
the mentorship program was valuable resource for me in many ways
charm aine faculty om buds the concept of has been around for ages since at least the times of ancient greece
it has entailed the communication of knowledge from more experienced person to less experienced person with the goal of assisting the less experienced person to develop pro fess ion ally
the mission and process of the mentor ing program is not much different than the mission and process of mentor ing from ancient greece but perhaps it should grow and develop just as we expect from our men tees
there are many ways in which the program can expand and develop all dependent on the time and energy that member volunteers can devote to the program
the following section outlines some possible directions for the mentor ing program
journal of the international ombudsman association mary rudolph and melissa con nell development of mentors as evidenced by testimonials sprinkled throughout this article many men tees have had won experiences with their mentors
but we hear from everyone and once in while we hear that particular match going so well
when this occurs we attempt to match the men tee up with different mentor
the rapport the mentor and ment ee develop is very important perhaps the most important indicator of success of the mentor ing relationship and when rapport does not develop between the mentor and ment ee the match is not successful
currently the mentor ing program leaves the mentor and ment ee to work their relationship out themselves as well as the process for the mentor ing and the content
this leaves much to chance and we feel we can do more to assist the mentor to improve chances of success of the mentor ing relationship
the mentor ing program has discussed the following ideas for assisting mentors
suggest that the mentor and ment ee share information about themselves during their first meeting ie educational and career background current om buds situation and constituents greatest challenges as new om buds family situation experience with etc
provide tools possibly checklists to assist the mentors conduct case review reflection with ment ee
provide timely topics of discussion for mentor ing meetings such as list serv topics news ries covered in the bl og and upcoming events like the conference or professional devel op ment opportunities
the mentor ing committee can also learn what research tells us about the factors that con tribute to the success of the mentor ing relationship so that we can better assist mentors and men tees
aspiring ombudsman ao san increasing number of requests the mentor ing program committee receives is from aspiring ombudsmen who are interested in receiving mentor who will talk with them about the profession and suggest strategies for finding an ombudsman position
assisting find po si ti on is not the purpose of the mentor ing program so we have not made this type of request priority and have not assisted these other than offering some information when we speak with the ao
journal of the international ombudsman association mary rudolph and melissa con nell as educational programs in the field of conflict management and grow and more people learn of the profession it is likely these types of requests will continue to grow
an option the mentor ing program committee would like to offer ao members is one or two con vers at ions with an ombudsman an ombudsman who is new to the profession may be the ideal to discuss strategies and provide information about the profession
another request the mentor ing program committee is receiving comes from consulting om buds men who wish to be connected with mentor
the needs of consulting ombudsmen are broader than discussions of cases and issues that arise in the profession
consulting om buds men are interested in receiving mentor to discuss marketing and setting up practice as well as discussing the challenges and opportunities when working as an ombudsman for an org ani zati on outside of that organization
the mentor ing program committee members would like to be in position to facilitate con versation between novice consulting ombudsman and an experienced consulting om buds man
the challenge here is the limited number of experienced consulting ombudsmen to place as mentor
the mentor ing program committee strives to find mentor for all practicing ombudsmen so it is always difficult when member meets all the criteria to receive mentor and we have mentor to meet their needs
never in the history of the united states have there been so many generations ie traditional is ts born before baby boomers born between and generation born between and and millennia ls born between and working side by side
me is ter and will yerd discuss some of the workplace challenges and opportunities created by these multiple generations eg different expectations career needs communication styles and learning preferences all needing to be managed to engage and retain all employees
me is ter and will yerd state that millenia ls the newest additions to the workforce enjoy coach ing and not surprise given that millennia ls are very social
new forms of mentor ing are being created to suit their styles and preferences
in respect to communication millennia ls want information that is relevant to themselves and to their own role also making mentor ing preferable mode of learning
millennia ls are seam less ly connected to technology and they enjoy constant communication me is ter and will yerd
mentor ing programs are being developed that combine many of these characteristics to make them more effective and desirable to millennia ls
journal of the international ombudsman association mary rudolph and melissa conn ella model referred to as mosaic mentor ing connects the ment ee with multiple eg five or more experienced people
to engage millennia ls coaching may occur via the internet rather than through telephone or in person meetings
ment ee could email question or concern to multiple mentors say five and it is likely that with this many mentors one of the mentors could email the ment ee back immediately with feedback referred to as mentor ing
with this model challenge for om buds may be the risk to confidentiality when questions and answers are submitted via the internet but could likely be solved by technol savvy om buds or technology expert
another model for mentor ing is called or learning circles
group mentor ing is the opposite of mosaic mentor ing
in group mentor ing one experienced ombudsman provides mentor ing to many novice ombudsman via the internet
this model allows one mentor to tate an online mentor ing relationship with men tees and between men tees
this may also be very effective model as we all may recall getting most information from our peers perhaps because we are less inhibited about asking questions and presenting concerns
an additional benefit of this type of mentor ing is that these learning circles may continue well past year the time frame the mentor ing relationship currently lasts
we have had men tees state that they felt real loss when the mentor ing year expired and they no longer felt comfortable contacting the mentor
we know that mentor ing may be most valuable to the sole practitioners so these new models of mentor ing may benefit the sole practitioner as well as the younger generation of om buds
conclusion under superb mentor ing was able once again to see the value of mentorship but this time from the other side
please keep this program going at believe it is one of the most appealing and helpful services the organization provides
ken za hor ski university ombudsman the opportunity to tell the story past present and future of the mentor ing program is much appreciated
the mentor ing program may be most valuable to the sole practitioner so it is very appropriate that this story is told in an edition of the journal devoted to this pop ula ti on within our community
we acknowledge vicky brown for her commitment to the mentor ing program and thank all of the mentor ing program committee volunteers
we also thank the official mentors and the countless number of unofficial mentors who have taken many of us under their wings and played very important role in our professional growth and development

he in em ann journal of the international ombudsman association frank fowl ie and chris la hatte abstr acta feature of an ombudsman is the ap pointment for fixed term of years or inevitable retirement from the office for the usual reasons of age or change
in there must be transition from the incumbent to the new appointee
this paper examines the process based on the actual transition within sole pr act it io office and evaluates the transition process along with lessons learned commentary
introduction the idea for the study came from the transition of dr frank fowl ie the former internet corpora ti on for assigned names and numbers ic ann ombudsman to chris la hatte newly appointed by the ic ann board in july
dr fowl ie was the founding ombudsman and had been ap pointed in
he had continued in office until february when his term of appointment ended
in the period following dr departure herb wa ye who had acted as the adjunct ombudsman acted as the interim ombudsman
the ic ann ombudsman is regarded as an executive ombudsman
the ic ann office of the ombudsman like many ombudsman operations across the world is sole practitioner shop
while herb wa ye acted as the adjunct ombudsman under dr fowl ie and continues to do so for chris his role is to act as backup resource and he is not involved in the day to day operations of dispute resolution within ic ann
knowledge transfer successor induction journal of the international ombudsman association frank fowl ie and chris la hatte before the hiring of the new ombudsman both the office of the ombudsman and the ic ann organization faced serious issues about the hand over of knowledge and information from one to the other
it was incorporated under the clinton administration to man age the domain name system as nongovernmental organization and sits at the very hub of the internet
the company is not for profit enterprise set up under california law
members of the board of directors are selected through process of selection from nominating com mit tee and by election through various bodies
ic ann stake holders come from very diverse range of governmental corporate not for profit and individual groups and ic ann has multi stakeholder governance model
there is very conscious drive to internationalise the company and despite the united states origin the stake holders are truly international
the corporate culture therefore and the stakeholder culture both must recognise the international nature of the organisation and the respect and recognition of diversity of race culture and opinion
there was heretofore no established precedent or procedure for organising the ombudsman transition within the organisation
dr fowl ie had come from background rich with experience in dispute resolution services and offices of canadian ombudsman and chris la hatte came from legal background with practice as barrister and mediator
he had no prior experience as an ombudsman
to give further background brief biographies are footnoted
there were additional challenges to the transition because the ic ann head office is located in angeles california and dr fowl ie resides in british columbia canada and chris la hatte resides in wellington new zealand
after chris la hatte was appointed they had number of discussions about how to achieve the transition and agreed that the appropriate place to do so was at the headquarters of ic ann in marina del suburb of angeles
there were some obvious issues about learning how to achieve the transition for the role
for example case management system is used to run the office of the ombudsman cases ic ann has its own knowledge management systems and ic ann itself is complex multi stakeholder organisation
in addition while chris la hatte has long background in law and mediation he is novice ombudsman and needed guidance and training for the role and where to obtain further training as needed
dr fowl ie therefore developed plan to develop such training and an introduction to ic ann in conjunction with the human relations director and other senior staff at ic ann
the training plan therefore needed to take into account both knowledge transfer and guid an ce as to where information and training could be obtained
in developing the plan dr fowl ie needed to be aware that at the time of drafting the plan he did not know the gaps in knowledge
so the plan needed to be flexible and take into account the need to identify the gaps and the appropriate way to provide the specific training as well is the more general overall introduction to the organization and its business
journal of the international ombudsman association frank fowl ie and chris la hatte the transition of knowledge from one ombudsman to the successor it is likely that the records of an internet based ombudsman will be kept in some sort of file management system which also means that there will be substantial electronic records
if the ombudsman is moving into an organisation it goes without saying that new ombudsman will need training in any new or particular programs used by the organisation and of course access to any online databases
there will of course be certain amount of paper files and there is need to explain how they are organised and the filing system
the needs of both ombudsmen in the transfer process dr fowl ie invested many years on the original setup and creation of the office
therefore he had personal interest to ensure that his work was continued and built upon by his successor
chris la hatte as novice ombudsman required as much training as was possible and guidance as to the further training opportunities he should look for both in the transition stage and beyond
there needed to be an efficient transfer of knowledge but there was also an acknowledgment that there was relatively limited amount of time to achieve this
the transition training there fore needed to be intensive and cover extensive amounts of information
consideration of organizational needs ic ann wanted an efficient transfer of the work of the office so that chris la hatte could com men ce his ombudsman work as quickly as possible
it was important therefore to work closely with the human relations director who normally handles the intake of new staff at executive level and assist with meeting key personnel to brief chris la hatte on ic ann and its operations
the management of the transition dr fowl ie prepared for the transition by drafting training and meeting schedule
he prepared the draft in conjunction with the ic ann human relations director steven anton off who assist ed with resources and liaison with staff members who would train chris la hatte in aspects of the organization and its business
they considered such schedule essential so that the actual hand over could be completed in personal fashion
the schedule involved listing and liaising with key personnel so that there could be meetings with dr fowl ie and chris la hatte to discuss the various functions within the organisation and how the transition would affect all of them
it also involved training in administrative matters such as the budget process and the arrange men ts for expenses travel and other usual employment matters
other key personnel reflected the multi stakeholder model of ic ann so that chris la hatte could be introduced to the key players within the various pillars of the organisation
typical example was that of compliance journal of the international ombudsman association frank fowl ie and chris la hatte who administer the registrars and the key registrar accreditation agreement and who man age contractual compliance with the registrars concerning the agreement
historically this has been fruitful area for complaints to the ombudsman
issues in relation to continuing role and protection of role in transition when there is change in the office of an ombudsman there needs to be clear process for appointment of the replacement
the office itself may be seen to be vulnerable during this period as during the transition period the outgoing officeholder may be seen as toothless and the new appointee may be adjusting to the environment and becoming familiar with the com munity which he or she serves
an organisational or executive ombudsman may be particularly at risk if there are political moves to adjust the terms of service or the appointment
there must be transparent and open process but also one which takes into account the vulnerabilities referred to
the credibility of the office may be affected during the transition period and it is important therefore to have continuous service available
this article is written from the perspectives of both ombudsmen and our hope is that our ex peri enc es will be of benefit to other ombudsmen operations as they look at ways to construct smooth and beneficial hand overs
frank fowl ie chris la hatte got it right when he talked about personal investment in the office of the om buds man and my desire to set the next ombudsman up for success in his role
when started as the ic ann ombudsman the office was really nothing more than bylaw and batch of ideas
in an international organization such as ic ann participants stake holders and staff come from across the world with varying views on governance and in particular on oversight mechanisms such as the ombudsman
some wanted the ic ann ombudsman to be like an inspector general who was implicated in almost every aspect of the business while others thought the role should be complaint registry only able to tell management or the board of di rec tors about the existence of an issue but unable to do anything about it
over time the office produced an ombudsman framework and results based accountability framework which provided context for the operations in an model
the board of directors ratified these documents and set the course for the ombudsman to receive complaints use alternative dispute resolution tools to seek positive outcomes to investigate maladministration and to make recommendations for change
it was very much proper ex ec ut ive ombudsman operation
journal of the international ombudsman association frank fowl ie and chris la hatte however one factor made this unique operation
the ic ann ombudsman is an shop in global organization that by its very definition worked in technology based or on line world
the office of the ombudsman therefore had to be virtual one and the first of its kind
while the office built itself into an ombudsman institution it also had to create itself in the world of online dispute resolution
was fortunate to be quickly accepted into the community and the office enjoyed great relationship with the national centre for technology and dispute resolution at the university of massachusetts am her st
as with any business entity with long experience the ic ann office of the ombudsman built relationships with many others
these ranged from the ic ann staff in particular the corporate secretary john jeffrey to government officials ombudsman associations service providers individual community member to special relationships such as the strauss centre for dispute resolution at pepper dine university
with respect to the latter the office of the ombudsman had acted as an externship host to over masters of conflict resolution learners making it the most frequent extern partner with leading dispute resolution program
ic ann is unique bottom up consensus driven multi stakeholder organization
its stake hold ers range in influence from the white house to individual internet users from across the globe
across that panoply of influence there were parties who were more supportive of the executive ombudsman role and others less so
some viewed the office as giving added value to the or ga ni zati on while others took it as an affront to their perception of individual freedoms
frankly some of the community members who accessed the office of the ombudsman were simply querulous complainants while others were extremely genuine in their desire to engage ic ann using out of court dispute resolution techniques
chris la hatte was right in the introduction was invested in the success of the office and wanted him to be well equipped for the job he was going to be facing
so the questions before me included how much time will ic ann invest in training and in mentor ing process what does chris la hatte need to know and when can we possible align our schedules and geo graph ic locations to get it done
secondly which one of us had the ability to work with the org ani za ti on to deal with the first and third questions
journal of the international ombudsman association frank fowl ie and chris la hatte chris had the advantage of experience in electronic case management through my work in liti ga ti on which in new zealand enjoys some support from the legal community
my writing on legal procedure is also useful in considering targets and time management issues
also found that my litigation experience in areas such as judicial review cases had direct correlation to om buds man practice as the concepts of fairness and delay are common features
but dr fowl ie correctly identified me as novice to ombudsmanship practice and needed to use my partial knowledge and dr training to identify my gaps in knowledge
so the big issue for me was to find out what did not know
we then had to create system of hand over to include the introduction to ombudsman pr ac tice where to seek further advice mentor ing and training as well as understanding the complex organisation which is ic ann
it quickly became obvious that needed to discard my system of thinking like lawyer to approach problems
the mediator skills are much more relevant and application of law is seldom useful in complaints to this office
fairness itself really transcends the law which often imposes unfair results and so had to change my way of problem solving as lawyer
so starting on the process of understanding ic ann was the first step and the programme designed by dr fowl ie was critical
needed to understand the organization and its business so that could hit the ground running
had looked at the ic ann web site prior to being appointed and tried to understand how it all worked but the abstract and the reality are of course very different
dr schedule included introductions to as many ic ann executives as we could fit in so they could meet me and more importantly explain their roles within the structure to me
they were without exception patient and welcoming and formed valuable contact points for the future
as the ombudsman would need to work with them and establishing personal relationship was something which dr fowl ie identified as critical to the launch of my new role
in any transition those personal relationships mean that the new person can form the essential personal contacts when practicing in the role
the more mechanical tasks of learning how to use the ic ann software and the case manage ment system were important but they just needed an introduction and study
nonetheless to be able to integrate into the office these items take some of the allocated time to ease the transfer
to anyone coming from outside ic ann it is essential
because new ombudsman may typically come from outside especially in sole practitioner office this will be part of any such transition
it may be obvious as with other aspects but does need anticipation and tailoring to meet the skill set of the incumbent
journal of the international ombudsman association frank fowl ie and chris la hatte the anticipation of training needs in wider sense is something to be tailored to the skill set of the incumbent
as had no ombudsman background relied heavily on dr fowl ie to suggest the basics and fit the training into the week schedule and then anticipate what should then look into for more training
had little idea what was needed except for general sense of need ing much information and gaining this quickly
dr fowl ie was unsure of the level of training as it was all new zealand based and no doubt different from the canadian models he was familiar with
we needed the discussion so we could come to common ground on the gaps and needs
frank fowl ie once the details had been worked out about meeting chris la hatte in marina del in gust my job became the design of training program that would arm chris la hatte for his new job
in my mind the training would be made up of key areas ombudsmanship admin is tra ti on for the ombudsman understanding business being the ic ann ombudsman and conducting ombudsman orientations for staff and the community
ombudsmanship as chris la hatte is new ombudsman it was critical to give him solid orientation to the profession
we had wide range to cover from defining basis of fairness to ombudsman
the training was to be delivered uniquely by dr fowl ie
administration for the ombudsman this included topics such as the transfer of business contacts to the filing of expense claims to physical security
the training was to be delivered by both dr fowl ie and other staff
understanding business ic ann is the agency that administers the domain name system for the internet
it was necessary to give chris la hatte strong understanding of what ic ann does who its stake holders are how it is governed and what issues are on its horizon
at the time of the hand over ic ann was preparing to expand the top level domain by po ten ti ally up to new extensions ie
this business activity could have immense impact on the office of the ombudsman
in addition the topic demanded that many staff members provide their expertise in the orientation
being the ic ann ombudsman we had to cover lot of nuts and bolts of doing om buds manship at ic ann
the list included things such as the case management system providing an ombudsman office at ic ann meetings and working from remote home office
conducting orientations critical activity for the ombudsman is to conduct orientations to new staff stake holders and the outside community
each new ic ann employee receives an orientation from the ombudsman on the dispute resolution within the organization and the ombudsman is frequently called upon to give orientations to others within and outside of the agency
we had two weeks to accomplish very ambitious agenda
journal of the international ombudsman association frank fowl ie and chris la hatte chris la hatte it became obvious that although we had two weeks to achieve the knowledge transfer and training that the allocated time was insufficient
however we were able to rely on the contacts made and dr fowl ie has been most useful and patient mentor in the succeeding period as has been herb wa ye my ongoing adjunct
ideally there should have been transition with an overlap but as we had month hiatus with herb minding the shop there were some prob le ms
it is my view that the transition should ideally be closer to the end of the first om buds term with contemporaneous transfer
the logistics of the appointment process ob vi ated this unfortunately
what worked and thought that the training process facilitated by dr fowl ie worked well subject to the time li mi tat ions imposed
ideally several sessions with gap to absorb the knowledge and then apply the training practically may be better
the staff introduction process so very vital to connecting with the organisation went smoothly and would be an essential part of any ombudsman transition
would regard staff contact as fundamental to any organization and while perhaps obvious this aspect should be at the center of any planning and could require some notice especially for busy senior executives or officials
what lessons did we learn that we can pass along to other ombudsman programs
we think it is important to note that there are many many ombudsman programs where the incumbent is sole practitioner
this article is written not just as narrative of our own ex peri enc es but also to provide some guidance to colleagues who may be transition ing their offices to new ombudsman
frank fowl ie from my point of view there are two key elements
first there has to be plan and second there has to be organizational buy in to support smooth hand over
when developing plan for the hand over the incumbent has to take lot of things into cons id erat ion
for example an employee in the same organization who is promoted into the om buds man role will have different training needs than someone from outside of the organization
someone who is already fulfilling an ombudsman role will have different needs than new ombudsman
journal of the international ombudsman association frank fowl ie and chris la hatte from my perspective when developing the plan key function that has to be passed along is the corporate culture of the office which when it is sole practitioner is often influenced by the personality of the incumbent
if you have two generations of ombudsman with different personalities how do you organize the transition so that all of the expected and public features are transitioned
in our case key factor in transferring the culture of the office was in developing capacity to do new staff briefings
he had very short time to become on expert on his new office and he did well at mastering the knowledge
in planning for an orientation other key factors include an orientation to the business and to the culture of the organization
the new ombudsman to be set up for success in their role needs to be able to grasp quickly and effectively what the organization does as its prime ti ons and how it achieves its goals
critically the new ombudsman needs to be able to operate within the organization as single person office and getting full briefings on administration is sues expense claim submission telecommunications policies etc are very necessary to success
finally critical factor in handing over the office to new ombudsman includes ensuring that the history of the office is passed along
the new ombudsman needs to have good under standing of how and why the office was chartered how buy in in the community was estab lish ed and where the friction points are
the new ombudsman needs to be able to quickly as similate that historical view with an understanding of the current business of the organization to be able to foresee where his services may be needed in the future
for chris la hatte this was critical as he was assuming his role just as ic ann administers the largest expansion of top level domains
hundreds of applications are expected millions of dollars will be invested and will be at risk and be in the middle of sorting out some very powerful issues
organizational buy in is also very important in the hand over
in our case the organization paid for me to come back to provide two week orientation and allowed me to schedule in staff from other work areas to complete the briefings
posit that it would have been helpful to chris la hatte for there to have been an additional mentor ing period even if done online
the more the organization is onboard to have the ombudsman operating as independently as pos sib le as quickly as possible the better
the corollary to this would be word of warning to new ombudsmen who do not get an organizational buy in for their training it could mean that the organization is either disinterested in the ombudsman role or may be trying to subterfuge it
chris la hatte as the incumbent get the last word
after year in the office can now reflect on the tr ansi ti on and consider what we achieved
while most om buds offices spend much time on metrics and reports and analysis of the work being undertaken succession planning seems to be left as either too hard or unlikely

conducting orientations to the office of the ombudsman journal of the international ombudsman association adam bar ak article presents new approach to training sessions delivered by om buds men utilizing improvisation
im prov involves using impulses in natural and spontaneous way to provide satisfy ing and often unexpected outcomes
by incorporating im prov learners build skill stay engaged and are able to utilize their intuition in an experiential learning opportunity
the origins and context of im prov and its use in conflict resolution training are described
detailed pr ac ti cal example of training session focus ing on the skill of listening is presented using this new approach
introduction many ombudsman offices offer training to their constituents
training may focus on conflict resolution negotiation communication difficult conversations or host of other topics mem be rs of the organization need
these sessions are an opportunity not only to teach learners information and skills on variety of topics but also way for the om buds to demonstrate their own expertise foster trust with individuals and increase visibility of the om buds office while serving as model of civil behavior
in many cases om buds use traditional methods of instruction including lecture literature and role play
these approaches offer learners the chance to practice skills such as active listening and to develop techniques for dealing with difficult people
they also afford better under standing of how to manage conflict
the author wishes to thank gordon merle lisa nea le courtney norman nathan phill ips dawn pick en john and sarah woodside
their guidance dedication time and patience are appreciated
thank you to editor david miller for his encouragement and support
in addition the author would like to thank the united world college usa uni ver of massachusetts boston department of conflict resolution human security and global governance and my colleagues in the cornell office of the university ombudsman
journal of the international ombudsman association adam bar ak one of the objectives is to build skill it is important to keep key questions in mind when designing the curriculum
first how can trainers train for single skill that is part of network of skills
further how can they add more practice oriented exercises to their training that can be used to build skill
finally as teachers and trainers frequently ask can keep the learners more interested
most effective training sessions allow skill to come alive for the class
when this is the case students are more likely to use the skill in their own work
courses often cover skills such as reframing attentive listening maintaining neutrality using clear language clarifying interests brainstorming facilitating dialogue and empathy
still many om buds share difficulty in gen er ating practice oriented activities that can be used with learners to help them master these cal skills
typically the component of the lesson consists of role plays where learners have chance to act out given scenario
while the learners may have chance to use the targeted skills in role plays it is often difficult to isolate that skill in the simulation
for example in negotiation role play as the buyer of house learners use host of different skills
they may reframe listen tease out interests eva lu ate offers perspective take and defend against hardball tactics
in fact many of these skills are being employed simultaneously
when we listen for example we are also taking visual cues from the speaker
we look for em phasis coming from hand gestures and we notice where the speaker is looking when they make their points
as benjamin franklin nd said not only to say the right thing in the right place but far more difficult still to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting
knowing when to be silent and allow another voice to fill the space is skill unto itself
when we choose to speak we are simultaneously listening for other cues
one of these signals is whether or not the person understands what we have said
during negotiation role play it is easy to lose track of the individual skill of listening
moreover it is still thornier to practice any of these skills independently of the other activities and that occur in the role play
improvisation holds the answer to this dilemma
improvisation or im prov is the ability to create something without prior preparation
at its best im prov involves one or more people using their instincts and impulses in natural and spontaneous way to provide satisfying and often unexpected outcomes
im prov also differs from skit in which the scenario is predefined and the words previously written down
skits may involve two instructors in scene where learners watch the action
for the solo practitioner the options include delivering prepared monologue or suddenly enlist ing volunteer
working with learner who is not warmed up on scripted material is tall task even for the experienced trainer
im prov however is cooperative and allows for deep ti on by everyone often in concert
journal of the international ombudsman association adam bar ak background in performance work experience and qualitative research on the effectiveness of using im prov in training led me to advocate for its use as productive and worthwhile
uti liz ing im prov is an opportunity for the om buds trainer to add new robustness and interest to his or her sessions and to increase the skill level of the learners
certainly more attention needs to be devoted in order to study the effectiveness of im prov when compared with more traditional approaches
the use of im prov as new approach may not fit with every client or work group that contracts with the om buds to receive training sion
there may be any number of limitations including room size number of learners trainer experience and cultural considerations
other preexisting factors such as the level of trust and conflict within the group must also be weighed
still the use of im prov has much to offer
there is plethora of competencies fundamental to the training sessions that ombudsmen conduct
several of these are identical to the com pe on which improvisers focus to improve their craft
these include listening acceptance thinking on feet creativity working successfully with another person commitment to solving problem not being directive or forcing outcomes and focusing on relationships
thus existing im prov exercises are directly transferable to training sessions offered by om buds
viola sp ol in an american originator and innovator of improvisational exercises for actors points out that experiencing involves an intellectual physical and intuitive level and that of these it is so often the intuitive that is ignored
engaging intuition draws on knowledge beyond the sensory
it allows the learner to experience the situation for him or herself at level of involvement that is difficult to match
the experience is personal to each learner
may be unlocked and insight gained
using im prov brings with it the ability to practice one skill at time
for example im prov ex er cis es can be designed to focus on listening while everything else is isolated
in this way the learner is able to build their mastery of specific technique or task
im prov is the ultimate spontaneous exercise
the moment that is generated by the learners has never existed before and can never be repeated
indeed im prov allows the learner to have moment of self sp ol in spontaneous experience that often times leads to breakthroughs in technique or understanding of the skill being presented
learners stay engaged with the lesson at all times
the approach is effective translatable and interesting not only for the learners but also for the trainer
in order to give context to this new approach and in consideration to those om buds not fa mi liar with im prov brief review is presented of the origins of improvisation in the performing arts and of its use in conflict resolution
subsequently for om buds trainers who seek to add this approach to their own training sessions an example is provided that concentrates on listening one skill central to so many of the different training offerings by om buds
journal of the international ombudsman association adam bar ak performing arts improvisation while improvisation has been employed by various actors and troupes and in many times and places nowhere was the synergy between the two more natural and influential than in comme dia
beginning in the th century troupes using makeshift stages traveled the co un try side of italy performing humorous stories centered on stock characters without the use of script smith
their themes and story lines were universal
they included subjects like love jealousy and ambition but the portrayal of those stories was completed without the pre para ti on of traditional theater
actors would play off each other and did not know where the story was going beforehand
the stock characters included representations of the soldier servant doctor lover and others
exploiting the ability to identify with these archetypes is at the root of modern improvisation and clowning
com media has influenced many significant artists in modern times
dar io fo winner of the nobel prize in literature in dar io fo biography nd drew on the traditions of com media in his acting directing and playwriting
antonio fa va colleague of fo started world renowned school dedicated to com media rud lin crick
new artists moved further into the world of improvisation developing their own style and schools
aug us to bo al developed of the to push his contention that governments use theater to help rule over people bo al
his work helped to outline connections between real life and theater by the use of and participatory theater
by improvising scenes sometimes from real life events those who have been oppressed are sometimes able to achieve an objective understanding of the ex peri enc es they have had
this stemmed from theory of detachment or the translated as from distance without involving bo al
it al lowed someone to become detached about personal situation over which they are unable to gain perspective
his work has been influential in the use of theater in education and in drama therapy
for example jonathan fox built on this work and started playback theater which uses dialogue about psychodramatic improvisations to foster new understandings for all involved fox
viola sp ol in created another major step in the development of modern american improvisation
she developed structures or that players used to guide their improvisations sp ol in
initially actors used these str uc tur es in rehearsal to help them better their craft
rules about what each improviser could or could not do were used to set up framework in which scene with story could develop
by focusing on attentive listening and genuine acceptance of the other offers ideas by player regarding the characters plot or even the layout of room sp ol in spawned new style of improvisation that remains with us today
sp ol in contends that theater game workshops are useful in helping students to better con cen tr ate and problem solve sp ol in
theater games help participants to be more creative and journal of the international ombudsman association adam bar ak develop freedom of thinking
intuition about social interaction is developed in low stakes environment
feedback is immediate once the game has ended
specific games are geared toward skills like listening
theater games are defined by the principle that no one knows what the next line or action will be
players need to work together and relinquish control in order to be successful at resolving or exposing the that is almost always the basis for success scene sp ol in
in england keith john stone was doing some of the same work through different methods
his focus on masks status and narratives helped spur actors into working towards new way of preparation and production
john stone cites the work of wr experience in groups in which bion describes groups where attacks the status of everyone else while pretending to be john stone
john stone looks to theater games in order to play out these in way that is over from acting as competitive group into acting as cooperative
john stone goes on to illuminate the gap between behavior and conscious intention
often times in group person thinks she is acting friendly when in fact she is acting as john stone notes from his work in one of groups
between sp ol in and john stone we now have the basis for the modern world of improvisation that has fostered or multi use theaters and schools that exist in almost every major city in the country
these schools are not only popular among actors but also with ex ecu who flock to im prov courses to improve their ability to think on their feet
corporate team leaders bring entire divisions to im prov courses to cultivate team building
introverts seeking assistance with interpersonal interactions attend classes to give them skills to deal social anxieties
conflict resolution and im prov the overriding principles of improvisation seem to be shared with the world of conflict re so lut ion yet very little has been written making this link
creativity acceptance mutuality risk taking trust awareness collaboration and practice are indeed areas where the two fields are in concert ger ar di
ger ar di also presents the idea that im prov games can help improve skill level
she explains that technique and playing games to develop the skills necessary for releasing creativity can enhance the ability of any
journal of the international ombudsman association adam bar ak and im prov more recently the topic of negotiation and im prov is drawing attention
professional assoc ia ti ons are offering courses such as for im prov for lawyers nd
similar to ge work these classes use exercises based on maxims from the im prov world such as saying instead of bal ach and ra to improve negotiation skills
recognizing offer in mediation session is similar to recognizing an offer in the world of improvisation bal ach and ra et al
the mediator or in the case of im prov the player needs to be open to offers by listening intently and having willingness to be creative about what might come next similar to brainstorming
mediator or any other conflict resolution professional must choose when to use certain moves in repertoire moore and understand which particular move to fall back on in time of need
that choice of which move to use at which time is not just one of skill but one of improvisation
example training module listening warmups in traditional om buds training session are used to shake off natural nervousness and increase their familiarity with each other and the instructor
icebreakers are usually unrelated to the focus of the lesson
in im prov these initial activities or are connected to the skill that is at the center of the training session
warmups are designed to get the blood of the group flowing and start to build synergy and trust
sometimes they are funny so everyone has chance to know that it is safe to laugh at each other and at oneself
warmups can be exclusively vocal or exceptionally active
they can even be silent and used to help the group focus
most importantly warmups not only prepare the group for learning but also begin the lesson in this case listening
when using im prov in an experiential training session the introductory activities are even more important because learners will be sharing in activities that are unfamiliar to them
they may be standing up in front of each other involved in make believe scene or moving around the space in way to which they are unaccustomed
the trainer should spend generous amount of time on activities that are simple to learn and allow for immediate participation while still addressing the predetermined skill area
challenge for the trainer in this type of experiential training is building trust in the group
en sur ing the group is comfortable enough with each other to take chances risk making mistakes or even looking silly is paramount
to address this the trainer should establish guidelines at the beginning of the session to establish safe environment one where the learners can ex peri ment without judgment and provide salient feedback to each other
the guidelines for feed back should consist of making sure that care and empathy are used when talking about each work
journal of the international ombudsman association adam bar ak and acknowledge warmup by reducing the communication in the group to single clear offer and acceptance each learner continuously finds permission to move spots while standing in circle
player begins by glancing at another player in the circle player once their gaze is returned player asks have your spot
player begins slow walk toward their new spot
meanwhile player im me di ately looks to one of the other players in the circle player once their gaze is met player similarly asks have your spot
player may not move until they have asked and received permission to move to new spot
therefore when player has given up their spot and the new resident is approaching they will be forced to seek that same acknowledgement from another player
if the group makes mistake and two players occupy the same spot gently restart the warmup and play until the group is proficient
round in this version the warmup is played silently
instead of asking for spot players merely glance making firm eye contact to request spot and nod to accept request
the warmup is continuous series of offers acknowledgments and agreements
each player asks for new spot
in order to be successful in round the group must listen to the silent chatter of offers continually being conveyed
once player arrives at new spot they immediately turn around to see where the silent conversation is being ex pressed
players learn to listen with their eyes and with their intuition for where in the circle the soundless conversation is taking place
by expanding awareness to who is in the group what they need and when they need it more complete form of listening is realized
exercises trainers use skill building exercises in order for learners to practice model mimic or explore skill
im prov exercises are an instructor led group activity designed to work on specific skill or set of skills
from my experience with groups not familiar with this type of training exercises that focus on single skill at time work best
the benefits are more transparent to the student and the learners are able to engage fully with every aspect of that skill
the lessons they learn do not diffuse in an assortment of directions
journal of the international ombudsman association adam bar ak conversations at once exercise this exercise pairs learners in the activity of telling story and listening to story
it was modi fied from classic exercise dedicated to refining awareness called contrapuntal argument sp ol in
pairs should be well spaced from other pairs
the trainer announces that one player in each pair will tell story about certain topic
pairs should designate who will be the storyteller and who will be the listener
the trainer explains that in moment the topic for storytelling will be revealed and once the pairs hear
the storyteller is instructed to go on without pause and in rich detail until they hear
trainer announces single topic eg what the player ate for breakfast the last time they bought car memorable birthday and says
the trainer then instructs the listener in each pair to recite the story back to the story teller including every detail they can remember
once the instructor gives the pairs couple of minutes accomplish this the instructor restarts the exercise with the pairs switching their roles
each time the exercise is restarted the instructor gives brand new topic for the story
round in this round the pairs repeat the exercise with both players telling story sim ulta neo us ly
each player in the pair is the storyteller and the listener at the same time
the trainer announces new topic and says
each player simultaneously tells detailed story to his or her partner
after one minute the trainer announces
instructor gathers everyone together in one group for discussion
with the instructor facilitating learners take turns reciting as much as they remember from their story at tempting to provide abundant detail where possible
the player who is the actual owner of the story helps their partner along and can make mention of details that were forgotten distorted or incorrect
at this point players often ask for round to be repeated
repeat and come back together as one group to debrief
round other permutations of the exercise can be accomplished in groups of three instead of pairs
one example is player tells story to player player also tells story to player player listens to both stories at once
when the groups are stopped player reveals first what they remember from player story then player
round can be tried by only single group of three with other learners watching by all the students or not at all
when the exercise is over the instructor asks player to reveal what he or she noticed in each round
players should confront if they had difficulty listening when they were in the role of listener round as well as when they took on the role of storyteller and listener simul tane journal of the international ombudsman association adam bar ak round
when conduct this exercise with my im prov troupe we repeat round several times
players often find they have success with practice and that they can remember more of what was said as they tune themselves acutely to both roles
game sa game can consist of two players in in essence having conversation in particular place
in fact an im prov scene consists of some of the same terms familiar to conflict resolution practitioners
there is the the and the
these are the actual terms used in the im prov world
in typical three hour practice session an im prov troupe might try twenty or thirty scenes
each one of these is mini mediation session
the players enter the scene with an and begin to the scene
the idea for the objective usually is based on suggestion given by an audience member or someone who is not on stage
objective can be thought of as what mediators term
suggestions can be anything at all
often times word toothbrush relationship sisters or an emotion ecstatic works well
incorporating the suggestion provides focus that helps the player to form character understand who they are or what they are doing in scene
gestio ns also provide limitless cache of scenarios from which to work
no two scenes are ever alike but each has and
after the conflict develops between the players
the conflict might be about their competing objectives or based on their personalities or identities
most of the time third player enters to resolve the conflict either through inventing options or helping the characters to clarify and understand what they are really interests
other im prov games or structures refer to improvisational constructs that consist of rules that the players must follow
games can be way for learners to freely use the skill they have been practicing in an interesting or fun way
narrative story game with the help of conductor learners share the telling of single story
four players are lined up shoulder to shoulder and informed by the trainer that they will be telling story together
at different moments they each will become the storyteller as dictated by the conductor
the trainer explains that he or she will act as the conductor of the story
if the conductor points at player he or she is turned and is instantly the storyteller
the storyteller recites the text of the story with gusto just as if he or she were reading it from book to an interested audience
the storyteller is instantly turned when the conductor points to new player
the new storyteller must continue from where the last storyteller left off
the conductor asks those not playing for topic or title of the story suggestion repeats it to the four players and begins
journal of the international ombudsman association adam bar ak timing the conductor uses to switch between storytellers is important
the conductor starts by pointing at player and should not switch to new storyteller until few paragraphs of the story are recited or the player gets stuck
once each of the four storytellers has had chance to tell small piece of the story the conductor starts to switch storytellers more rapidly
now the conductor switches after only few sentences per player
finally the conductor varies the choice of storyteller midsentence
even with the increasing level of difficulty players should attempt not to repeat words when the storyteller is switched
players should attempt to keep the flow and orientation of the story
the game is then repeated with four new players until the entire group has had chance to participate
after everyone has participated the instructor asks the learners which stories they were able to follow and why
the trainer may also ask an audience member listening to the story what were the memorable characters or places
once the players have chance to share what was successful discuss the experience of being the storyteller
one of the other three storytellers in the group was was it difficult to merely listen and not preplan what to say next time you are chosen
indicate that the only task that matters is listening because the story is constantly changing
planning what to say next actually disrupts the play
of course this can be valuable lesson when listening in real life
in training sessions conduct with learners that have no background in improvisation the idea of both leading the story and following the story at the same time can be difficult at first
repeat the game with different groups to allow learners the chance to explore listening without con se qu en ce
conclusion among their many functions ombudsman offices offer training sessions on variety of conflict resolution and communication themes
while established teaching methods are suitable new approach using im prov concepts and activities derived from theater is offered to allow trainers the ability to focus on individual skills and experiential learning
using im prov learners are able to work with an endless variety of scenarios an experience that conventional approaches do not offer
im prov warmups exercises and games enhance the experience for the learner who can now bring intuition and spontaneity to the training
with no spectators im prov makes training more effective enjoyable and engaging

of the international ombudsman association sh weta is an inevitable phenomenon in organizational affairs often necessary for participatory governance
it can not be eliminated however its negative impact can and should be contained
managing the impact of conflict requires robust and holistic measurement mechanism that can identify and assess the impact and monitor and evaluate its management
to this end study span ning several months was carried out at public sector international org ani za ti on
this article draws from its findings offering an insight into approaches to framing the essence of organizational conflict and using the art and science of risk management to capture its impact holistically
what is measurable and make measurable what is not galileo galilei conflict resolution practitioners often get to see both sides of stories that knock on their doors organizational om buds persons especially poised to see more than two sides bigger pictures including systemic trends and patterns in workplace conflict root causes and plaguing con di ti ons perpetuating it and the detrimental impact of conflict on various constituencies including its workforce the organization and its clients
the author is deeply grateful to helm ut buss for his unbending support and en courage ment over the past year without which it would not have been possible to carry out the study
the author thanks ma me diag ne james lee es kand er ras teg ar jud it and ko jo for their input and help several others in various units and departments of the international organization that was the subject of this study and sim seg al for his special input on risk management
previous study about controlling conflict costs published in the journal of the international ombudsman association in indicated the need to develop robust measurement me cha nis ms and pointed out that without measurement conflict management in organizations risks being limited to issue resolution and transactional changes to systemic problems
it does not extend to systematic basis upon which an conflict resolution strategy can be evaluated nor its performance on conflict management be appraised for its overall impact on the organization
in addition to the what the study point outs measurement offers sound basis to gauge the ef fica cy and adequacy of existing conflict management establishments within organizations such as an office basis to enhance the role of the ombudsperson in participatory corporate governance and basis to evaluate any need to mainstream conflict management by embedding it into operational processes
with this theme as the impetus qualitative research study spanning approximately seven months was conducted at an international organization in the public sector
the research meth odology was case study of conflict within one agency of the international organization and involved document desk reviews semi structured interviews and informal discussions and on site observations
publicly accessible sources internal sources and proxy data where data for the agency or broader organization was unavailable or nonexistent was used for the purpose
in order to better inform practice and build rooted business case rigorous inter disciplinary theory was relied upon
overall substantive support was extended by the office which has in the past driven efforts to raise awareness of the costs of conflict and contin to do so
the idea behind this work was to step up those efforts and translate them into an actionable approach to conflict cost measurement
the aim of the study was as follows
identify holistic scalable and integrative approach that would measure the impact of inter conflict on the strategic objectives in other words the real cost of conflict
assess the effectiveness of the conflict management system in man aging the impact of conflict and where relevant to recommend strategies for the to expand and evolve
challenged by the subtle dangers of reification deliberate choice was made to refrain from strictly defining the term or delimiting its boundaries
during the course of the study it was found that so much of what the term denotes lies in the eyes of the beholder and this is stated based on several unstructured interviews conducted with people outside the office to some it is simply disagreement among people and no more to others the real conflict is not so much the manifest effects but underlying structural causes and systemic failures which are sources of problems and to others still it is unregulated dynamics within the self causing unreasonable expectations and conduct
to practitioners in the field of conflict resolution it is perhaps all of the above and more
of significance here is not so much what the term means to people in an organizational context but how such understanding colors general perception of the role of the om buds per son in internal control and of the services an office can provide in promoting principles of good governance
this is especially true in organizations where channels are nascent and evolving and demand for their services must sometimes be created in the midst of other actors in governance such as ethics audit and investigations units
mea sur ing the impact of conflict as tool for good governance would be somewhat like applying blue ocean strategy bos creating an uncontested market space by offering leap in value
in order to develop clear understanding of the phenomenon without defining it the first stage in the study involved constructing theoretical framework as the basis to discover the characteristic features of the multidimensional phenomenon
de constructing the phenom en on into broad elements including issues and trends involved causes conditions and context impact of conflict on various constituencies and the role of the existing conflict management system fundamental aspects were probed in detail
aspects such as the extent of reliance on volume of cases as measure of severity and potential threat cognizance of factors inhibiting conflict from surfacing hidden markets clustered around cultures of sorts sphere of outreach and influence of the recognition of multiple root causes and chronic conditions at tri bu ti on of causes to both agency and structure the sociopolitical context within which the org ani zati on operates and the wide ranging impact of conflict were analyzed
using proprietary and proxy data the conflict system comprising the four elements issues and trends causes con di ti ons and context impact and costs of conflict the was viewed in its entirety
deep dive using the optic of social science theories helped cull out characteristic features of the conflict system such as interconnectedness and interdependence reciprocal and bidi rec ti on al causality nonlinearity complexity and unpredictability
conflict within the organization examined was found to be dynamical system encompassing the interplay of the elements issues causes impact and mentioned earlier which interacted in complex and non lin ear ways
according to dynamical systems theory in social psychology because of the journal of the international ombudsman association sh weta of interactions among various elements in system the system as whole evolves in seemingly unpredictable ways and the activation of each element is determined by the total influence from other elements in the system
dynamical systems are held together and kept in place by strong attractors
an example of an attractor in an interpersonal conflict is strongly held view of the other party such that even contradictory information is interpreted so that it is in line with the strongly held view thus keeping the conflict in place
in the context of the organization examined in this study strong attractor for the conflict tem was the culture of accountability in all its facets from strategic high level accountability of the organization as whole to meet its objectives and serve its clients to the accountability of the senior management to its executive board for the efficient stewardship of its resources to the accountability of each member of its workforce to display ethical conduct et al
concern for greater accountability is consistently echoed in the reports of the office for the relevant international organization examined
so how does one approach conflict resolution in such complex and multidimensional conflict environment
on the aspect of conflict resolution points out that any attempts to change the state of conflict without changing the attractors that continually reinstate the conflict may yield short term results but are unlikely to succeed in the long run
the theory further states that lasting change can be promoted when the attractors in the system are changed
in the context of the organization studied robust and holistic measurement and management model would be an attempt to foster such lasting change by promoting accountability which is strong attractor in its conflict system
approach to measurement the quest is not to measure the phenomenon in its entirety it is to measure the inter me di ate and final impact of conflict
one might then question the need to study the entire system and its characteristics instead of focusing gaze solely on the impact
this is because the impact of conflict on employees the organization and its clients is ever changing according to dynamical systems theory
new issues trends causes and conditions can cause the impact and costs of conflict to be felt in ways not experienced before
emerging studies can shed light on perspectives which may have escaped conscious attention in the past
for instance report published by earth institute columbia university in based on decades of research on happiness shows happiness and satisfaction to be directly correlated with workplace aspects including measures of job security autonomy workplace trust independence and intrinsic mo ti vat ion at work rather than only pay at work
journal of the international ombudsman association sh weta the impact of conflict is in state of perpetual evolution is not only common sense but is grounded in rigorous theory
applying dynamical systems theory to an organizational conflict context studying the impact of conflict in isolation is likely to offer at best myopic vision
any measurement models built on impact assessments alone and using sub elements of impact as inputs to arrive at summary statistics risk being less comprehensive and rigorous and having restricted world view
such inputs might include sub elements such as absenteeism pres en tee ism productivity and efficiency losses stress induced healthcare costs litigation expenses reputation al damage high turnover and others
the impact is key subject of inquiry were it not for the detrimental impact of conflict dis put ed issues and root causes of conflict would be relegated to mere transactional occurrences and unavoidable costs of doing business incurred in the pursuit of the mission not intrinsically motivating enough to warrant change
measuring the impact of conflict pro vi des business case for conflict management to be part of the corporate governance agenda and showcases how the two are inter twined
measuring the impact holistically rather than in isolation invariably helps draw attention to the causes and conditions which lie at the source of all disputes
in other words it is necessary to study the characteristics of conflict system as whole if lasting change is to be promoted
studying the nature of the conflict and framing its characteristic features is essential to identify ing the attributes one must look for while selecting measurement approach this could dif fer for organizations
on more general note some theorists suggest that factors while select ing measure should include content validity reliability and precision ie whether the measure captures the concept whether it yields consistent results how finely can it be expressed for example measures could use high medium low rankings ranking on numerical scale or more precise quantification
in the context of the organization studied all the factors mentioned above were considered
in addition to these considerations practical aspects such as sc al ability and ease of integration with business processes were also kept in mind
using these parameters three measurement approaches were evaluated including constructing composite index from the ground up adopting and integrating external tools such as conflict cost calculator and maximizing the use of the framework
was found to be the ap proach most fit for the purpose and concepts discussed in this article
in order to measure the uncertain and unpredictable impact of conflict it is important to determine what it represents
viewed from the perspective of the examined risk management strategy one of its key tools to strengthen accountability within the org ani za ti on uncertainty associated with the impact of conflict presents both threats and op port uni ties
initiatives such as the committee of sponsoring organizations co so of the tread way commission dedicated to providing thought leadership on risk management suggest that all entities face uncertainty and that such uncertainty presents both threats and opportunities with the potential to erode or enhance value
events with negative impact represent threats which can prevent value creation or erode existing value
viewed this way the impact of conflict represents what is widely defined as risk
some experts in risk management define risk as any journal of the international ombudsman association sh weta what is expected including both downside volatility range of possible downside events and upside volatility range of possible upside events
this definition considers risk as the possibility that results may be either higher or lower than expected
speaking of expect results this will vary depending upon the vision purpose and goals of differ organizations
in the context of the international organization examined in this study ex pe ct ed results are not only what it is expected to deliver to its clients but also how it conducts itself in the pursuit of its goals
for this organization whether the impact of conflict represents downside risks or opportunities will depend largely upon the effectiveness of its internal con tr ol system and the conflict management system
managed effectively it could provide opp or tu ni ties for transformation in organizational culture
if not it would contribute to ongoing high costs and negative impact for all stake holders involved including its clients
after evaluating other potential approaches enterprise risk management was selected as rational fit
enterprise risk management holistic approach to risk management is process in management strategy and is designed to identify events that may affect the achievement of the objectives
experts in risk management state that is not strictly serial or linear process where one component affects only the next
it is dynamic and multidirectional process in which almost any component can and does influence another
is reasonable choice when evaluated against the measurement criteria discussed earlier in this article
it is valid reasonable and precise approach
is embedded into the business practices of the international organization examined in this study and is scalable model
life cycle approach depicted in figure below allows for risk events to be identified from risk universe or register qualitatively assessed and measured by assigning weights along impact and probability scales development of appropriate response strategies monitoring and eva lu ati on of results
it is also key tool at the disposal of the examined organization to promote figure journal of the international ombudsman association sh weta
the risk catalogue with broad risk types such as strategic opera ti on al governance financial and other risk categories and sub categories serves as guide to risk identification
the international organization for supreme audit institutions into sai points out in one of its reports that the methodology for analyzing risks can vary because many risks are difficult to quantify while others lend themselves to numerical diagnosis stating further that risk ti on is more of an art than science
effectiveness of the conflict management system in managing the impact of conflict one of the aims of the study as mentioned earlier was to throw light on the effectiveness of the conflict management system in internal control and in managing the impact of conflict
into sai guidelines on internal control standards state that internal control constitutes series of actions that permeate an activities and are pervasive in the way an organization is run
it further notes that everyone in an organization has responsibility for internal control and that external parties play an important role in the internal control process by providing information useful to effect internal control
as inside outsiders om buds persons and other actors within an play an important role in governance
evaluating the effectiveness of the in internal control was done using into sai guidelines which provide basis against which internal control can be evaluated
the guidelines include components such as tone at the top risk assessment com mu ni cation control activities and monitoring
the direct and indirect role played by the along each of these parameters was evaluated and it was found that there were considerable opp or tu ni ties for individual and collective action on the part of actors within the to strengthen internal control
assessing the risks related to the impact of conflict measuring them robustly and vociferously communicating them could help influence the tone at the top and could have greater impact on the internal control activities
making structured risk assessments part of service delivery and standard operating procedure of the and collective action on the part of the would create force field giving the conflict management discussion seat at the enterprise risk management table
this could be done in several different ways one of which is to form working group with representatives from different parts of the organization
working group would be ideal to develop shared understanding of organizational conflict and the reasonably foreseeable risks its impact poses which are perhaps going unheeded to develop robust action plans to identify assess and strategically communicate these risks to the administration
the idea here is to expand the from distinct offices and units to the enterprise as whole ie embedded in business processes
it is similar to having checks and balances for compliance set up compliance offices but compliance remains business
the impetus to have journal of the international ombudsman association sh weta checks and balances is due of the impact of noncompliance in the form of regulatory penalties et al
similarly unless the impact of conflict pinches the corporate agenda there will be little incentive to transform
collective action on the part of the using could po ten ti ally move the needle in that direction
an additional recommendation is to go beyond the qualitative process described earlier and make risk reporting even more precise by quantifying the impact of risks
this means in addition to qualitatively measuring the risk efforts could be made to quantify risks
an external expert consulted during this study recommended identifying risks by source and work ing with worst case scenarios for the purpose of assigning qualitative scores on the probability scale and having few clearly defined key metrics in order to capture the impact on the or ga end objectives
using several numerical methods individual risk scenarios and the im pact of integrated risk scenarios risk interactivity can be quantified to arrive at enterprise risk exposure values and single statistic incorporating all the downside risk
the expert consulted stated that even risks which appear very subjective in nature such as poor management can be quantified using deterministic approach to risk scenario development which involves hu man judgment rather than automated processes
this is especially important in the context of conflict situations which are often fraught with subjectivity and lack of objective and quanti fi able data
an example of deterministic risk scenario is conflict situation in which due to poor management in certain business segment the unit experiences high turnover loss of critical employees absenteeism all of which impact the productivity of the unit and adversely impacts the reputation of the organization and business unit
reputation al damage in turn causes loss of funding and the unit fails to meet its strategic objectives
this approach also helps identify the source and facilitates decision making which addresses the root cause
in addition to making risk reporting more precise quantification offers another way to measure the value of service provided by an office mitigation related service the value of which can be measured as its impact on the end objectives
as the risk recommended method suggests the value being positive if its contribution to obj ec due to lowered risk exposure is greater than its detraction from objectives
given the hierarchical nature of the organization studied it is the tone at the top which has overall influence on structuring control activities and implementing change initiatives
the ex tent to which the is able to influence decision making at the top will determine the extent to which it can expand to become embedded in day to day business processes
concurrently this will also mean that the evolves to more preventive system in which the negative im pact of conflict can be contained early on or even nipped in the bud
impact assessments help establish the business rationale for this and offers scientific platform to measure the real costs of conflict
it needs to be harnessed effectively by the in order for conflict manage ment to become part of the corporate governance agenda
the scope of the in this study was limited to the office the ethics office and the audit office
kim and mau borg ne professors of management strategy at in se ad coined the term
in their book ocean they describe blue oceans as unknown and untapped market space which can be created by reaching beyond existing demand by focusing on non customers and offering leap in value
applied mainly in industrial growth and economic policy the use of the term in this paper is limited in scope and meant to highlight the untapped market space for an om bud services
now ak and vall acher in their book systems in social state that has proven useful in understanding diverse phenomena
they state that elements in dynamical system interact in complex reciprocal and nonlinear ways
elements are interactive in nature and it is the pattern of causal relations that shapes the phenomenon rather than any causal mechanism in is ola ti on
the basic feature of is connectionism ie the activation of each element is determined by the total influence of all other elements across connections its architecture resembling that of the nervous system
in nonlinear systems the effects of changes in one variable are not reflected in proportional manner in others
according to dynamical systems are kept in place by strong at tractors which are coherent states that emerge over time from the interaction among elements and that lasting change can take place when attractors in the system are dislodged or changed

david miller as profession we stand on the shoulders of giants
for those in the st century attending graduate programmes on alternative dispute resolution or researching optimal means for securing and reinforcing ombudsman visibility or joining established ombudsman offices in multiplicity of sectors there is debt to be acknowledged of service of recognition of deep appreciation for the unbelievable character achievements and examples our forebears in have shown
handful of completely extraordinary people have actually created us
it is high time we acknowledged and celebrated their achievements and legacy
the editorial team has long proposed to celebrate our pioneers across sectors by describing who they are and have been sector by sector
we have also considered describing pioneers by the contributions they have made to organisational ombudsman principles and policy administration and implementation
because we have been so concerned to avoid inadvertent omissions in describing the contributions of pioneers we have determined that our efforts should be continual
in making start in this volume we recognise that our narratives are not definitive
tom has opened our celebration of pioneers by focussing on higher education
in his beautifully constructed review of how evolved in that sector tom has chronicled the development of individual professional lives evolving into coherent series of networks and ultimately deeply respected profession
we are so grateful for his work and to those he highlights
is it not wonderful to see these remembered professional lives in print alongside photos of the real people who made our profession happen
hallmark of healthily evolving profession is its capacity to nurture critical thinking and expression in its newest members
this volume is graced by the winner and runner up in the latest writing competition
david miller to best fit that evolution
kathy paper proposes data collection methodology that may help illuminate the added value an ombudsman brings to organ is at ions
her paper is very timely discussion of the importance of identifying categories of risk contained in the issues brought to ombudsman offices such contemplation is overdue and further discussion on this is welcomed
warmest congratulations to zach and to kathy
conflict is ubiquitous in organ is at ions of course and bringing closure to conflicts may not be the end of those stories
katherine hale and james een provide expressions of proven processes to help restore trust collaboration and pro activity following post conflict organisational reconstruction taken from organ is at ions and from national post conflict lessons
in our final paper martin freres summa rises some key findings on the quantification of the costs of organisational conflict
there are not many surprises in where costs lie but the costs of unresolved conflict are immense
this is an issue we first raised in vol
and which we intend to continue in coming volumes
the associate editors and have been planning our own transition from our roles
we asked the membership for expressions of interest in doing what we do and have been extremely gratified by the response
having used clear criteria to assist in the selection process am delighted to announce that from the associate editors will be howard gad lin cynthia joyce samantha en nis and sandra morris on
we are greatly looking forward to working with our successors over the course of volume by which time my successor will have also been determined
thanks to all who kindly volunteered
finally it is time to give thanks to our hardworking and diligent reviewers
this volume saw the largest proportion of unsolicited manuscripts ever in total and these along with the articles we asked acknowledged experts to write meant slightly higher than average review load
in our next issue we will thank all reviewers who have been helping us to this point but the reality of our journal is that our standards of publication are direct reflection of our authors and our reviewers
grateful thanks to you all from all of us in the editorial team

eleven pioneers of higher education om buds ing were interviewed for this article including three different types of pioneers those who served in the ombudsman role before there were professional organizations standards of practice formalized training journals newsletters or conferences those who largely through their publications and presentations significantly influenced the thinking and practices of their colleagues and those who played key roles in starting andor leading the professional organizations that support the work of higher education ombudsmen
not surprisingly several ombudsmen included here meet more than one of these criteria
the interviews did not follow consistent format varying according to the individual experiences of those interviewed and the intuition about what to ask
for each however their pioneering accomplishments are identified
and many interviewees did address somewhat similar topics such as origins of the office early recollections challenges rewards andor accomplishments

om hart sock university of california at angeles pioneering contributions when former campus minister don hart sock became first university ombudsman in he was among the first wave of university ombudsmen in the us
after meeting periodically for several years to compare notes with geoffrey wall ace of the university of california at santa barbara and bill from california state university angeles the three collaborated to start what eventually became an annual meeting of the california caucus of college and university om buds every november at the beautiful as il omar conference grounds in pacific grove ca
good timing after hart sock served as presbyterian campus minister at uc la for six years and one year as the associate dean for student activities he and his family including his wife jo and five children joined the peace corps
they were stationed in micronesia where he served as deputy director for two years
hart sock explained that his decision to leave after two years was matter of principle
the us military wanted to store nuclear weapons on ships and on land in micronesia
but the volunteer peace corps lawyers who being faithful to their call as had been assisting local micronesian legislators
and the legislators were opposed to having nuclear weapons in their country
when the decision was made in washington dc to eliminate the volunteer program without any input from hart sock or from the director hart sock told the director he stomach this and resigned
the same afternoon hart sock received telephone call from vice chancellor for student affairs rosemary park who invited him to consider taking the newly created position of university ombudsman
reflecting on this key life decision he told the author said not
know how to spell it and know what was involved or anything else
had some communication with some of the students when they were talking about it but never thought would be candidate for it
took it and started that fall
what been doing in the peace corps was
listening and talking with people who thought differently and held different cultural values
so it was natural for getting into the campus again in different
om se bo kin the ombudsman role one thing was very important to hart sock in accepting his new position independence
he said was not on the staff
had dotted box and dotted line and told the chancellor can erase it or you can erase it but the ombudsman role has to be
community building hart sock remembers working with group on campus to create what was then called the policies which recognized how the administrative staff on campus was being ignored
this led to helping them organize staff assembly which gave staff voice in the university
this idea was eventually replicated on other campuses of the university of california uc system
hart sock also worked with faculty in the development of faculty code of conduct
he quoted the preamble to the code of conduct university seeks to provide and sustain an environment that is conducive to sharing extending and critically examining knowledge and values and to nurture the search for
of significant importance to him was the fact that the statement began with the phrase university seeks
to him this meant that included everyone students staff faculty and administration in the uc la community
according to hart sock this notion was in stark contrast to the more commonly held view or metaphor of the university as medieval institution in which hart sock explained regents were the house of lords the chancellor was the duke the administrators were the royal family the faculty were the nobles the students were the squires and the alumni were the emerging mercantile class who have to foot the bill
also helped students and others receive training in community development and community relations
one undergraduate student at the time who he helped receive such training was the late ray who eventually founded the community boards of san francisco
he also founded partners for democratic change which as reported in his obituary in the january edition of the angeles times is to the advancement of civil society and the culture of nonviolent dispute resolution with centers established in countries around the
after the tragic killings of students at kent state university and jackson state university in the spring of hart sock shuttled between administrators and the to put together town hall meeting to allow members of the campus community to come together publically and talk about their concerns
he remembers that political activist and controversial professor angela davis was one of the speakers
even years after his retirement hart sock was so well regarded in the uc la community that he was asked to speak to memorial gathering soon after the attacks according to september story in today faculty and staff
as minister and peace builder on that auspicious occasion he spoke about the need to begin healing
om se boko rig ins of hart sock acknowledges that he was to formal
when asked about how came about he said that while it had been relatively easy for he bill and geoffrey wall ace to meet periodically since they were relatively close geographically knew there were lot of other people who were interested in the same thing and we were bold enough and stupid enough and perhaps enough
we said invite some people we know who are doing this kind of
they invited other ombudsmen university administrators and others they thought were interested in the kind of work they were doing

describing the idea for the caucus hart sock said thought the whole idea was the same thing we were talking about on the campus
in the caucus nobody is the priest
the point was community that gathers wanders on the sand on the beach in pacific grove
just eating together and talking together and walking together
that was the thrust of it
you can learn hell of lot from people if you just listen to what they have to
hart sock summarized caucus is for listening and sharing not just
geoffrey wall ace university of california at santa barbara pioneering contributions geoffrey wall ace was among the first individuals hired to serve as ombudsman on campus of the university of california
while still student in sociology at the university of california at santa barbara uc sb he took graduate seminars and much inspiration from one of the leading scholars on the ombudsman concept political science professor stanley anderson
this makes him one of the only if not the only university ombudsman to be introduced to the concept by one of the leading scholars in the world
wall ace is among small number of individuals to serve in the same university ombudsman role for over years to
one of his most enduring pioneering achievements was collaborating with don hart sock and bill to start the annual meeting of the at the as il omar conference grounds in pacific grove ca
om se bo kab out during his first three years in the role at uc sb geoffrey wall ace met periodically with don hart sock of the university of california angeles and bill from california state university angeles
wall ace recalled was the only one of the three who had never been working
the three collaborated to start what eventually became an annual meeting of the california caucus of college and university om buds every november at the beautiful as il omar conference grounds in pacific grove ca
writing about the annual gathering in wall ace said as il omar participants are paired in rooms equipped in early summer camp
the dining on the grounds is all in one building so everyone meets at breakfast
the lack of bedside telephones and televisions turns attention toward each other
he continued beach as pictured in and taylor and offers setting for conflict workers in education to destress enough to stand back from their practice and ask few questions about how they are doing and how the practice is going

om by cambridge ma area feminists in their discussions which may have resulted in mit being the first large us organization to develop policies and procedures using this was instrumental in developing what the international ombudsman association now calls the among developing and annually presenting the of issues she and om buds colleagues have identified as new serving as the first instructor for course for new and aspiring ombudsmen and for those considering establishing an office known initially as and now called of organizational ombudsman by serving as one of the original associate editors on the journal of the international ombudsman association editorial board
origins of the ombudsman role at mit mary ro we was an economist working in consulting firm in
she had recently returned from west africa with three small children and was interested in seeing the world change for
she was asked by woman friend and faculty member at mit to apply for new position there
this faculty member was among group of women who had asked the new president and chancellor of mit year earlier to hire woman into senior administrative position
new president jerry we isn er and new chancellor paul gray had agreed to this request but because no one had been hired and the women had heard nothing about any action being taken they were skeptical about whether the promise was sincere
although ro we was initially reluctant to pretend to have interest in this mysterious position because of her special friendship with this woman she eventually agreed to inquire about it
also as it happened ro we had also accepted short term assignment to write carnegie foundation grant proposal for five institutions which if accepted promised to bring hundreds of thousands of dollars for release time support for faculty women at the institutions involved
so she already had some to discuss with people at mit
and after inquiring about the position she later confessed to an administrative assistant about the reason for her inquiry
when she finally met new president jerry we isn er former science advisor to president kennedy and the new chancellor paul gray she became sincerely interested in the position
we isn er and gray formed new senior leadership at mit
from her initial conversations with them it appeared to ro we that they had strong interest in what would now be called
although she had enjoyed her discussions with we isn er and gray weeks passed and ro we hearing nothing had almost given up on the position
om se bo kc ions may have been justified
when she finally spoke to gray he told her he and we isn er had been discussing the position
and he said think what we would like to say is this is an institution of science and technology and like someone to come and make humans more visible
that struck ro we as extremely appealing
she also learned that prior to their discussions with her very distinguished woman had indeed been selected for the position
but tragically on the day she had accepted the position she was killed in traffic accident
although news of this tragedy was disturbing ro we was relieved to learn that we isn er and gray were indeed sincere about the promise they had made
she began her work at mit in early
before she started work title at mit was to be assistant to the president and to the chancellor for
she knew she wanted to see both men and women in this new role so at her request it was changed to assistant to the president and the chancellor for women and
also in her first year at mit ro we asked if it might be possible to have an african american and ideally male counterpart
we isn er and gray agreed and clarence williams then associate dean of the graduate school was hired for the position
defining the role looking back ro we believes the work in which she and williams were engaged in or would now be recognized as that of an organizational ombudsman
but when her position was created there were very few women especially within the administration at mit
and the position had been requested by group of women with many concerns about the treatment of women
so it was given an initial title that reflected those concerns
at one point she shared with we isn er and gray the perspective of woman whose situation ro we found particularly egregious and gray later told her that we isn er wants to know both sides of the story
ro we replied you want me to be
not long after ro we asked that her title and that of her colleague clarence williams be shortened to simply assistant to the president and the eliminating the phrases women and and minority in order to better convey impartiality and adding the title ombudsperson
in addition at some time in the first few years ro we had been asked by an administrator not we isn er or gray to conduct formal investigation
she did it but afterward decided that investigations were too close to managerial and also made it difficult to be seen as impartial
ro we believes she was very fortunate in having these particular bosses
she described we isn er as and gray as
and she said they made wonderful leadership team because we isn er had great vision and had great sensitivity to what are now called likely because of his own personal experiences with antisemitism
and gray she said was particularly adept at implementation
om se bo kt hr ough the doors they opened for
and remarkably through collaborating with we isn er and gray over the first year she began to conduct herself in ways that fit extraordinarily well with standards of practice
by the end of her first year ro we said neutrality independence and informality were all explicitly part of the emergent job
om ro we said that although she did have one terrific colleague williams she was professionally and she kept looking for others with similar jobs working elsewhere
sometime between and she learned about group of ombudsmen from the midwestern us who were meeting informally
she had heard the term but did not know was anybody else with job like until she attended their meeting
she remarked was no longer alone in the universe
she described the first meeting as
she said was held in hotel with swimming
according to ro we the or so in attendance the two days in the swimming pool
she approached we isn er and gray about her title and as noted above her new title and clarence became
in addition to these initial ro we eventually found others largely from the corporate arena and she helped them start the corporate ombudsman association
she said she had been dealing not only with academic related issues but also issues like waste fraud and abuse
so she found both groups of colleagues helpful
ro we recalled mentioning in planning meeting for the corporate ombudsman the fear she had observed in response to
gay related infectious only recently identified as and suggested they put it on the agenda for the upcoming meeting
ro we recalled that carole tr oc ch io from southland corporation
to me and said problems originate at mit
you have to do something called the crystal ball
ro we remarked gave it name and humorously defamed my institution by imagining that we were the origin of the
each year untill ro we asked ombudsman colleagues what things they have observed compiled this list including her own observations and presented andor distributed it at annual conferences
naturally this list has always been called the crystal ball
challenges when asked about challenges she encountered ro we replied and she recalled losing her voice for about six months in her fourth year on the job
at first she worried that it was psychological but said she also did lot of public speaking and teaching
she eventually got help from president john voice coach and said it is one of the reasons she has done less public speaking since then
ro we also recalled the frustration of seeing situations in which she knew she only had partial information but the information she had made her that injustice was
and she recognized that unless something was crisis sometimes she would have so much to do that she would simply select an item something she could that would on which she thought she could make little progress on given day
this she came to view as an approach that was less than she would have liked and in fact she said kicked myself lot for not having more of strategic plan about systems and for or
but was indeed factor and was sometimes an understandable motivation too
om se bo kc hi ld ren she and her husband were home and like everyone else needed money and got sick and all the problems that happen in
looking back ro we said was not miserable but it was constant
ro we said was learning my and sometimes was
rewards not one to dwell on the negative ro we pointed out you asked me about the wonderful side of
she said she was without good boss or good
and she remembers getting letters five years after helping someone
sometimes she said visitor would come in with seemingly hopeless situation and she could not think of anything else to do other than to suggest he return the following week
sometimes visitors like that came back and say settled out
sure you gave me this wonderful idea
this she said happened lot and served to remind her that some people only need to and be questioned even if you have any idea
ro we summarized liked being catalyst
and catalysts always succeed but they are often enormously
ro we said she also likes puzzles and sees the organizational ombudsman role as being an endless chess game
in addition she said liked almost everybody that ever met and had job where was meeting lot of people
elaborated on the value to her of having great ombudsman colleagues at mit all of whom were people of color guaranteed was going to learn lot
for example clarence williams and thomas helped her realize the importance of avoiding expressing anger at others at mit while functioning in the ombudsman role
and she cited to ni reading and memorizing all the various sometimes conflicting policies and regulations at mit and creating compilation that is now given to every new department
ro we commented what it was like to have colleague like that
finally mary ro we has also had the opportunity to do something in this job that she dearly loves write
she is likely the most widely published organizational ombudsman practitioner in the world on matters of ombudsman theory and practice
she continues to write articles and recently has collaborated with howard gad lin on book chapter about the organizational ombudsman role
partial list of her publications is available at the mit om buds office web site

according to the michigan state university office of the ombudsperson web site office was the first office of its kind at any large university in the country and today remains the longest continuously operating college or university ombudsman office in the
the section of the web site also indicates that president clift on whart on appointed carolyn st ie ber as the second university ombudsman at

she explained that many were seniors graduate students or medical students
also she said that medical students were fearful and in need of place to discuss their concerns

the road to early in her tenure in the ombudsman office st ie ber remembers getting call from someone inviting her to attend an informal meeting of midwest area university ombudsmen

the person said that it was lot of
st ie ber remarked amusingly sound like fun to me so thought of an excuse about being too busy with my work including my continued teaching
but year or two later she received call from colleague at the university of michigan most likely don peri go who also appears in this article and they got together with few other colleagues for
another meeting took place at kent state university where she remembers those present experiencing an visit to the site where the national guard had killed four student protesters on may
she recalled meeting at southern illinois in carbondale il in which ombudsman in grid clarke encouraged the group to consider creating something haphazard than what been doing year after
st ie ber characterized clarke as mother of for these efforts
in an article she wrote while president st ie ber she also credited the plans of leon miller ombudsman from northern illinois university as having spark the organization into personal communication january
by the dream of establishing an official organization known as the university and college ombudsman association was finally accomplished
in the first annual meeting held at wayne state university in detroit in bylaws were developed and officers were elected
she recalls that ombudsman scholar professor larry hill of the university of oklahoma counted the votes
st ie ber was elected to serve on the board of directors
in its meeting in boulder co this still mostly midwest ombudsman was over how to include california ombudsmen in their goal of creating truly national organization
fairly large group of california ombudsmen had been holding their own meetings since at as il omar in pacific grove ca

sat in the chair and had
eventually an agreement was reached to coordinate meeting dates between and which allowed the new california colleagues to join and attend meetings
as st ie ber explained this allowed to
it also allowed colleagues from the midwest and elsewhere to attend the meetings in pacific grove
the availability of these two uniquely different professional development opportunities has continued to benefit higher education ombudsmen ever since
om peri go university of michigan pioneering contributions hazel cal ho un who was university of michigan first ombudsman was only in the job for about two years before she passed away from lung cancer
don peri go the second ombudsman did not start until but served in the role for years
peri go was among the first group of midwest ombudsman colleagues who began gathering informally for number of years and in form the university and college ombudsman association
he hosted first conference in ann arbor in served as treasurer on its first board of directors and the next year served as president
origins of um ombudsman office according to peri go in addition to the more common times on and valve for students to solve rationales for starting an ombudsman office at um another appears to have been important as well rivalry with michigan state university
according to peri go during late meeting of the um board of regents one of the board members turned to vice president and said understand has an ombudsman office
the vice president reportedly said me check on that and get back to
when the answer turned out to be within year or two the um office was established
before he started working in the office of the ombudsman peri go had returned to um to work on in counseling
he also served in halftime position as the director of student orientation
peri go said he did not really know what the ombudsman job would entail other than the fact that it involved dealing with people who had problems
after months in two half time jobs he left his position in orientation to assume the ombudsman office role fulltime
om campus relationships and one memorable ase while in his role as director of orientation peri go had formed many important relationships
of particular value were his relationships with academic administrators
in fact even after he became ombudsman he was the only nonfaculty member to chair the academic services board asb which was advisory to the vice president for academic affairs
he credits the relationships he formed on this committee for increasing his credibility with this group and that made it much when in his ombudsman role he needed to call someone to discuss problem
and he thought of an example
peri go shared story that he said brings tears to my
this was one of many situations about which he learned involving the exploitation of international students
he received frantic telephone call from the wife of foreign graduate student who said her husband was
he was in small specialized medical department
she said her husband had been responsible for bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars in research grants to lab
after three years the student wanted to pursue different postdoctoral fellowship in slightly different area at another university
despite his enormous success for reasons he could not understand he had not been admitted to any of the schools to which he had applied
one day department secretary arranged for him to secretly retrieve from trash can copy of the letter being sent by his advisor to university in california
the student finally understood why he had been receiving so many rejections
the letter said terrible things about him eg know who would ever want to hire hard to get along etc
peri go knew the om buds at the university to which the student was applying and called him to ask if he might have access to and be willing to review letters of recommendation for potential applicants
the ombudsman said yes and agreed to look at the application file to see if there was letter from this professor about the student in question
half an hour later the ombudsman from the other university called back confirming suspicion in disbelief that anyone would write such letter of recommendation
this is where well established relationships with academic administrators paid off
he contacted the dean who he knew from the asb committee and explained the situation
the dean agreed to contact professor he knew in the lab next door to inquire about the student
when he did the professor verified that the student was
the dean agreed with suggestion that he the dean write any future letters of recommendation on behalf of this student
peri go conveyed to the student that the dean would like to write letter on the behalf
the student was admitted to the next school to which he applied
the day the student and his family moved away the dean made contact with the professor who had written the terrible letters of
om reputation for helping after serving in the role for time peri go began to look not only at patterns of problems but for ways to try to prevent these issues from continuing to occur
as an example he cited financial aid problems and tuition classification instate versus out of state problems
he reached out to the director of financial aid someone he considered friend and asked if he might put on workshops for the financial aid office staff
after doing that he says staff in that office our best
soon staff from other offices eg the student accounts office began to quietly tell students help you but if you go to the ombudsman office they might be able to
challenges when asked about challenges he faced as an ombudsman peri go cited learning not worry about work related things at home or to invite people to call him at home about non emergency matters
he also mentioned that he used to be asked to play roles that he eventually decided not to play eg observer in siti ns or office takeovers etc
om bels on con cordia university pioneering contributions not long after being hired as an ombudsman at con cordia university in montreal canada suzanne bels on attended an informal meeting with college and university ombudsmen from the midwestern us in salt fork oh
upon returning from this meeting she decided that canadian college and university om buds persons should host conference
the first one was held in and bels on believes it was larger than any previous conference of college and university om buds persons
it included both canadians and americans
this initiative eventually led to second conference in and to the formation of what became the association of canadian college and university om buds persons
in bels on and dale ne pride of the ohio state university om buds office cochaired the first north american ombudsman leadership forum which brought together number of ombudsman organizations including the association of canadian college and university om buds persons the california caucus of college and university om buds the ombudsman association toa canadian parliamentary ombudsman cpo the university and college om buds association and the united states ombudsman association
in she served as the conference planner for the second meeting in san francisco involving most of these same organizations as well as the national association of state long term care ombudsman programs
when bels on left her position at con cordia after more than years she could not have chosen another ombudsman position in more different kind of organization
she and the late liz ho ff man previously ombudsperson at the university of toronto are the only two canadian higher education om buds persons who after leaving their university posts worked in civilian roles as om buds persons for the department of national defense canadian forces
according to bels on this was remarkable for couple of self described
bels on worked there from to
while there she worked with andre mar in now the ombudsman for the province of ontario and keynote speaker for conference in new orleans la
om se boko rig in of office in nearly decade before she became an ombudsperson suzanne bels on was passing by in cab and saw it computer punch cards out the of building on the campus of what is now con cordia university then sir george williams university which later combined with loy ola college to form con cordia
this event known as the centre riot of was the result of black and white student frustration over the handling of allegations of racism against professor
according to bels on this event which resulted in what was then the largest financial damages at any north american university over led to the creation of the ombudsman office by the board of governors in the spring of and eventually job for her
the university was seeking rational and fair way to deal with student grievances
and there was already canadian precedent for this idea because according to the web site in its of section the first ombudsman office in north america had been established at simon fraser university in british columbia in and later at universities in alberta ontario and nova scotia as well
bels on was recent con cordia graduate when she began serving as ombudsperson in
she started with two year nonrenewable contract and after several changes in status over the years wound up with one that was renewable and reviewed every five
fortunately the economic stability afforded by the eventual arrangement allowed bels on to do things like own home and to have an actual career as an ombudsperson
challenges in the early years of her work as ombudsperson bels on encountered what she called usual for college or university ombudsperson ie how to publicize the office how to help student population that changes by yearly and how to deal with respondents who did not appreciate her role or those who ignored her recommendations
however she said she was able to rely on the university catalogue and when necessary would threaten to up the ie raise the issue with higher level administrators
but bels on reiterated challenges are perennial for any
legal issues suzanne bels on may well be the only college or university ombudsperson ever subpoenaed to participate in murder trial
according to an article by mara bo vs un in the online new york daily news the defendant former con cordia university tenured faculty member fab rik ant four colleagues and wounded secretary on august
according to bels on professor fab rik ant who represented himself in court wanted her to testify about matter having nothing to do with the murders for which he was on trial
he wanted information about someone he believed had complained to her about him
bels on spoke with the crown prosecutor and told the judge she was not prepared to release any details about anything unrelated to the murder trial
fortunately for bels on the judge agreed
om se bo kc hang es according to bels on the canadian higher education om buds persons based their operational procedures on the classical ombudsman model
her office had what she called and powerful terms of and it was by the board of with the power to investigate which many other offices did not have
bels on said that in her first meeting with other om buds persons hosted by walt craig of the ohio state university and attended by among others carolyn st ie ber of michigan state university it appeared to her that everyone in attendance working in the same
but by the seemed to for many of the us colleagues and there appeared to be greater emphasis on confidentiality and concern about being dragged into
she believes this led to the growth of the organizational ombudsman model and to significant differences in the way canadian and us higher education ombudsmen practice
professional networking as founding member of two different ombudsman organizations bels on is believer in the value of networking
her relationships in grew out of the circumstance that as ombudsmen working mostly in small offices were not many others to whom they could about challenges they faced in their work
and she said she often got good ideas from these colleagues on policies practices etc
and she found these interactions invaluable
bels on was also founding member of the forum of canadian ombudsman which according to its web site is organization to permit people to share information and views and to promote the ombudsman concept across
offers variety of courses throughout the year
bels on has observed that many people attending courses been working for years and had never talked to anyone outside their own
not surprisingly is frequently cited as the most valuable aspect of courses
for most people means leaving behind their professional lives and many if not all of their professional connections
this does not apply to suzanne bels on
although she is no longer an ombudsman as founding member of she still counts lot of the people with whom she worked in as good friends
and she has found way to remain closely connected to as even in she has acted as conference planner for the biannual joint conferences of and the
and she helps plan the multiple course offerings annually as well
after years of working as an ombudsman in both university and military settings when talking with her about the work her passion for the ombudsman profession is unmistakable
not surprisingly she still thinks about cases
and while there were of course few she wishes she could have handled differently she clearly has made significant and positive difference in the lives of thousands of people who when they felt they had been treated unfairly had the good fortune of asking for her help
one would be hard pressed to find more dedicated ombudsman professional than suzanne bels on
om gad lin university of massachusetts and univ ers it of california angeles pioneering contributions howard gad lin is one of small number of people to have served in the ombudsman role for more than years and is also one of only few who has worked in more than one sector
he worked at the university of massachusetts university of california angeles and is currently employed at the national institutes of health
while at the university of massachusetts um ass soon after being trained as mediator he found himself mediating sexual harassment case
he later published an often cited article about the experience in managing such delicate mediation gad lin
in the late gad lin served as president of
in he left um ass to take another ombudsman position at uc la
according to his online profile at mediate
com while at uc la was also director of the uc la conflict mediation program and codirector of the center for the study and resolution of inter ethnic interracial conflict
while in angeles he served as well as consulting ombudsman to the angeles county museum of
in he coauthored with elizabeth walsh pino monograph on the topic of neutrality which is still given to participants in of organizational ombudsman course
as result of his many publications including numerous journal articles book chapters and his frequent presentations and talks at various conferences he has become one of the most influential and widely recognized organizational ombudsmen in the world
in gad lin left uc la to start the national institutes of health office of the ombudsman and his success at more than deserves separate article
he is the subject of dozen videos on the web site mediate
and he is featured in one called mediators views from the eye of the series which according to the web site features of the most experienced mediators in the
om skeptic to ombudsman when els worth bernard was named the first university ombudsman at the university of massachusetts in he visited number of other faculty members to discuss his new role
one of them was young activist from the department of psychology named howard gad lin
gad lin still remembers bernard as incredible wonderful but believes bernard may have specifically visited with him because of his in political activism on
gad lin had been the leader of the strike in the spring of after the killing of four student protesters by the national guard at kent state university
as he explained activism was connected to students power and rights issues as well as to the political
in fact gad lin admits that at the time bernard visited with him he was skeptical of the whole idea of the
in the late after bernard ended his service as ombudsman friend and colleague of janet from the department of legal studies assumed the role for two terms
as she was leaving the position she spoke with him about his possible interest in the position
he was eventually selected for this job and ironically later learned that his history of activism was part of the reason he got it
as he told the author the joint committee of faculty students and administrators making the recommendation to the chancellor wanted someone was not afraid to speak up to the
he said it made sense then in way then that it may not now because there was much more between students on the one hand and administration on the other with the faculty often in between
so in howard gad lin became the third ombudsman at um ass in am her st
tenured faculty member who genuinely enjoyed his work in the department of psychology gad lin accepted the ombudsman position expecting to serve only one or two two year terms
thirty two years later he is still an ombudsman
earl cases gad ln remembers having couple staff workplace cases during his first week on the job
he said that despite his background in group dynamics and sensitivity training and the training gotten in individual and family therapy he quickly thought to himself boy
and although he remembers helping the boss and employee he was assisting to put together an agreement he called janet and asked where he could get mediation training
referred him to woman named alb ie davis who ran mediation training program and gad lin still remembers the trainers in her program as
he also recalled early cases involving grading disputes and questions about how allegations of academic dishonesty were handled
he worked with others in proposing joint faculty student committee to handle these
he remembers original process gave an awful lot of power to faculty to act
om se bo kg ad lin had stepped out of the union upon accepting the ombudsman role but he also remembers developing good working relationship with head of the faculty union
in fact he said there was meeting in the late in which the head of the union at the university of massachusetts presentation on the ombudsman office from the perspective of the faculty
perhaps week after returning from his mediation training gad lin recalls doing mediation involving professor and student involving sexual harassment
he said power dynamics and the issues were especially interesting and
he went on to explain that this gave him appreciation of the potential value of mediation because it was the kind of situation in which there was sufficient ambiguity that was hard to imagine that any formal inquiry process could have led to better
furthermore both parties and their representatives were quite satisfied with the outcome
he wrote about this experience in an article in the negotiation journal gad lin
earl affiliations and influences gad lin remembers meeting number of other ombudsmen at meeting of mostly midwest ombudsmen in detroit
those included ed sharp les from wayne state don peri go from the university of michigan carolyn st ie ber from michigan state university in grid clarke from southern illinois dave he at on from ohio university and mary ro we from mit
he characterized this meeting as unstructured but said it was and
he added that learning that they were out there was helpful and knowing we were going to be meeting
gad lin also encountered some of these colleagues at society of professional in dispute resolution meetings
and the following year he also learned about and began to attend the meeting of the california caucus of college and university om buds in pacific grove ca
to say that howard gad lin is would be an understatement
as an academic he told the author he saw the ombudsman role the context of the conflict resolution field
and he that many of the more interesting ideas came from listening to people who were working in different organizational contexts than the ombudsman
he liked connecting with larger group of academics trying to understand both and the dynamics of conflict
when asked about his early influences in addition to janet alb ie davis and the aforementioned ombudsman colleagues he cited colleague at um ass ethan kats ch who he said currently runs the center for technology and dispute resolution
he also mentioned austin sar at from am her st college who some early famous work on dispute
and he mentioned bar nett pearce and vernon cr on en who wrote book called the coordinated management of meaning which was partly based on field studies of mediation
he even worked with some of these colleagues in supervising students doing these studies
he said it was in which to work
om se bo kt ran siti on to uc la and fulltime om buds ing when asked when it occurred to him that om buds ing might become new career for him gad lin said pivotal point was when had the offer from
he was drawn both to uc la and to the west coast
but unlike the um ass where only tenured faculty members were considered for the role at uc la the ombudsman could not be tenured faculty member
he said the people at uc la saw this as conflict of interest
for gad lin this meant the prospect of giving up tenure which as he said not something one does
so he negotiated one year leave of absence at um ass to be sure he wanted to do this
he characterized this move as both and
however by the end of his first year at uc la things were going well and he made the decision to give up his tenured position at um ass
he worked at uc la for the next seven years before moving back to the east coast to start the ombudsman office in bethesda md
reflections looking back gad lin remembered becoming aware early in his time as an ombudsman that as faculty member he had been really isolated from what was happening in the rest of the university
in hindsight he said he can see what he had on things and how unaware he had been of the ways in which others view faculty both positively and negatively
and he found the diversity of people with whom he came into contact in this role to be fascinating
could be talking with some full professor one minute and guy sweeping the floors another
he thinks the ombudsman role uniquely combines his psychologist in the complexity of human with his activist in social structure and social
he contrasted doing therapy you get one with the ombudsman position where one often gets multiple perspectives from people who are in conflict with one another
and not surprisingly he told the author candidly that he still loves what he does

om se bo km ar sha wagner columbia university pioneering contributions marsha wagner established the om buds office at columbia university and served for years in the role of om buds officer
according to an october article in om buds wagner during that time she also served three terms on the toa board of directors and chaired the toa professional development committee for six years
and she served on the board of directors and chaired the ethics standards and best practices committee
in addition she helped establish the first certification program for organizational om buds and served as the president of the board of certification
she has also published several articles of relevance to organizational ombudsmen one on the om buds as change agent and another on apologies
according to an october article in the online columbia spectator the om buds office handled cases during her tenure
origins of the office at columbia according to wagner in the on civility and mutual at columbia university was concerned about number of recent incidents involving public insults among student groups
and the results of campus civility survey suggested that number of groups actually felt targeted by others
for example some student athletes complained that professors or classmates seemed to view them as jocks reading the newspaper in the back row of
such as the one at the university of michigan had not passed judicial scrutiny
and many of the issues brought to the ee oaf firma action person while obviously were not related to and therefore not illegal
so the idea of creating an om buds office gained traction
in fact according to wagner some members of the columbia university community even met with mary ro we to explore this idea
om se bo kin formal channels
there was great hope that the om buds officer would make positive difference in some of the the campus was experiencing
early on after becoming om buds officer wagner made the decision not to be present for campus siti ns but rather to serve as resource for people to deal with the
and with respect to even though people understood those whose speech had offended them had free speech rights wagner provided safe place for them to discuss exactly how they had been affected by it and also safe place to explore options about what if anything they wanted to do
challenges early on wagner learned she could have exercised options eg writing letter to the president which would likely highlight problem areas in way that might increase distrust of the om buds office by leaders with whom she wanted to have long term cooperative working relationship
she consulted with more experienced colleagues such as mary ro we and howard gad lin and found it enormously helpful to do so
she developed more diplomatic ways of identifying issues
at one point in the early years few deans seemed to see the office as
they told her they would matters themselves and declined to answer questions
she learned to respond by saying in essence talk with the president about this he will ask me what the dean said
do you want me to tell him what you said
collegial support and professional development wagner emphasized the importance of having other ombudsman colleagues with whom she could consult
this network expanded when she joined
and she had more frequent opportunities to develop collegial relationships with colleagues when the east coast om buds group ec og formed including linda wi lc ox harvard medical school wilbur hicks princeton university john bark at pace university and ju di seg all stony brook university
finally wagner expanded her own support network even further when after decade on the job she hired her first om buds office colleague associate director wayne blair who is currently the university om buds at the university of north carolina chapel hill
before even starting her position wagner attended toa conference
and soon thereafter she joined the teaching team for course
she remembers tom fur ta do from united technologies corporation wendell jones from sandia national laboratories and elizabeth clark from up john as colleagues from whom she learned lot
when she became board member for toa and later for wagner discovered that unlike her ombudsman role where she was most definitely not decision maker she actually enjoyed being decision maker
as wagner continued to develop as practitioner she came to believe strongly in the need for organizational ombudsmen to develop professional practices across

below is the text of his remarks dear fellow members of the columbia community it is not often that we have occasion to honor the service of someone who has held senior post in university administration for more than two decades as the only occupant and who was herself central to its creation
yet that is the case for marsha wagner who is retiring as university om buds officer after twenty two years
since marsha has helped thousands of columbia students faculty and staff resolve myriad of concerns by encouraging them to consider new alternatives or enlist univ er resources they may not have known existed
more often than not those who sought her assistance achieved resolution without direct intervention from the om buds office
her vocation has been to help us live and work together as community more productively and with greater equanimity
marsha first arrived at columbia in as an assistant professor of east asian languages and cultures and later became director of the starr east asian library
long before becoming om buds officer she helped bring coeducation to columbia college
she also was leader in developing policy against sexual harassment and successfully advocated for extending employee benefits to same sex partners
it is testament to the progress made under the stewardship of marsha and other university leaders that these advances now seem perfectly commonplace to many columbia ns
whether measured by the duration of her service the number of students faculty and staff members she has known and supported or the fact that each of her children and their spouses holds columbia degree marsha wagner has been an exemplary member of the columbia family
on behalf of all those at this university whose lives she has touched want to thank her and wish her all the best as she embarks on this next chapter of her life
om lei den frost office of the austrian student ombudsman present pioneering contributions although there were two individuals who each served two year terms before him lei den frost is by far the longest serving ombudsman in the history of the austrian student ombudsman office
according to lei den frost there are only two university ombudsmen in austrian universities out of institutions of higher education
the office of the austrian student ombudsman investigates complaints and concerns primarily from university students all over austria constituents
when the office began in lei den frost started in it consisted of one person
under his leadership the office staff has increased in size to total of six fulltime employees four ombudsmen and two secretaries
lei den frost has played pivotal role in the life of the european network of ombudsmen in higher education
according to the online occasional papers and news he attended the first meeting in amsterdam which took place in hosted two of its annual meetings in vienna in and involving some participants each and has edited or coedited eight editions of the occasional papers including occasional paper no
which he coauthored with hol trop former ombudsman at the university of amsterdam about the origins of and their first meeting in amsterdam in hol trop and lei den frost
independent legal status according to an editorial in the edition of the online news lei den frost after about eight years of intense lobbying the student ombudsman of austria was accorded independent legal status in march of
this is in itself pioneering achievement
gives the ombudsman the right to request information from the governing bodies and members of institutes of higher education impose new obligation upon them to provide information allow the ombudsman to act as an advisor to the relevant authorities at the institutional levels and require the publication of an annual report to be submitted to the minister and to the national council parliament
om se boke no he beginnings jos ef lei den frost received an invitation from hol trop ombudsman at the university of amsterdam in the netherlands to attend meeting of higher education ombudsmen in february
according to lei den frost was kind of thing at the very
starting in hol trop invited all of the european higher education ombudsmen she could identify to attend the meeting
although hol trop was the initiator she was supported by others including the austrian student ombudsman lei den frost
according to the online occasional paper hol trop and lei den frost more than people came to the meeting
at the first meeting from various european higher education institutions discussed their experiences and exchanged views
european and international comparisons were made and international potential for cooperation was examined in the areas of mediation complaint management campus conflict resolution and arbitration
in addition to his ombudsman position and all his activities jos ef has attended conferences and the joint ac cu oe no he conference in vienna as well
his rare and extraordinary efforts in connecting with other university and college ombudsmen model genuine commitment to the principle of becoming an ombudsman in the international community

and several others interviewed for this article hart sock wall ace st ie ber and she lt on described the role as rather similar to that of classical ombudsmen
this was consistent with the conception presented in the wall street journal article referenced at the beginning of this article ie quite similarly to the scandinavian model of the
st ie ber provocatively referenced this change in the title of an article in the negotiation journal when she raised the question varieties has the ombudsman concept been diluted
and she did offer broad ideas about possible reasons for this evolution
she wrote is not surprising that along the way the fundamental role has evolved in response to local cultures and changing st ie ber

and how did the increasing threat of ombudsmen being subpoenaed or deposed affect it
were there other forces at work
several articles on the differences between classical and organizational ombudsmen are referenced in the on the web site
but toward the end of better understanding how these differences evolved from the classical to the organizational approach additional inquiry appears worthy of further consideration
there are numerous other organizational ombudsman pioneers worthy of interviewing for future editions of
some of these practice in different sectors eg corporate government nongovernmental organizations health care and religious organizations
others are pioneers because of their individual contributions to the field regardless of sector
it was profound privilege to speak with this group of pioneers of higher education om buds ing
during the interviews it was fascinating to hear them make reference to meeting one another and to the sense of comfort they almost universally experienced in finding others engaged in the same kind of work
early informal meetings of colleagues in the midwest and on the california coast were small enough that approximately years later many of them still remember meeting each other for the first time
while the world of higher education om buds ing has certainly grown since the late it is still relatively small
without doubt the influence of these pioneers has been enormous

organizational om buds are neutrals but what does and mean in the context of other professions and what implications might those alternative meanings have for ombudsman practice
this paper analyzes the standard of neutrality and impartiality by leveraging findings from the diverse fields of moral philosophy historical analysis political science systems theory mathematical modeling social cognitive psychology and neuropsychology among others
it can be daunting task to explore profession as tightknit and communal as the organizational om bud man field which is why it is so impressive and so vital that the following individuals have given freely of their time their encouragement and their frank advice
must we always be neutral where our neighbors are concerned for meddling is fault helping is
william pen nan organizational ombudsman reading william quote might respond that in an work it is always necessary for the to remain as neutral as possible
that is an office must necessarily function by not taking the side of one person or organizational unit over another and must do this to maintain credibility as an office all individuals within their organization can candidly trust
after all one of the international ombudsman four pillars of practice is and and this cornerstone has stood for many years as foundation of ombudsman practice in the united states and beyond
specifically the stan dard of neutrality and impartiality serves as clear indication for both organizations in which offices operate and for those who use services that organizational om buds will always strive for fairness and by remaining not on behalf of any or unit within an organization for fair and equitably administered not being affiliated with any organizational compliance functions roles that might otherwise compromise neutrality or associations that create actual or perceived conflicts of and by not having any interest or in the issues with which they deal
of the role and field make it important to periodically reexamine the neutrality impartiality and other standards and to thereby lay the foundation for discussion about those ongoing relevance to everyday practice
this paper attempts to do just that not by diving deeply into any one aspect of the neutrality and impartiality standard but instead by surveying different aspects of the standard both conceptually and pragmatically and by leveraging findings from the diverse fields of moral philosophy historical analysis scientific research methodology political science systems theory mathematical modeling social cognitive psychology and neuropsychology in turn
the seemingly straightforward definitions of the terms and present host of questions important to explore
the oxford dictionary literally defines as state of not supporting or helping either side in and of decided views expression or strong
interestingly the dictionary also lists as synonymous with neutrality
so then is state of not supporting individuals inherent to the goals of an office
if means to not help then is an effectively prevented from taking sides on any issue when developing options for conflict resolution
further offices play many helping roles as trainers coaches fac il ita tors of dialogue and communicators of systemic trends
what do those roles mean for the neutrality of the role
perhaps more importantly should it be goal of an to not judge their visitors or to not allow emotional reactions to affect their judgment
as has been written about by experienced practitioners om buds as humans will naturally always experience emotion when making judgments
so then what is the line to be drawn in preventing emotional reactions from clouding attempts at
these questions may seem bit esoteric but the larger point is that in order to fully understand and interact with the standards it is important to examine the very definitions of words used in the standards themselves such an examination can and does provide basis of understanding the fundamental ideas communicated within the standard of neutrality and impartiality and throughout this paper references will be made to the definitions of the terms used the questions those definitions pose and the implications thereof
as practiced organizational om buds can likely attest the standard of neutrality and impartiality is not exclusive to the domain and in fact shares origins with other elements of alternative dispute resolution specifically mediation
while there are important differences between typical mediation and ombudsman work eg not maintaining written records lack of privilege and others many skills and techniques are used in both practices
some writings have even emphasized how om buds can promote procedural fairness by leveraging in no small part tools used primarily in mediation settings
arbitrators and adjudicators too incorporate elements of neutrality and impartiality into their practices and often derive legitimacy from perceptions of their neutrality and impartiality despite the obvious difference that they oversee formal processes and come to binding conclusions about conflicts
unlike other conflict resolution practitioners however organizational om buds are required to maintain appearances of neutrality in everything they do professionally including what associations and intraoffice connections they form
further some practitioners have argued that much as in mediation processes procedural and substantive fairness may only be achieved when om buds work hard to develop and consistently apply skill sets that allow parties to be treated with equanimity respect and mutual appreciation
these differences set apart the standard of neutrality and impartiality as distinct from those in other conflict resolution professions and imply need to address how these unique standards should play out as om buds interact with other individuals in their organizations
finally it is important to note that some scholars and leading practitioners have begun to openly advocate for adopting stances of or toward parties as opposed to remaining neutral and have emphasized that organizational conflict management and learning is best promoted by who nonetheless openly identify with all perspectives
international variants of the standard of course analyzing definitions and comparing to arbitrator only advances discussion so far and to fully understand the standard of neutrality and impartiality it is important to consider the international context within which it resides
many international ombudsman associations have standards parallel to standards to which outline various facets of how an is to remain neutral and impartial
for example the ombudsman as sociation formerly the british and irish ombudsman association lists as standards that om buds are arbiters and not
the african ombudsman association contrastingly lists and as two of its six basic requirements for ombudsman offices and conspicuously does not use the term at all
too have similar standards for instance the office of the ombudsman in hong kong lists as operating standards the and impartial of grievances
and many other examples exist some aligning directly with the and terminology of the standards and some not
two overarching points are evident from brief review of current international ombudsman standards
first there is an almost universal emphasis on need for some element of or system by which to intake assess and manage cases
this is not to say that one should interpret international ombudsman standards to conflate the terms and because in fact the terms while similar have important differences but that elements of these similar concepts can be found almost universally in ombudsman offices worldwide
second and perhaps more significantly there is no uniform international standard of using the specific words or even though that terminology can be found in other organizations and offices worldwide
further when these terms are used the context and implication of their usage varies greatly
finally it seems that standard which em the responsibility to consider the concerns and interests of all individuals affected by the matter under consideration emphasis stands out as unique phrasing in that it explicitly emphasizes an approach considering the interests of all parties to dispute even though such an approach is tacitly emphasized in the standards of other ombudsman affiliations and offices around the world
as if international variations of the neutrality and impartiality standard were not enough many different fields outside dispute resolution when taken together offer an additional layer of insight into how these standards may or may not be effectively applied to the role
for thousands of years philosophers historians and scientific observers of nature have debated neutrality in all its forms
indeed some of the most noted historiographers are prized for their ability to recount events from relatively neutral perspectives as compared to their contemporaries
yet in the field of historical studies there are many experts who question the ability of their field to remain in its approach because of the biases inherent to any observer of events
perhaps more poignantly philosophers for hundreds of years and of varying orientations have questioned the ability of an individual to ever adopt perspective citing for their argumentation the myriad effects of personal experiences limited information regarding events and other factors that prevent an objective neutrality from ever being possible
modern scientists too openly question the ability to conduct studies of nature without bias or misinterpretation of key information and do so based on many of the same premises expressed by philosophers and historians
varied perspectives illuminate fundamental dilemma inherent to the notion of neutrality one must be able to guarantee that they can always be objective if they are to attain neutral perspective
indeed is listed as goal for practitioners in standard of practice
and yet om buds must interact with constituents who represent differing perspectives who may provide incomplete or inaccurate information explaining those perspectives and who may thus skew any objective stance an might obtain
another question from this analysis becomes does an objective view imply the need to also be impartial
in other words in order to achieve measure of objectivity and thus neutrality must an be able to simultaneously understand all sides to disagreement without making any judgments about them
this would present problem for the standard of objectivity because in practice of course om buds make mental assessments all the time
according to scholars from several fields it is inherently impossible to not do so
neutrality and impartiality in political science one might wonder how an role can be informed by studies of political science and yet an must navigate factions alliances and power imbalances in much the same way as politician does
parallel to many view that it is practically impossible to neutrally review events one observes many political scientists question whether any member of political system no matter what efforts that person might take to remove themselves from its effects can possibly avoid its biasing influences
given this perspective the question then becomes whether it is possible for an office to remain wholly in any given dispute given that organizations are often inherently comprised of factions and groups politically aligned with particular ideas leaders and cultural norms
many political scientists would succinctly say
further even if an were able to remain completely unbiased by organizational politics there would likely still remain instances where those politics require some sort of advocacy in order to ensure fair outcomes
archbishop des mo nd tutu in speaking out against the apart he id regime of south africa once wrote you are neutral in situations of injustice you have chosen the side of the oppressor
if an elephant has its foot on the tail of mouse and you say that you are neutral the mouse will not appreciate your
william echoed these words in the opening quote to this piece
even some wellknown practitioners have begun to question whether or not an can effectively pursue organizational justice and fairness if prevented from advocating for individuals who may be unfairly affected by organizational policies or procedures
after all standard specifically states that no shall on behalf of any in their work
this provision may be interpreted to preclude advocacy for example in situations where organizational bureaucracy has created procedural injustices which might continue but for involvement
studies in systems theory and mathematics suggest that practicable neutrality and impartiality may be impossible by nature of the sheer complexity of effects the actions of an individual produces
for many decades now systems theorists have studied the often complex interconnected relationships that comprise organizations and have modeled those relationships to better understand affect and predict organizational behavior
one finding of system theorists is that when analyzed within the context of many interactions within an organization the behavioral effects of one individual on other individuals tends to vary greatly over time
that is under standing and predicting the behavioral effects of one or few individuals within an organization is incredibly complex to model or predict
indeed some mathematicians have begun attempt ing to map the dynamics of simple two person conflict systems using nonlinear equations and while progress is being made there is still much to learn regarding the complex dynamical processes involved in conflicts between individuals let alone entire organizations
in light of this ongoing research the fundamental question facing organizational om buds becomes whether or not practitioners can ever fully understand the effects of their actions on visitors organizational subunits management or the organization at large
the next questions then become can an ever fully ensure that the effects of their actions result in and impacts on the people they serve
if an organizational ombudsman cannot fully ensure the neutrality of their behavior is it even possible for offices to predict how their actions will affect organizational perceptions of them
practically speaking it may well be impossible for organizational om buds to be able to predict whether their actions produce neutral organizational effects or how those organizational effects influence perceptions of their office
if this is the case then are there any other standards other than neutrality that an might use that may be better suited to the complex organizational environments in which many om buds find themselves
finally one might argue that these questions could apply to any standard of conduct and they likely could but standard of in particular seems particularly difficult to achieve given the context of this analysis
research in the fields of social cognitive psychology and neuropsychology portrays an increasingly complex picture of the human brain how individuals assess conflicts and the ability of an to apply or in any situation
one wellknown aspect of social psychology research is that of that is distortions in how individuals view situations which are often determined by preexisting assumptions about the people or situations with which person interacts
sense of right and wrong as well as subjective interpretations of standards of practice including neutrality and impartiality
long established psychological research shows that such subjective interpretations of role affect not only the way in which person makes decisions eg deciding how to proceed with case but also how person perceives those with whom they interact eg visitors to an office
further cultural and experiential differences including the demographic characteristics and life experiences of an and his or her visitors directly affect both how the ombudsman perceives their visitors and how given visitor perceives them
cognitive biases are also exacerbated by perceived or real and resulting stress which include for example the real or perceived threats of being attacked oppressed or otherwise maligned that often drive visitors to offices in the first place
further recent research in neuropsychology shows that when an individual even listens to descriptions of situations where others are under stress parts of the brain activate as if they were in the situation themselves
thus as visitor to an office recounts details of their story on neuronal level the themselves may that story experience the exacerbated cognitive biases that vicarious stress produces and thus subconsciously be inhibited from accurately perceiving and responding to the conflict situation
of course the psychological realities of the role nonetheless do not preclude many practitioners from carrying out their daily responsibilities in fair and effective manner
what current research in the psychology arena does suggest though is that making goal of assessing and handing cases in purely objective neutral and impartial manner is likely not possible and perhaps even inefficient and inappropriate
there is an evident disconnect between the natural subjectivity that skews the perspective of every person and goal of pure or
indeed even if an were to achieve such standard there is no way to control for the cognitively biased perceptions of visitors management and other stake holders as they form opinions regarding whether to trust and value an office
potential alternatives to the neutrality impartiality standard
in sum current research from many fields suggests that while the standard of neutrality and impartiality has served as strong conceptual basis for building credibility within organizations ever actually achieving neutrality or impartiality remains elusive at best
it seems then that perhaps it may be time to consider adopting alternative conceptions of principles similar to neutrality and impartiality if only framed in manner more realistically applicable by practitioners
it also seems necessary to distinguish between what an does in thinking about an individual or case and the process or actions an takes in response
an might assess case and quite another to study and understand the implications of how an organizational actions affect those around them
perhaps even more fundamentally many om buds are responsible for considering different factors at different stages in their case processes for instance being aware of how initial intake and mental case assessment diverges or dovetails with the ombudsman overall mission
current literature and discourse on the role of the assumes that considerations of neutrality and impartiality must necessarily both apply to all aspects of work when in fact the processes of an assessing situation and of taking action to respond to that situation are very different and may require different standards
moreover while the standards explaining neutrality and impartiality are not explicitly divided in this manner they can be effectively divided based upon the purpose they serve standards and speak to how an ombudsman thinks about and approaches their task standards and speak to the structural capacity and role of an and standards and speak to ways in which the ombudsman is to maintain impartiality and neutrality in their case management practices
the standards themselves then attempt to distinguish be tween how an analyzes and thinks about his or her role standards and and how an behaves within the context of an actual case standards and
it stands to reason that if the standards themselves reflect this distinction then so too should the encapsulating words and concepts used to summarize standards to collectively
new standard for an evolving role as organizational change agent
there is currently ongoing debate and scholarship regarding the shifting role of the as an agent of organizational change and process improvement which in itself presents implications for the standards of practice and which when interpreted in the context of this discussion seems to suggest the need to reconsider the neutrality and impartiality standard in particular
some proponents of adjusting the standards have pointed to scenarios where an organizational ombudsman may be required to serve as an advocate for individuals for instance in situations where an employee seeks an exemption to an organizational standard that would otherwise restrict them unfairly
some of these same authors have expressed concern that current standards unnecessarily limit the practitioner from serving in temporarily advocative roles where warranted
other writers have pointed to studies showing that conflict management systems can increase overall in organizations through recommendations for structural and procedural change which inherently assumes relatively active role and responsibility for the in addressing concerns of fairness in the first place
the standard of neutrality and impartiality places important limitations on practice it also seems to unnecessarily hinder organizational om buds from effectively assessing and responding to conflict situations in these new and evolving ways
this is then another limitation potentially imposed by standard which specifically limits an from on behalf of any individual within the
further it seems an unnecessary lim ita ti on that practitioners potentially be hindered in their abilities to communicate considerations of all interests to both employees and management as the current standards to might be interpreted
whereas now organizational om buds may be limited to only reporting and thus analysis free data from their aggregated work an alternative standard might provide the an unrestricted ability to add their analysis to the data they present
perhaps then it is important to begin profession wide dialogue around what if any standard might be more appropriate replacement as ombudsman practice continues to evolve toward the new conception of the role envisioned by numerous practitioners in the field
doing so may lead to standard that better promotes effective communication of an views regarding both emerging systemic trends and unintended consequences of organizational standards and procedures
this newfound leeway would allow offices to retain their fundamental value within their organizations while growing their reputations as effective business units
such an alternative standard might also thus serve as conceptual underpinning for the development of the role more effectively than does the standard of neutrality and impartiality now and may therefore present more coherent picture of the evolving role in the minds of organizational stake holders including office visitors and management
in this way new standard might even improve the ability of offices to be coherently perceived as for individuals to be critical and openly evaluative of organizational structures policies and management and as offices that will then take the feedback received and effectively communicate thoughts and recommendations to organizational leadership
this enhanced perception would likely increase abilities to learn about systemic problems to anticipate conflicts and tensions during times of organizational change and to work with organizational leaders to facilitate the communication of an ony mi zed feedback as it is received
it is important to note that none of these changes suggest that the function would could or should assume the functions of an organizational development practitioner ie implementing any new standards would only be aimed toward enabling offices to more effectively serve as conduits of communication not toward assisting offices to provide structured plans for process improvement
overall it seems reasonable that as the role evolves the neutrality and impartiality standard may grow increasingly insufficient and in need of reconsideration
this piece has covered much literature regarding the ways in which the role is evolving the potential of the profession at large and corresponding ways in which the current standards might need to adapt as the field matures
much current debate exists regarding the extent to which practitioners should remain neutral remain impartial and refrain from acting as advocates for people groups and policies
perhaps more fundamentally much discussion currently focuses on the future role of the within organizations and in particular on how to go about adding value through reporting systemic trends while also maintaining the confidentiality informality and perception of being that are so critical to practice
while many aspects of evolution remain to be seen what is clear is that as the field has grown practitioners have begun to clarify for themselves and for each other both what they think the role ought to entail as well as its potential limitations
impacts on professional ident it yo ne last consideration one that strikes at the heart of this process is what impacts such change in the profession is having on senses of professional identity and what those impacts might portend for the future of practice
in order to move forward the field will need to ask its members to introspect and determine the causes of any fears regarding potential change
important considerations include whether or not discussion of change is scary for current practitioners and if so from where those fears arise
the field is relatively nascent in some ways inchoate and the very role of an is specifically limited in scope so as to protect it as distinct and independent of the organizational hierarchy
these and other dynamics in the field may cause sense that progress to date might be threatened by attempts to reconsider current standards of practice
for instance the current expectations organizational leaders have regarding their offices is critical to those success and discussion of revisiting or trying to reorient those understandings may cause current practitioners to fear that their organizational leadership may not to such changes
another consideration given that the field is relatively new as compared to the other functions found in most organizations is whether or not revisiting common standards of practice will be seen by those in other organizational functions as sign of weakness that the field is disorganized and unclear or alternatively as sign of strength that the field is evolving and self clarifying
precisely because the field has advanced so far many current professionals may perceive they have lot to lose by reexamining the standards of their profession
are many questions to be answered but ultimately the power will always remain in the hands of the practitioners who guide the
the most fundamental question then becomes whether or not the role is evolving whether it is necessary as field to acknowledge that evolution and whether or not the standards must be adjusted to allow for that change
each practitioner must answer that question for themselves for it is they who will bear the brunt of any decision to modify current professional standards and norms
indeed each practitioner will likely find that the effects of any such changes impact them in varying degrees and in any case would largely depend upon their own personal decision to adapt how they view and execute their individual role
as with any other organizational change practitioners in the will need to believe in the potential value of any standards reconsideration before lending it their full support
while it remains to be seen whether or not the standards of neutrality impartiality and others will be revisited researchers and practitioners have discussed the implications of an evolving function including the evolutionary outcomes of keeping neutrality and impartiality standard for quite some time
it is dialogues such as these that will allow the field to grow and that will allow the function to expand while balancing the need to stay within its necessarily limited purview
perhaps then the ultimate goals for the field ought to be continuing to foster dialogue regarding possible need for change and continuing to encourage cross pollination with other fields
only then can alternative standards be thoroughly considered vetted and applied in new conceptions of the professional identity

katherine bi ala abstract attempting to capture the significant positive effects that an om buds office can have upon an organization the author poses simple objective and easily managed data collection methodology that illuminates the worth to an organization
seven risk categories are defined with guidelines for data collection being confined to only what is told directly to the om buds by visitor upon initial intake
standards of confidentiality and impartiality and availability of objective data are discussed in relation to the cate go ries
an example of risk categories data report is provided with an evaluation of limitations of this methodology
ombudsman worth visibility usefulness effectiveness confidentiality
the author wishes to thank randy dar on maureen brodie and ellen gold stein for their support and suggestions and willingness to expand data collection to new area
in addition the author is grateful to mary ro we for her validation of the concepts of the article for her initial review of this document and her generous nature of reaching out to newcomers to the om buds field
the author also wishes to thank laurie for her detailed review of the article and insightful discussion of the methodology
katherine bi ala tempt to articulate the benefits to an organization that may be hearing for the first time about om buds work
clearly the continued search for ways to demonstrate convincing data by an objective methodology is justified
sometimes simple perspective can provide valid conceptualization
simple objective methodology om buds practice spans broad range of assistance to stake holders
one important role is to assist in making positive connections between and among those in conflict
starting point to substantiating om buds worth is defining what conflict is but even at this starting point what kind of conflict should be measured may be unclear buss
for example considering positive versus negative conflicts or individually manifested conflicts that belie more systemic root causes such that the term denotes lies in the eyes of the
the next challenging step is then to define the value of om buds conflict management work and place some measurement to this
one of the more comprehensive articles that summarizes current challenges as well as listing ways the profession has sought to capture of om buds worth is by mary ro we in usefulness of the organizational ro we
many current articles support some form of on and translating conflict prevention into monetary value dana buss
yet no one way seems to satisfy majority of om buds needs possibly because of reluctance to categorize om buds practice with some financial strategy the cumbersomeness and complexity of systems that would require more documentation and research from om buds staff and possibly losing the anecdotal visitor voice the value most important to many practicing om buds in such calculations
in being privy to the breadth of cases particularly of the numerous serious cases that regularly present themselves to om buds offices the author was concerned with the notion of being more visible to organizational stake holders for the obvious significance of work
in integrating awareness of of global human capital report barn es and measurement strategies ro we et al
buss and identifying the most serious cases seen in an om buds office typology with seven is presented
the list is based upon the most regularly occurring significant identifiable issues that pose highest risk to both visitors and the organization
the decision whether to count case in particular category is limited to only what has been directly communicated to om buds by visitors ie not whether the visitor actually followed through with reported intent and not whether the om buds deemed the statement as credible and not whether the om buds interventions changed the outcome of the intent threat or progression of the issue
the data collection would only account for the initial statement of the presenting problem at face value
this would confine the data to somewhat more data base of information
katherine bi ala the seven categories of risk are as follows category loss of departmental productivity due to pervasive conflict conflict involving more than two persons category unwarranted staff attrition transfer category negative publicity category significant violations of policy code of conduct category potential of internal or external grievance reporting processes category litigation potential category high risk safety issue violence physical harm the following are examples of visitor words that qualify for placement in one of the categories category number of us have really serious issues with our
category get this resolved quitting my
category going to the newspaper if this
category know that fraud is going on in my
am post doc student having an affair with my faculty
category am thinking of filing grievance for
category feel that should get an attorney just to protect my
category been known to have bad temper and aware he owns
tried to let my supervisor know that the issue have concerns about could become physical safety issue for the employees we
katherine bi alain the experience of one om buds office the majority of cases brought to the om buds office did not fall into any of these risk categories
however when risk categories do apply single case may also be counted in multiple categories eg visitor claiming serious violation of code of conduct may also be contemplating legal counsel and therefore is counted into category and
risk categories are readily comprehended by those reviewing the data report
the data collection is quite simple and the seven categories can be added to an intake form
each om buds completing the initial intake form will record the relevant category or categories in check box format for ease of documenting
quarterly or annual collation of data can be generated depending upon the total volume of cases served
objectivity confidentiality and impartiality as matter of om buds practice all om buds are intuitively assessing levels of risk in case at the beginning and throughout the course of the case
the risk categories data collection attempts to concretize this risk assessment and maintain objectivity confidentiality and impartiality risk categories are objective because what is counted is only what the visitors have directly communicated to the om buds about their own perspectives on their current situations and their own possible future behaviors actions
judgments however are not made as to any potential case outcomes or of the veracity of the visitor statements
subjectivity is reduced by relying completely upon the visitor communication such that even in cases in which there may appear to be clear and legitimate breech of policy if the visitor does not state that he she intends to file grievance this case will not be counted into high risk category
risk categories are confidential in that even with the most sensitive cases risk categories do not reveal any details of case yet the data can clearly communicate worth to the organization
although describing one or more significant cases may be compelling method of calling attention to the value of the om buds office the data may run the risk of being identifiable through details described
risk categories are impartial in that both visitor and senior officers will not see this data as supporting one constituency over the other
if om buds were to translate this data to dollars saved for the organization visitor may feel that his her suffering and resolution of the problem should not be calculated as money saved for the organization
the data itself gives recognition to the most serious concerns of the visitors
the organization receives objective validation that some of their most important concerns are being forwarded to an appropriate resource chosen by the visitor ie the om buds office
katherine interests whoever they may be in given organization and however they might be affected by the perceptions of the visitors who presented these issues
below is an example of four month year to date graph of the number of cases in each risk category of cases sample of risk categories data report this type of data appears to provide some insight for stake holders into the worth of the om buds office despite not answering the question of outcomes of such cases
often organizational stake holders are not so interested in the same details of validation that om buds value they are less interested in descriptions of our services types of om buds interventions or scope of practice as they are interested in of information related to their perspective
although this type of graph stimulates more case questions it serves as valuable initial information platform from which stakeholder can pursue further research
the risk categories developed for one organization does not limit the possibilities for other organizations with different stake holders
what is important is that the compilation of the categories emanates directly from the type of issues brought forth by the visitors that can vary from organization to organization
it is the om buds staff that determines the categories based on their knowledge of the most frequently occurring and not from predetermined list of categories proposed by any organizational stakeholder
there is however some measure of judgment by the om buds in formulating risk categories of the
such elements as severity of the emotional tenor stakes verbalized by the visitor the reach to other persons affected by the issue or other such criteria of visitor experience must also be factored in
based upon the population of visitors coming to given om buds office the risk categories may indeed be quite different because the most serious issues of the visitors could vary
points regarding limitations to this methodology may be as follows some visitors may say they will their or will an but do not follow through for number of reasons and this data does not tell us whether the om buds prevented for example the potential litigation or staff attrition or grievance filing
to the first concern it is likely that staff attrition intentions or considerations of maintaining legal counsel for example may be communicated by some visitors in cavalier manner but it is not usually said of insignificant issues
consideration should be given to any such verbalizations as measure of some level of severity and be taken with degree of seriousness
although not every person who states to the om buds that they intend to maintain legal counsel will do so there may be others who do not visit the om buds office who will in fact pursue litigation
however of those who communicate this intent to the om buds the chances are more likely that this is the group from which there is the highest probability that follow through will occur
additionally some visitors may communicate that they will file grievance or seek legal counsel to purposely amplify the seriousness of the presenting issue without having any real intention of their doing so this also will be counted in risk categories
in order to be consistent with assigning risk categories based on only statements made by the visitors lack of visitor intent to follow through or misleading visitor statements are not factors in assignment to risk category
this represents key limitation of the risk categories being confined to statements made by visitors without the benefit of later exploration of issues that will occur over the course of work with the om buds
counting risk categories at the conclusion of the case may avert such limitations but will also create other limitations and challenges
katherine bi ala as to the second limitation that the risk category data does not substantiate the effectiveness of the om buds to curtail resolve prevent or mitigate the outcomes of these serious issues this is absolutely true
this data collection methodology was designed to indirectly communicate the worth of the om buds office to balance the of our work due to the highly confidential and impartial nature of our practice
visibility does not speak necessarily to effectiveness of om buds practice continues to be highly elusive to quantify
visibility via tracking risk categories communicates that stake holders know about om buds services and see the om buds as potential resource to assist them with their most serious issues as an important measure of
in addition om buds may not always know the ultimate outcome as to whether someone eventually left his her job pursued legal alternatives experienced real harm or filed report of significant violation etc
if effectiveness were to be quantified data collection must necessarily extend to other departments such as human resources legal counsel risk management administration compliance officer etc
this has obvious challenges in and of itself
risk categories confine the data to very specific information exclusively obtained through the om buds office that involves no other data source but our own
the limitations of the risk categories reinforces that this data should not supplant other methods to identify trend and report the work of the om buds and supports the ongoing need to create and refine tools that will exemplify our worth to organizations

keen abstract resolution of serious conflicts within organizations often leaves actors in stressed state facing residual issues that remain unaddressed
parties and departments involved in such post conflict situations can benefit from support in addressing relational structural process and fairness issues to rebuild productive and supportive working environment
the authors provide insights in organizational post conflict rebuilding drawn from their own experience as well as from literature in the conflict resolution and om buds fields
om buds organizational conflict dispute resolution leadership peace building post conflict
keen departmental tension the of the involved parties to build alliances the stress of covering the work of someone who may have been temporarily removed from responsibilities and perhaps most significantly the role these employees are asked to play in providing interviews testimony or documents in the context of the formal investigation
particularly when conflicts become public battles played out in the media or in the organizational grapevine there is loss of privacy and often loss of for the parties and for the organization
even when the conflict is resolved through informal channels some of these tensions and dynamics are in play though the resolution is likely to involve far more empowerment and perhaps facesaving for the parties
the focus in this paper is what happens to the individuals and the department units involved the fire is
what are employees in coming together as highly functioning unit and in being able to create or recreate an environment in which they can enjoy working and which is acceptably just civil and respectful
and equally important what is the impact of the conflict and of its management on the broader university organizational system
writing about the relationship of the creation of appropriate conflict management systems in university context ombudsperson dr
marsha wagner of columbia university writes for students and certainly for employees the university is workplace
all the members of this organization are part of community of people with shared history whose transcripts and resumes careers and life history will always bear the mark of this association
thus they all have stake in how the university manages its conflicts and what image it projects both internally and
as ombudsmen we are responsible to these organizational publics to the organization as whole and sometimes to broader public communities to help manage conflict in way that creates positive change both for individuals and the institution
it is sometimes more difficult to find ways to work at the organizational system level
number of people in our field are thinking and writing about ways the om bud man can contribute to system change lynch stu rm and gad lin wagner and nea le and we are interested in looking at possibilities for greater follow through in the aftermath of departmental conflict
our work in conflict resolution has taught us that when parties have been involved in lengthy legal personal or departmental conflicts before seeking mediation or other collaborative process they often come in weary depressed hopeless entrenched and very much in need of some support just to be able to engage
while people in our organizational departments are often very professional and manage to keep up some degree of as they also demonstrate some of these characteristics
in the words of one member of such department feels like working in
so when determination of outcome is made the mines may still be on the and expectations that one just over it and goes handicaps departments in the kind of thoughtful analysis and reconstruction that may be needed
we know from broader conflict studies that there actually is no real since conflict rises and falls with some regularity and sometimes with good and important outcomes
we might better describe it as going through phases
in organizational contexts there is recurrent phase when the official process has been concluded and our departments are left with number of problems
some of these problems developed during the active flow of the conflict
others were problems that probably initially contributed to the conflict maybe were even primary contributors but have remained unrecognized andor unaddressed in the resolution of the conflict as it was framed
to illustrate some of these we have borrowed examples from the experiences of colleagues and from our own experience in university and organizational conflict
research from number of disciplines indicates that when people are experiencing stress the quality of their communication and conflict management skills can decline significantly
in international settings researchers are finding that attention to personal stress and trauma is necessary before people are capable of engaging in structural rebuilding and peace building efforts wit te and tau ber
in organizational contexts people who are under stress are likely to restrict or distort new information and pay less attention to important environmental cues that would help them interpret staw sand elands and
fol ger po ole and stut man believe that at this point people are also more likely to engage in what rhetorical and social theorist kenneth burke refers to as patterns of perception and communication that they have learned to use and which have worked for them in the past and that while they provide some insight for the person also create blindness
for example people who had developed positive patterns of conflict engagement may allow themselves to slip back into old patterns of passive aggressive behavior
or people whose expertise and habit is to speak the language of and quarterly may repress departmental discussion of sustainable growth and quality
so an important impact of unaddressed post conflict stress is that just at the time when the organization needs employees to surface the best communication skills they have they may be unable to do so
in traditional international relations and earlier international conflict resolution studies is about entrenched ethnic group conflict that centers on getting adequate resources to meet many kinds of interests for that group
but in the context of interpersonal and organizational conflict identity is more personal view of self and claim for certain amount of human dignity and worth
identity can come from many things certainly including perceptions of respect from peers status and role in the department and interpersonal connections
often in conflict perception of he will at the end of it all is more important than he will
in that respect loss of face or identity can be the greatest loss people experience in conflict as the examples below from employees worked with treated like pariah because said what everyone here thought
the rest of my life you can go ogle my name and find that was accused of sexual harassment
my close friends know better but even my colleagues here sure about
people also tend to hold on to those resources that support their identities corner office title parking space so being asked to redistribute any of the office may feel especially threatening
and while people struggle to hold their own persona in place they also try to force an identity for the other
this process can be very polarizing and destructive since each party loses credibility with the other paints for themselves picture of an impossible conflict partner and limits opportunities for productive work
intervention to call into question and encourage broadened identities is required and participants can be empowered in this way to negotiate more effectively and collaboratively
international peace builder and researcher lisa sc hir ch argues that identities of self and other can be transformed and that ritual defined as specifically designed social activities with specific interaction and performance parameters can help participants enlarge or change their perceptions of their own identity or that of perceived adversary in the conflict context
employees often speak of their sense of loss of trust of sense of agency and of fun and camaraderie within the department and they may be reconsidering the of this workplace for them
the quotes below reflect in this office is lost all said one employee do anything to contribute to
all been walking on eggshells for so long forgotten what like to enjoy coming to
in the post conflict phase issues present in the original conflict phase often remain unaddressed or ineffectively addressed
in work and peace in academe leveraging time money and intellectual energy through managing conflict kansas state provost james coff man posits that the category of employee most crucial to positive conflict management in universities are department chairs and heads
while nonacademic organizations clearly have some difference in governance styles and responsibilities our own experience is that department heads and supervisor positions are generally the most crucial positions in most kinds of organizations
most of the items discussed below highlight problems exhibited by department heads and managers in post conflict context
lack of communication skills in leaders
particularly if formal process returns judgment that the evidence conclusive enough to support the complaint filed people in leadership positions may name or the conflict personality or
these are shallow conflict frames that often serve the purpose of protecting the status quo
when person in leadership position chooses to frame the conflict in such shallow manner she may be deflecting the locus of the problem back onto the employee as well as denying the other experience
in another example supervisor tells subordinate who has filed grievance was totally supportive of you
the supervisor in this instance have the ability to see that while that and may have been his intent those words reflect the experience
keen lack of supervision and resp on sib il it
in organizational settings administrators are very busy being responsible to multiple groups
while their internal department supervisors and managers may need mentor ing and support from the administrator for their relationships with employees the administrator is often engaged with outside professional associations with keeping up with new external requirements with fundraising or with her own professional contributions to her field
we have worked with situations like this many times and our own experiences mirror an example given by stu rm and gad lin
investigation of leave request problem between an employee and manager at revealed pattern of discretionary decisions and lack of accountability by the manager with little or no supervision of the manager by the supervising scientist whose attention went to his own research
employees chose not to report the problem since their experience was that the supervisor would turn it over to the manager whom the employees believed was likely to retaliate
as ombudsmen important to find ways to identify this lack of supervisory accountability as problem if it is occurring and to find ways to support positive system change through individual case work coaching training peer problem analysis or through annual reports making broader systemic recommendations
this kind of abdication of responsibility for the working of the department will continue to lead to employees seeking outside help and often to formal rights based solutions which though they are important and valuable options often increase the tension without always solving the problems
occasional administrator preference for formal or rights based solutions
an occurrence we have seen recently is seeming preference by very few organizational administrators for the early use of grievance procedures or other rights based solutions
when an employee believes something is happening that is contrary to policy or governing document or is creating hostile workplace environment they may be told either subtly or directly what grievances are
from the point of view and sometimes from that of conflict party such an action saves time in having to listen to multiple viewpoints or speculate about various interpretations and it gets judgment that cleanly adjudicates the issue ending time and energy spent on the problem
while this response may be appropriate in some situations if it is regular practice among organizational leadership it may contribute to the creation of culture of polarization rather than culture of problem solving for effective work processes and environment
keen ti on system in nonunion environment writes that while the system must provide strong rights based as well as interest based options the conflict culture must see it as major responsibility of line managers and team members supported by senior managers prevent unnecessary problems through active listening and effective respectful as well as supporting questions and
inadequate structures processes in place to ensure critical anal ys is and engaged conversations about actionable issues
formal andor rights based processes for issues such as sexual harassment and gender discrimination equity hostile work environment and racial harassment or discrimination are tremendous advantages in that they provide protection of important principles provided in law and in organizational policy
but such processes can also be detrimental if leaders interpret an investigative report finding inadequate evidence of particular charge to mean is no problem
leaders who are able to engage in more serious analysis will understand that cultural dynamics related to these issues may be creating serious tensions that still need to be addressed
koch man and ma vr el is in reporting the results of research on diversity issues in the us corporate world describe number of areas of difference and tension that are not commonly understood but that clearly influence expectations
these expectations include approach to and feelings of safety in the workplace ideas about development of trust ideas about what is and ideas about who is included in generalization about another race ethnicity or culture
so according to koch man and ma vr el is in diverse workplace race and ethnicity and cultural factors are always in play because cognitive social and cultural frameworks are in confrontation
but as stu rm and gad lin report when race is determined not to be the primary cause of the conflict problem then race out of the analysis even if racial dynamics are an important but not determinative element of the problem
the dynamics of cognitive bias and cultural exclusion may not be visible at the level of the individual case and many people do not understand race in these
in one organization we are aware of caucasian supervisor parallel coworker and an additional coworker with whom the employee interacted regularly all were african american
the caucasian employee identified restrictions that impacted the ability to manage heavy load of customer service as unevenly applied and possibly racially motivated
post conflict work with the participants addressed issues of problematic management practices and restrictions as experienced by both the parallel employees
evaluated to great extent by client complaints on whether got back to them on time and on whether gave them good advice
but we have larger client loads here than other institutions have and not even allowed to manage our own time in ways that would let us get to everyone
plus the supervisor makes exceptions to policies that we work from all the time and it makes people at our level look like we know what
is paying attention to what we are saying
always on fast pace meeting deadlines with no time to think no time to strategize about processes and systems that would help us manage the load more efficiently no time to get new training
lessons from international post conflict analysis and peace building in addressing the kinds of considerations that might be helpful in phase within department or organization we have found it helpful to draw parallels from international research and practice
peace building researcher and activist john paul lede rach writes about the need for crossover of approaches in the post cold war era between the fields of international relations with its focus on monitoring and keeping of agreements and rebuilding of infrastructure and international conflict resolution which has focused on addressing interpersonal and system issues through dialogue and relationship building
more recent study also traces the recent development of the concept of post conflict peace building from its early focus on attention to institutional reform human rights monitoring and social and economic to more recent emphasis on that adds such concerns as grass roots involvement reconciliation building cultures of respect for human rights and respectful conflict engagement
as it strives for sustainable change
lede rach believes conflict should be envisioned as opportunities for creating constructive change processes and that sustainable peace building must focus on relationships even in the context of structural rebuilding that people must acknowledge the past and envision the future and that it is within the interaction of those affected by the conflict that we find the methods and language needed for particular situation
keen lede rach argues that sustainable peace building requires reconciliation both of people and of concepts and that reconciliation is built on or the linking of two seemingly dualistic concepts which can actually be interdependent
this dynamic is illustrated in story of peace building in nicaragua
lede rach accompanied local peace coalition leaders in escorting home the yati ma leaders who had been exiled by the sand in ist as
in each village the conciliation leaders would read and mercy have met together peace and justice have
because these terms were clearly meaningful to the villagers as paradoxical but reconcilable lede rach asked for more clarity on how they saw each of the terms lede rach
was seen as honesty revelation accountability and vulnerability
reflected acceptance forgiveness and new start
but mercy can function in opposition to and according to the villagers interviewed when it and too
was seen as being about correcting wrongs creating equal opportunity and restitution
and finally was about wellbeing harmony and prevalent feelings of respect and security for all the and sustainable peace needs to work together with concepts of justice which sometimes have seemingly opposite focus
from this perspective only when there is some reconciliation of these interdependent goals and concepts can there be true reconciliation of communities of people
lede rach believes reconciliation requires the creation of an encounter where these paradoxes can be explored and joined together rather than being forced into an encounter in which one must win out over the other or envisioned as fragmented and separated parts lede rach
for example in speaking about racial and ethnic conflict on university campuses gad lin stated that policies organized around disciplinary and punitive sanctions allow us to locate social ugliness in the deficiencies and pathologies of the other
they allow us to ignore the larger problems associated with moving toward truly multicultural gad lin
so according to gad lin the very things we create to do good may actually also do harm
policies designed for accountability and justice may preclude the possibility of honesty revelation and acceptance of responsibility
paradoxes can be reconciled but we need to find the way to the encounter of which lede rach speaks that opens pathway of dialogue and authentic exploration of needs and possibilities
historian and social commentator timothy gar ton ash writing in the context of the wake of wars and revolutionary changes such as the end of communism in eastern europe also considers the kind of encounter that supports real peace building
in describing the gamut nations often run from retribution to large scale attempts at forgetting ash finds fault with both the retributive approach which visits too much retribution on too few and with the forgetting approach which often drives real concerns underground where they may fester and resurface in fresh conflict phases
while ash is less prescriptive than lede rach and offers no silver bullet he suggests that measured approach that is honest about the need to move forward without burying the past and that is appropriate to the particular situation has born the greatest fruit in these situations in the past and holds the most promise of building toward the future ash pp
for organizational departments applications from this body of work to our own work as ombudsmen include the ideas that post conflict rebuilding requires commitment to sustainable change and focused attention on improving departmental structures and processes so that they work effectively for all involved respect for rights even when no rights based process has been invoked time and skills to work at real reconciliation of ideas and workplace communities and attention to the building of departmental cultures of respect for difference and of support for constructive conflict engagement
perhaps most relevant to the work is the possible need for involvement of all departmental community members in recovery process that avoids scapegoating but acknowledges that difficult episode has concluded its official administrative phase and has produced its adjudicated results and now the department must take responsibility for creating an appropriate way to move forward
the more explicitly organizational or departmental leadership facilitates such process and the more seriously individual department members take responsibility for their own willingness to engage in the process the better the results will be
former colleague used this expression to describe the kinds of processes many of us use to encourage organizations to address the deeper problem underlying the initial request for intervention or training
the colleague would consider an invitation to mediate or to these people in conflict but she would ask first for conversation with broad spectrum of key people in the organization
as she led the participants in surfacing the deeper issues that created the need for the mediation or training she would often come away with the invitation to work with them more fruitfully in identifying and addressing broader system issues diversity issues equity issues etc
there may be times when we need to dive deeper in our role as ombudsmen
the points below are things that we believe need to happen for department following the kind of constructive conflict we have discussed
the services may come from somewhere other than the office of the ombudsman but they may need some kind of support or organization from the ombudsman and they seem to be particularly appropriate for the skills of an ombudsman depending on whether we can provide these services with independence with confidentiality and in general within our standards of practice
an important place to start with post conflict department rebuilding is to offer department heads and managers process and set of skills for critical analysis and reflection about the experience
many people in leadership positions are not trained in at the of their experience or of the language of the conflict
keen contributing factors that lead to this conflict or consider the presence of the types of racial gender equity and other tensions that may be still be
so here is an important place where the ombudsman can help people consider the conflict in ways that allows for and calls for remediation that ensures that fairness and are being protected and that increases commitment to and creates path to improving structures and processes
the where the paradoxes can be considered and perhaps reconciled and we need to build capacity for this kind of work
cummin gs and keen offer an approach to coaching in which they train groups of leaders in critical thinking and reflection and then pair leaders at approximately the same level to process their immediate leadership challenges and how they see their options for action
applied to analysis and reflection of departmental conflicts the ombudsman can become conversational partner to support the department head or supervisor in critical reflection and analysis
perhaps better for the system however would be to offer education and coaching for an ongoing program of peer support as described by cummin gs and keen
stu rm and gad lin describe process created by the office of the ombudsman at the national institutes of health in which department heads were invited to meet as group taking cases from one of their departments to analyze looking for root cause and at the processes and steps along the way that led to the problem
the process at involved careful training and coaching of the participants to do effective analysis creating pattern for remediating those issues and for better handling of future situations
our experience is that in the absence of the kind of training and support described above the search for the may sometimes be hasty process that comes up with the easiest possible fix burying significant underlying causes and producing problems at the next opportunity
there must be considered approach where the goal is to get multiple aspects of the problem into clear view through some kind of problem mapping designed to gain grasp of the complexity inherent in the problem and to pinpoint the key relationships in either untangling or adapting to that complexity
additionally while the identification of causes or contributing factors usually can lead to productive change that identification always result in eradication of the problem without compromising central positive values and practices
healthy post conflict environment may therefore require naming inherent tensions and becoming explicit about ways of learning to live productively within the stresses they cause
in different one on one approach to developing self awareness of responsibility in conflict ombudsmen tom and lisa nea le have created series of questions for supervisors who want to refer employees to the office for mediation
keen finally employees in both leadership and non leadership positions need support to create departmental culture where difference is valued and constructive conflict engagement is practiced
while there are many dimensions to such culture there are also some very specific steps that can be taken to begin or further the process including ensuring respectful and systematic process to receive and address concerns and recommendations
employees in both leadership and non leadership roles would benefit from training and coaching to frame issues they are concerned about in more authentic effective and addressable ways
in such culture supervisors and line managers would also be helped to develop skills in coaching their own reports in constructive conflict engagement and would have access themselves to continued coaching support to develop more agile set of responses to conflicts as they arise
this paper was conceptualized to explore the problem of residual effects of formalized or extended conflict processes and the frequent failure of those processes to actually solve the problems that brought about the conflict
ombudsman can appropriately assist in providing or finding support to department leaders to increase skills for rebuilding sense of unity and to create sustainable change in the post conflict phase as well in development of departmental cultures that respect rights and encourage respectful conflict engagement
of primary importance is the need for creation and facilitation of processes for reflection and analysis both for department supervisors and for the departmental community

psycho trauma and nonviolent conflict resolution at ka to wice poland september
martin freres abstract conflict resolution in the workplace is claimed to save organizations money yet quantification of costs are rare
necessarily incomplete but systematic review of the scholarly literature and web sites identifies medical health individual psyche team behavior wasted time legal and dispute costs customer relationships hr od and counterproductive work behavior as the major paths through which workplace conflict costs organizations money
workplace conflict appears to waste approximately hours per week per employee be directly related to costly turnover and result in virtually avoidable legal fees
the author would like to thank lex and er in sam for inspiring him to write this article helm ut buss david talbot and nd rew lar rat ts mi th for encouraging the submission and three anonymous reviewers for their very helpful comments

wasted employee time due to workplace conflict is estimated at hours per week
wasted managerial time due to workplace conflict is estimated between and of their week or to hours assuming hour work week
wasted hr staff time due to workplace conflict is estimated between and hours per week
the word may be less applicable to hr staff as some hr departments have the responsibility of resolving conflict
while the estimates for employee time and hr staff time rely on multiple and recent sources the estimates of managerial time spent on conflict come generally only from two old sources thomas sch mi dt watson ho ff man and from one recent but very small nonrepresentative sample
moreover watson and article is not directly concerned with measuring the time managers spend on resolving conflict but only mentions that their participants were managers that according to self reports spent up to of their work time informally negotiating
hence the estimates of the time that managers spend on conflict should not be accepted as reliable
the estimates for general staff and hr staff however appear reliable
one study suggests that employees become less productive if involved in work place conflict harris
however this study suggests this number rather as an example for model calculation and does not provide any evidence for this estimate
upon additional search another estimate on lost productivity of due to workplace conflict was found barn es
however this estimate was also not backed by data or description of method
therefore these estimates cannot be accepted as reliable
turnover costs are estimated to be between and of the annual salary of the position needing replacement depending on seniority and skill of the position
this is due to the many costs that leaving employee causes such as immediate loss of productivity due to the vacancy recruitment selection and training costs for the new hire
mu rt ha suggests that of turnover is at least related to if not directly caused by work place conflict
mu rt ha however does not provide any data or method for this estimation
dux bury and find that half of all voluntary turnover is related to frustration with the work place
martin freres between workplace conflict and frustration is obvious the strength of this link was not estimated
overall it appears that even conservative estimates for turnover costs should be sufficient cause for organizations to attempt to reduce turnover
more reliable analysis of conflict costs through turnover is however urgently needed
the studies reviewed in this report are mostly concerned with employment disputes in the
they find that formal employment disputes are extraordinarily time consuming each case taking up more than days in hr management and in house lawyer time
moreover cases are extraordinarily expensive when they go in front of tribunal ie labor court costing typically more than per case
less than tenth of this money is spent if an early resolution for example through mediation is reached
establishing the specific costs of formal dispute resolution to any organization should be relatively easy task because attorney and court fees as well as compensation payments are directly available
an organizationally specific analysis has the additional benefit of taking into account the specific legal framework in which the organization is situated
more litigious societies for example tend to find much higher legal costs than less litigious societies
the costs of work place conflict to the organization can be identified and are hard but not impossible to quantify
this review identified eight themes medical health individual psyche team behavior wasted time legal and dispute costs customer relationship human resources organizational development and counterproductive work behavior that explain how work place conflict costs the organization money
moreover for wasted time turnover and legal and dispute activities costs can be estimated on average every employee wastes hours week on conflict
this time can be multiplied with the hourly salary to show direct costs
up to half of all voluntary turnover may be directly related to frustration at work traceable to workplace conflict
each time an employee resigns anything between of this annual salary will be spent due to the departure
finally legal and other fees may well exceed over per employment dispute
some studies suggest that this cost can be reduced by up to
at the same time the proposed eight themes and the quantification for three of them should be taken with grain of salt because number of the reviewed studies did not provide any information on the methods and the overall sample of studies is very diverse
furthermore the reviewed studies were not sorted or selected according to the definition of workplace conflict that they applied
this paper and its overall results therefore also lack clear underlying definition of workplace conflict
martin freres given that three kinds of costs can be reliably quantified in at least some studies the next step could be the development of reliable cost analysis tool that can be applied to single organization to provide it with an estimate of their conflict costs
time spent on workplace conflict could be measured through self reports because they are easy to obtain and the respondent can either already distinguish between functional and dysfunctional as carefully defined by the researcher cp
in sam or the survey may not even ask to make that distinction because what the respondent intuitively understands as conflict appears to have not any beneficial effects on the organization at all cp
measuring turnover due to work place conflict needs to likewise rely on employee self reports as it is the intention of the employee that counts
surveys and exit interviews for employees leaving the organization should be useful
measuring legal and other formal dispute resolution costs should be conducted through collecting the respective accounting information and quickly yield very reliable data
if reliable analysis tool can be used in practice it may help to communicate the importance of conflict resolution systems to organizations and their board of directors
first very promising attempt at such tool although using estimates of managers rather than direct measurement of conflict costs is the by oliver ah re ns see
finally we have to consider that financial impact can only be one among many factors to assess the success of conflict resolution systems cp
also taxonomy of financial costs of conflict should not be taken to mean that conflicts themselves can be easily pigeonholed into categories
we should remember that conflicts are often ill defined and deeply embedded into the social fabric which itself is complex and hard to predict cp
therefore taxonomy of quantitative conflict costs should instead serve to gain the attention of those governing the money to finance the in depth qualitative investigation and resolution of organizational conflicts

the ombudsman endeavors to be worthy of the trust placed in the ombudsman office
om buds program integration contribution value andrea sch en ck and john
to be valuable positioning om buds programs
without the probing questions heated debates and passion for continuous improvement in the field this article would not have been possible
those programs and their leadership who made the commitment not only for third party to examine the value of their programs but to introduce the results shell ic ann hal li burton and the world bank also had an important role
early thinking for this article emerged from long ago exchange between john and mary ro we
many others clients colleagues respected om buds programs that closed students from negotiation and conflict resolution om buds classes as well as those organizations who have said they do not need an om buds program have all directly or indirectly helped cultivate nurture and prune the concepts presented
the authors take full responsibility for any errors or omissions

for her mighty red pen the authors salute rachel hutch is son
and while moments did occur when the feeling might have been less than gratitude genuinely the authors are most grateful to david miller for his interest and support in promoting the ideal of om buds program value
every major organization to have an organizational ombudsman is the guiding principle of the international ombudsman newly announced february strategic plan
this vast goal one which the authors fully endorse becomes reality only when the field changes how it both envisions and values itself
similar to the typical case brought to an om buds this article is about two or three interrelated issues
and like the typical case what matters is that the process generates sound options and choices which when chosen and enacted lead to better future
this purpose is to stimulate discussion advance new actions and consolidate lexicon for the broadly defined arena of organizational om buds program value
it outlines how program can responsibly position itself so both the program and its organization recognize the contributions as
authors propose that the om buds program which is aligned embedded and integrated within its organization increases potential including management program awareness understanding and therefore trust resulting in higher usage and therefore value
this is not pursuit of equations aimed at quickly measuring program cost effectiveness or return on investment roi
with attention to particular design and processes each is possible without violating or diminishing independence or confidentiality
value addition requires foundational approach to enable the responsible execution of data collection activities and equations
for this the authors promote an expanded paradigm one that extends from the typical and primarily om buds centric individual level perspective to more programmatic effort which generates systems level perspective
next designing activities for alignment embedment and integration an om buds program with its organization will maximize both om buds and program contributions
the informed contributions are prerequisites to adequately determine the full humanistic economic and organizational value created by om buds programs
the authors assert that when om buds and their organizations engage this new mind set and corresponding activities they will cease to miss opportunities to create value ensure program sustain ability increase the professionalization of om buds ing and speed the growth of the field
two longstanding questions drive the encouragement for this change
the first why do such small percentage of potential program users less than percent in most reported examples and as low as percent especially in large organizations seek assistance from om buds programs
given the considerable research based evidence of growth in work place dissatisfaction harassment discrimination wrongdoing and more it seems many more employees would want journal of the international ombudsman association andrea sch en ck and john
certainly there could be instances of low program usage as consequence of an om buds not being good fit for the organization or an lack of connection rapport or trust with the members of the organization due to some other inadequacy
for example program could be designed improperly with the om buds assigned collateral duty or the position established merely as
the second what inhibits the ubiquity of organizational om buds programs especially in the corporate setting
given the ever present and costly work place challenges why are there not more om buds programs coming online to address the dominant negative organizational climate
the intersection of these questions points to the reality organizational om buds programs are still not well understood either for what they offer individuals or organizations
this appears as true as it did years ago when considered by marsha wagner
consequently few leaders people committed to advancing their organizations from point to point decide to implement om buds programs
since few programs have documented usage rates that exceed four percent of the potential user population and even fewer programs measure and publicly declare their contributions and full value how could leaders know appreciate or be motivated to initiate om buds programs
this key concepts have not been widely used in the field
to advance meaningful discussion requires shared understanding
when an om buds activities and the outcome of these activities intentionally connect with and support the host mission goal and objectives alignment exists

careful not to confuse the association with the field this interest in or to others has not always been universally supported
while several voices notably ro we and mun zen rider prompted the field to measure activities to create meaningful dec la rations of or these encouragements often lead to more deliberation than activity
harrison presented concise statement of this debate
the focus on an om buds helping an individual program user dominated the beginnings of the contemporary organizational om buds field
many early om buds practitioners became om buds by way of social work teaching or similar fields with focus on one to one communications
the host organization and especially its leadership while recognized at times as stake holders were also considered as potentially destabilizing influences on abilities to uphold the four defining characteristics
this one to one emphasis and the one person om buds office led to the synonymous use of om buds and om buds program
though often used interchangeably they do not mean the same
the responsibilities of the practitioner and the program differ
to ignore the distinction limits the effectiveness and potential of each
journal of the international ombudsman association andrea sch en ck and john
the and advancements in systems became more common
the practice of holding departments accountable for their costs and returns increased extending even to om buds programs
as programs with well regarded om buds such as co ors and pace university closed the question of value drew greater notice
the lens however remained largely fixed on what an om buds was doing vis vis his or her assistance to those contacting the office while excluding or neglecting how the program aligned and contributed to the organization
harrison described this perspective when he wrote the exception of convenience sample om buds research has not reported how disputants evaluate an om buds choosing instead to focus from the om buds perspective emphasis on how om buds
despite the synonymous usage of om buds and program the essential point is that the perspective meaning the organization as an entity unto itself and not represented by any subset of stake holders is absent
this absence of the programmatic and organizational perspectives remains the challenge today
the debate about the appropriateness of measuring and sharing data on om buds contributions continued
voices such as buss fowl ie miller and began calling for increased efforts on program evaluation which could make clear claims on value addition
yet only very few organizations have assessed their contributions to estimate value especially with an actual monetary figure
even fewer have made such information public
hal li burton ic ann shell and the world bank are notable exceptions which have had external parties assay their om buds programs and present the findings to the field
there appears to be continuing interest in the process and models to make legitimate claims of value addition
it is the hope this article will lead om buds and their programs as ro we put it to short term and long term tangible and intangible contributions in ways that are relevant to their own
it appears likely that the absence of programmatic contributes to low program usage rates limited knowledge on the part of leaders and others about their om buds contributions and value and fewer programs
according to the petr om survey of organizational om buds practices an informal sample conducted during the annual conference it seems that individual practice remain focused on how to an nt and often ni que re sol uti on to each parti cul ar situation
while neglecting the at least equally important programmatic focus by which an om buds program can contribute to its organization
the survey responses suggested some still do not recognize the value of an organizationally aligned and interconnected program
for example when asked to rate the quality of executive support of the om buds office respondents indicated that the executive board percent or financial officers percent and other percent support was not only not present but actually not applicable
when asked to rate different attitudes about their program respondents stated that such related functions as compliance percent hr percent and legal percent were also not applicable
these responses hint that some om buds practitioners see themselves as not just but organizationally disconnected

case to expect more cases in her ted talk dare to disagree margaret he ff ern an notes that percent of american and european managers are afraid of what conflict provokes afraid to get into arguments they are unsure how to manage or believe they would lose
countless issues and concerns go unraised costing organizations un quantifiable expense in missed deadlines failed projects ill equipped personnel or faulty products at best and massive lawsuits damaged reputations or bankrupt businesses at worst
to illustrate imagine hypothetical person organization with management tier of
this percent equates to managers who could be high quality potential users of an om buds program
if only half accessed the om buds program the usage rate percent would more than double the widely normal rate
the ethics research center national business ethics survey noted percent of those surveyed observed misconduct in the work place
in of those who observed misconduct percent answered they did not report what they saw
of the percent who did report misconduct more than one in five workers said they experienced retaliation
what does this suggest for om buds programs
returning to the hypothetical organization the percent who observed misconduct equals people
of these or percent did not report the observed misconduct
sub group of these non reporters is especially startling nearly percent of non reporters people in the people company wanted to report but did not know where to go in the organization
regardless of the reason for not reporting the math results in percent of the organization as having had reason to access the om buds regarding the issue of misconduct alone
furthermore of those who observed misconduct percent reported it and of that group percent or people were retaliated against
this is another pool of high potential om buds users in the organization
as these two groups are not exclusive combining these groups means individuals had solid motivations to access the om buds
that equals percent of the organization
if even half this group accessed the program it would be another om buds usage rate of percent
note this percentage only includes issues of misconduct it does not include the most typical om buds program case types such as compensation or career development
given either example what is the explanation for the typical reported usage rate of only percent
the difference suggests significant number of potential users are for some reason not accessing om buds programs
one additional reference of work place need for om buds programs state of the global work place concludes percent of the employees have essentially checked out and an additional percent are acting out their unhappiness and undermining the accomplishments of the percent who are committed to innovation and organizational
considering these wide ranging topics from engagement loyalty and wrong doing if only percent percent of all the people experiencing just these challenges found their way to the om buds program one could anticipate at the very least double digit usage rates to be the norm
the authors contend that it is not because so few employees want help but because too few are aware understand or trust om buds programs
journal of the international ombudsman association andrea sch en ck and john
on the literature very few programs know or publish the actual percentages of people in the organization who are aware of the om buds program understand the program such that they can differentiate it from the other related functions and communications channels and therefore trust in advance of need that the om buds is truly independent and confidential and can actually be of meaningful assistance
the authors know of only one organization that annually queries their entire potential user population on the issues of awareness and understanding and subsequently reports the results to the entire workforce accompanied by message of support from the
during interviews for this article and elsewhere om buds have repeatedly stated they would like to do such surveys but do not have the resources or support to do so
others have explained their organizations are not interested in such information so they do not pursue it
this in turn expands the om buds capacity to reach and inform all potential users as well as help all actual program users
whether reading report issued by the gallup or any number of other polls or surveys about the work place the common findings are work experience for most is disengaged unsatisfied and fearful
this suggests large population with issues and concerns appropriate for om buds programs
yet they do not use the programs
it is unreasonable to expect that everyone with an issue would seek help from an om buds program
research shows the challenges of coming forward and seeking help are far greater than generally thought
help providers in particular can overestimate the likelihood of people seeking help
however nothing in this literature suggests the om buds community or host organizations should be satisfied with usage rates of percent
the case to expect more programs in the then ombudsman association and university and college ombudsman memberships totaled slightly more than
that same year the ethics and compliance officers association was founded with total members
this year has an approximate membership of membership equals
an additional belong to another competing association for total of approximately ethics officers
had the om buds community grown at the same rate as the ethics officer community there would be more than members
those original members of the were all in then fortune organizations
today more than percent of the fortune are represented in membership
by contrast total fortune representation is no more than percent
several factors which this article does not have the space to address contribute to the comparatively slow growth of organizational om buds programs in the fortune
however the authors believe the primary reason is that too few understand or appreciate the benefits
the field has been reluctant to enact the leading practice of programs fully declaring their contributions and value
consequently the function remains largely unknown and even less understood
journal of the international ombudsman association andrea sch en ck and john
inactions have contributed to the constrained growth of the field and the detriment of individual programs
while writing this article the authors became aware of two corporate programs that were eliminated and one which was
value is not just corporate issue
also while writing this article the university of colorado boulder presented its om buds program and all the other university departments and programs with an administrative program priori tiza ti on self study form to complete
comprised of more than questions the introduction explained the university of colorado boulder is undertaking program priori tiza ti on initiative to help us make strategic decisions about the priori tiza ti on of core academic and administrative resources in support of our mission
priori tiza ti on of administrative programs at cu boulder is intended to be an objective and evidence based process
emphasis the administrative program priori tiza ti on self study form questions how does your program align with the strategic plan
is it essential that the university offer this service
what would be the impact if the university did not offer this service
does your program align with the signature areas of research
consider is your program necessary or beneficial for the promotion of research teaching and outreach is your program value added although not required to educate students and enhance their success andor support other university goals or is your program critical to teaching learning research and discovery to take place
these and other questions demonstrate this interest in how all program activities including the om buds program align and contribute to the mission
conversely the authors became aware of two programs one corporate and one expanded or were considering expansion during the writing of this article because the organizations recognized the contributions and how those contributions were value additions to the organization
the international committee of the red deputy director general balthasar st ae hel in described the plan to expand their om buds function as and important step aligned with our strategic global
the case from other functions about value om buds are not alone in the challenge to identify their contributions
the university administrative program priori tiza ti on self study form queried all functions
simple searches reveal dozens of articles attempting to demonstrate the or of related formal functions such as human resources ethics compliance and employee assistance programs
measurement is an issue of the times
however those other related formal functions have better that is they are better understood and represented in organizations
more organizational leaders are aware of and understand these other functions
many leaders have staffed these other functions more than percent of fortune ce os have been high level hr managers for example none have been om buds
considering the related field of human resources it is generally accepted that an hr system effects its overall outcomes
research by ni sh ii and others puts forth otherwise effect of hr practices is not likely to be automatic and always as expected instead their effect will reside in journal of the international ombudsman association andrea sch en ck and john
meanings that employees attach to those
accordingly employee perception kn owl edge and belief about an om buds program then becomes paramount to capacity and the corresponding value addition
in reported the annual cost of governance risk and compliance consumes more than percent of an annual revenues
this vastly exceeds the cost of any om buds program
almost two thirds of respondents to the study considered bringing into single systemic unit cost rather than an investment and only percent said that they were effective at quantifying the benefits of these activities
the codified list of benefits includes smarter strategic effective resource lowered risk and control eliminated optimized capital automated minimized duplication of lowered vulnerability to reduced insurance premiums with the exception of automated work flows om buds programs also claim these contributions
these examples suggest employee attitude and what others in organizations are actively making case about what they contribute and why they should be valued
additionally many of the outcomes parallel om buds function contributions
given that most other functions are more common and therefore more understood om buds programs appear to have more work to ensure organizations can recognize their unique contributions and value
as an om buds from corporate program explained we are called on to do that which is beyond the standard expectation of managing the individual problem on case by case basis
we are here to aid leaders in thinking and complex problem solving
we are sought out for our opinion on important organizational decisions because of our connection
we are key thought partners to leaders and managers of all levels
this is where our greatest value is
greater degrees of are essential to achieve this degree of organizational trust and involvement
contribution refers to everything the organization gains everything that happens intended and unintended because the om buds program exists
contribution is way to all the activities of the om buds program and the om buds practitioner but also way to think of the impacts on those organizational members who do not have direct interface with the program yet are affected by it
andy former executive vice president in the office of the at baker hughes inc who was involved in the development of the his om buds program described this phenomenon saying employees knowing the program exists is just as important as using
this view point exists at the international committee of the red cross as well
the deputy director general balthasar st ae hel in explained the om buds program is an expression of interest in possible he continued are interested in platform and space for dialogue for preventative
journal of the international ombudsman association andrea sch en ck and john
contrast value addition is smaller set
value addition is what the organization recognizes and appreciates as occurring due to presence and activities
these additions can be both intended and unintended but the key is the recognition
om buds programs provide greater value addition as the program and the organization have negotiated the hoped for gains
jointly created and enacted appropriate processes data sharing definition generation executed under the heading of integration enable both the program to account for its contributions and then consequently for the organization to acknowledge the value
for example office of the om buds has global mandate which continues to expand annually
business needs identified through collaborative communicative process inform the choices regarding where the eat on program will next provide om buds services
such an program also connects with other functions
thus others can declare the value additions made by the om buds program
for example if because of the om buds program compliance experiences reduction in the number of hotline calls that do not need investigation because they did not rise to the legal threshold compliance could be one to suggest the om buds program impacted the situation
where contributions exist on the spectrum of value exists to the organization relying on the program as valued thought partner depends on the degree of
program designed implemented and operated with commitment to its alignment embedment and integration will be resource to the entire organization including leadership
the organization and the program will be in healthy dialogue about what is possible and needed from each to the other
ic rc ombudsman re to me is ter described this challenge for om buds saying if we hide behind the independence neutrality informality and confidentiality we are under exploiting the richness of the relationships and the position
we are not helping others to see the bigger picture we are not being good om buds if we only focus on resolving individual issues and copings
becoming aligned embedded and integrated value addition and its measurement depend upon
opportunities to increase are available to new and established programs alike
those organizations just beginning to consider program have the chance to
established programs can enhance their through changing program management activities with the intent to improve and expand communications relations and perceptions
for either new or established program the mission goals and objectives are the starting point to develop
these elements also inform the value addition measurement criteria
where performance is measured and reported the rate of improvement
journal of the international ombudsman association andrea sch en ck and john
added to this prescription as the field of visualization has repeatedly demonstrated yields even greater outcomes
several essential actions which require careful organizational and om buds program interface exist in order to create value
these points listed in figure could be considered the antecedents of contribution and value addition
how these activities are enacted and achieved establishes the tone and commitment of
with these essential elements in place foundation exists for programs to engage in the following five activities to support and enhance their contributions
talk about value while an organization identifies the value addition the om buds needs to initiate the dialogue which will establish what value is possible
so contributions can be fully recognized om buds must communicate with users potential users the authorizing environment and other stake holders what potential value the program could create
recognizing contribution as value addition is more likely when the expectation that it might happen and the framework to appreciate it already exists
this communication occurs optimally as part of the program design and implementation but can begin at any point
this dialogue should be repeated consistently as part of introduction and at regular intervals jointly reexamined with the authorizing environment
providing compilation of potential program value see figure and engaging stake holders in discussions of the organizational goals as well as what would the value addition ie how would they know it was occurred prepares an organization to both expect contributions and to recognize how the om buds program directly or indirectly facilitated these
essential elements to position program for contribution and value addition structural communications information charter or terms of reference which is cross referenced and congruent with other organization program design process aligned with mission values and culture of the program design process conducted utilizing essentials of om buds practice dialogue based open involvement including volunteers confidentiality for critical inputs and broad organizational protocols and materials tuned to organizational values culture and program governing body informed program information specialist position charged to connect the knowledge gains with the organization as appropriate orchestrated strategic communications plan including way to address crisis intranet web site page which updates with new information and engages external facing web om buds referenced and linked on other functions intranet pages materials and policies as appropriate and other functions referenced and linked on om buds intranet pages materials and policies as appropriate and possible regular connection meetings at predetermined and agreed to intervals with executive and management level heads of functional areas especially those with whom program does not otherwise regularly meet figure journal of the international ombudsman association andrea sch en ck and john
target current concerns communicate selected focus whether initiating or refreshing program understanding the organizational concerns which the om buds program could impact and describing those as focal effort for the program helps users potential users and the organization to understand why the program exists
simple statement of engagement or ethics and compliance can move the sometimes nebulous program into more understandable shape
most programs are designed to receive any work place issue or concern
but with limited resources advantageous for program to concentrate its attention eg resources marketing materials educational subjects etc
to the areas of most need
program cannot fully function if it operates in vacuum
doing so threatens long term sustain ability and limits an capacity to raise or support any recommended systemic change
in the majority of instances one issue is topic of concern for others
as an om buds program has the capacity to hear all types of concerns proclaiming those of particular interest to the organization writ large is quintessentially an activity
such targets are best defined annually in concert with the organization
the goal and annual objectives offer starting point
broaden and deepen relationships when understood championed and intentionally linked to all the stake holders but especially the authorizing environment program is not only well supported but reinforces and sustains program independence and neutrality
too few programs have been designed for any conclusive research at this time
anecdotal evidence however suggests an program generates greater framework of potential om buds program value additions economic organizational expanded increased preserved management enhanced operational advanced individual and team reduced disputing process and outcome costs improved reputation brand reduced incivility sabotage lowered or eliminated insurance supplemented navigated heightened enhanced protected and maximized personal responsibility increased ethical and compliant behavior advanced preprove nt at ive advantaged under the federal sentencing guidelines if wrong doing is increased strengthened organizational expanded enhanced creativity and risk taking augmented individualized career development heightened improved and preserved working relationships reduced incivility bullying mobbing isolating figure journal of the international ombudsman association andrea sch en ck and john
awareness understanding and trust especially when supported by governing or oversight body
the governing body serves several purposes including and monitor administrative consider and define in conjunction with the principal om buds the annual objectives and the degree to which objectives are the principal program not case management performance program identify and enable opportunities for the program to improve integration with the organization ensure where appropriate the program and its staff practice in accordance with the io ast and ar ds of practice and code of ethics sop coe
this cross functional committee comprised of seven to eleven members includes varying organizational levels including top tier leadership and other personal attributes which are representational
functional representation from the core activities eg medical staff for healthcare organizations teaching staff for educational organizations etc
not only the related formal functions legal human resources etc
this group supported and prepared with training is fully knowledgeable about the responsibilities and limitations of organizational om buds programs the sop coe so it can contribute to defining intended and desired impacts
with governing body viability is less likely to be determined by single person or function
governing body ensures greater reach via interpersonal networks
this group also provides an to support the principal om buds and the program with respect to additional resources eg different office locale or other needs that might need to be for
having this body pursue these discussions or needs helps preserve the perception of om buds and program neutrality and independence
this group in no way replaces the essential connection to the president of the university or an pinnacle leader as recommended by the standards of practice
however program built with only this dotted line to the pinnacle leader effectively limits the opportunity to integrate fully and to gain additional and diverse supportive voices
with reporting structure only to one program can be jeopardized when this relationship falters or the individual leaves the organization
establish mechanism to manage perceived om buds or program shortcomings almost no om buds programs have been designed or operate with mechanism to address complaints or concerns about an om buds or the program itself
how does this effect perceptions about program
could low program usage rates also be an indicator of lack of trust or confidence in program with no complaint mechanism for its own actions
om buds are human and the possibility exists for misjudgment or misconduct
it is critical to establish protocol to manage such situations
human resources legal or compliance are ill equipped to receive such an issue particularly if the person coming forward requires anonymity or cannot afford for others to know they worked with an om buds
the governing body described above is an appropriate locus for raising and addressing such concern
journal of the international ombudsman association andrea sch en ck and john
if the mechanism is never used to raise an issue which is the case to date with the program known to have this mechanism having and communicating the existence of such process could provide reassurance for some thus increasing the comfort and confidence for those seeking help from program
this mechanism also alleviates concerns that an independence and confidentiality could cover om buds misbehavior
leverage learning om buds often site as purpose help employees help
accordingly serving as an educational development and information resource offers another way to build
developing training whether in concert with other functions or independently based on identified issues emerging from om buds cases allows an om buds to show they recognize the needs of users potential users and the organization as whole
whether authoring the content for web based training reviewing articles and posting suggestions on their own web site om buds programs can provide numerous learning and development activities
these learning vehicle examples as listed in figure serve several purposes
learning creates contributions which can be recognized as value as they enhance knowledge and skills
secondly these interactions afford another opportunity for employees to know and further their trust in the program and practitioners
the chance to meet and talk to an om buds outside the parameters of conflict or difficulty can significantly personalize the om buds
even this limited set of five necessary activities could challenge the staffing levels of even multi member om buds programs let alone sole practitioner
there is no doubt that becoming and maintaining an program requires additional steps and more attention than the current standard
resource needs including staffing present an opportunity to advance integration
involving other parts of the organization including the recommended governing body can lead to more connections and understanding
in most organizations access to greater resources is best assured by creating value
figure learning development opportunities for increased host web in ars for knowledge and skill development on negotiation and other conflict management recommend andor deliver training on topics which emerge from observed trends and issues provide library on communication skills conflict negotiation problem solving etc

use web site publications and other venues to provide information resources and guidance about related topics journal of the international ombudsman association andrea sch en ck and john
may be necessary for existent programs to reexamine their time allocations to various tasks and reallocate activity to tasks intended to exp an
om buds of program could spend up to percent of their time on ae ire lated activities
this is stark contrast to the percent reported in simon and ro we presentation at the annual meeting
more recently over half of the petr om organizational om buds practices survey respondents did not include and in their top three activities
additionally the significant increased data needs of an program recommend dedicated information specialist
this responsibilities include connecting with other parts of the organization to establish shared definitions and defensible data sharing protocols while managing data basing informatics and report production
the expertise and demands of this position mean they are not available for case related work
this position is beginning to appear in larger om buds programs and could become an essential element of the fully aligned embedded and integrated om buds program of the future
company that communicates throughout the work place in an effective manner is more likely to avoid problems with completing the daily procedures and less likely to have problem with improper occurrence and will generate stronger morale and more positive attitude towards work
when employees communicate effectively with each other productivity will increase because effective communication means less complaints and more work getting done
organizational om buds programs properly positioned and structure foster effective communication to deliver all the benefits and the inherent value described above
as both implicit and explicit communication multipliers om buds augment both the performance and humanity of organizations
andy championed the development of the baker om buds program
upon first learning about the concept he thought the program could be useful safety valve to relieve pressure for people when they had problem and as another way to resolve issues without having to resort to legal procedures two typical descriptions of what programs can provide
now more than year into operations the first chair of the om buds governance committee still sees pressure release as an important point for the program but he also sees other contributions as key value addition made by the the creation of more positive environment
sets an atmosphere that the company cares and values its
he added also channel for leadership to learn things it does not know have an expanded understanding of where people are and what they are thinking
especially from those who feel disenfranchised
all of this helps managers be more informed so they can make better
this example shows how as program moves toward its it gains greater opportunities to add recognized value through more diverse activities which tie into the broad needs
journal of the international ombudsman association andrea sch en ck and john
embedment and integration set context where more people in the organization will be aware of the program understand the intent and activities on higher level and therefore the program more
there is every indication that this will lead to higher caseloads
higher caseloads inturn generate greater opportunities for more program contribution in high setting these became recognized as value additions
this organizational recognition will increase both the perceived value of the function and almost certainly the real value addition
those in organizations talk about that which they value that which they benefit from that which aids them in advancing their mission and achieving their intended goal
they build processes to secure and ensure viability for such functions
in so doing they guarantee greater awareness and provide greater resources which further strengthen the alignment and integration and continually en value the embedding
then the cycle begins again and ascends
an ascending spiral that mirrors the organizations aspiration ascent is the demonstrative image for this process
the last increasing interest in determining organizational om buds program contribution and value creation is much needed development
to be widely recognized and well understood profession with an increasingly common presence practitioners and the field need broader commitment to align embed and integrate programs in order to first better serve program users and second to account for their contributions and fully measure their value
the particular cultural context of om buds programs will always mean diverse operating realities and specific adjustments organization to organization
ro we writes is no single method of measuring cost
and there is no single method for an om buds program to be properly aligned embedded and integrated
and there is no single way to account for all om buds contributions and value additions
each program must undertake organization specific activities to become in order to inventory their contributions as value additions and report what is discovered
addition alignment repeat all figure journal of the international ombudsman association andrea sch en ck and john
and proper value recognition actually protects an om buds defining characteristics
recognizing value reinforces the importance of the defining characteristics by generating for the stake holders clear understanding and correlation of the organizational benefit as well as individual om buds program gain through the unique value proposition of the characteristics
the defining characteristics require practitioners to behave differently than all other members of given organization
this organizationally provided privilege the ability to do that which no one else may is rare and valuable
the organization bold enough to allow one of its functions and number of its members to behave the to the extent that om buds must deserves to expect gains from the function and to understand clearly and accurately just what contributions and value have been made
likewise the om buds role as voice of conscience monitor of organizational fairness does not require the program to disconnect from the organization for or hold high moral ground which determining contribution would diminish
without legitimate and defensible processes to determine and demonstrate value additions the om buds program becomes ancillary and thus dispensable
however an aligned embedded and integrated om buds function which expends the needed energy to help broad internal constituency and especially those shareholders identified as the authorizing environment has workable preconception of possible value along with intentional predetermined desired effects and will be best able to recognize om buds program contributions as value additions
this program will become the type of sought out and trusted advisor capable of returning the greatest possible value
this emergent paradigm is currently demonstrating its worth in limited applications
additional research such as roi studies leadership support surveys and assessing potential user perceptions of awareness understanding and trust and especially additional enactment of this framework are needed to demonstrate that it is repeatable and universally valuable

the authors in their own practice respect and uphold the sop coe and require the same of any client or collaborating partner
the authors do not condone or promote any action or inaction that in fact or appearance would undermine or diminish the sop coe
this article distinguishes between an om buds program and an om buds practitioner
though each are quite different it is common even within the field to use om buds ie the practitioner when one actually means the program
especially when only one person staffs program confusing the program with the person is understandable
throughout the discussions and interviews as well as writing this article the authors too found they sometimes used when they intended om buds program
it is imperative to distinguish the program from the practitioner as each has distinct roles and responsibilities
thinking of both as one in the same creates rate limiting factors on what practitioner can do for users what program can contribute to its organization and how the organization recognizes the value added as well as the general understanding of the field
program should not be person and person is not program
for one the sop coe manifests differently for both
for example while program should never be positioned or placed such that it takes and nor should the om buds practitioner existence is not to be
what then would be the point
an organization implements an organizational om buds program for variety of reasons but the underlying expectation is that it will contribute to creating better environment for all
this article emphasizes programmatic necessities alignment embedding and integration in order to expand contributions and the recognized value additions program can make
of course these activities are executed by people they do not however all have to be executed solely by the om buds
organizational leaders personnel from related functions administrators managers an om buds governing body and even external consultants can contribute and may in fact be better positioned in some instances to ensure some of these programmatic activities occur and in so doing protect the independence neutrality confidentiality and informality of the om buds practitioner

charles howard the organizational ombudsman origins roles and operations legal guide chicago american bar association
alignment relates to the connection and commitment an om buds program has with the purpose or mission of the host organization
alignment includes the recognition by the om buds program personnel that they have something to add to the organization something which makes the organization better than it would be without the program but also moves the organization ahead to achieving the organizational mission vision and goals
ideally all in the organization perceive and appreciate this alignment of purpose especially those who use the program
journal of the international ombudsman association andrea sch en ck and john
be clear the authors are advocating for programmatic alignment
that is the om buds program needs to be aligned while the om buds practitioner remains independent neutral informal and confidential
especially as regards there must be clarity
neutrality pertains to management of case or interfaces in the public venue such as an om buds not being an official voting member of committee or taking part in formal process
the program must be functional addition to the organization
it must provide contribution which the organization sees as value
if the program is judged to be neutral as regards its contribution and value addition the organization will by necessity jettison it
embedment is the proper structural placement of an om buds program throughout the organization including mechanisms for oversight or governance access to all types of power means of correction and redress for om buds actions inactions
embedding is also aided by proper description of these aspects in the terms of reference or charter
integration references the many workable connections between an om buds program and those other functions in the organization especially those with which there is the greatest need to interact to achieve the om buds mission and goals
different organizations having different needs and desires from an om buds program will lead to the program integrating with different functions at various levels eg an organization desiring an increase in workforce engagement might lead the om buds program to integrate more highly with organizational development and learning to greater extent than the organization looking to the om buds program for dramatic increase in ethics and compliance reporting
integration looks like appropriate regular communications the establishment of appropriate shared criteria for events and data exchange so that coordinated understanding of what each function om buds and ethics for example receive and experience from the other

this presentation presented an extensive list of stake holders
mary ro we has spent considerable time and energy employing her singular ability to build what must be considered the definitive list of organizational stake holders who connect with the om buds and om buds programs
on thursday may at the semiregular meeting of the east coast om buds group whole group discussion on the issue of alignment value return and its potential impact on neutrality occurred
among the many voices heard were mary ro we and john who disagreed about the use of the word
the group struggled with the notion of who the value created by an om buds
there is question as to whether the group considered om buds rather than only om buds practitioners
it is clear now however the discussion needed to extend to include the om buds program as well
just as the authors encourage distinction between and they also separate management or leadership from the organization
the authors use the term to refer to the entire entity the collective of all that comprise it not just the ownership or designated leaders

mary ro we shared many thoughts and much encouragement for the writing of this article

was also inspired by the contributions about neutrality from robert she lt on tom gerald pa pica in duma ti sen brian blo ch nancy er be and howard gad lin
david encouragement and guidance were essential for this work
finally for helping me develop the courage and methods to question authority thank my friend ira chal eff author of the book the courageous follower
been retired as an organizational ombudsman for two years
was thinking about questioning authority in my role decade before retiring but the passage of time since has allowed me to reflect on what seems most important to share on the topic now
this proved difficult to write both because have too many thoughts and experiences for single article and the topic is complex and often uncomfortable part of my career
the writing feels more like small research project with my career as the subject that is bringing me to different conclusion than predicted
that included looking at why engaging with and especially questioning authority figures was such challenge often leaving me feeling quite ineffective
intended these encounters to be opportunities that would help them see their unique and controllable contributions to organizational conflict
this meant directly or indirectly questioning how they viewed their role and actions if not their self image
these situations were opportunities to acknowledge and manage my own limitations biases personality preferences and passion about and orientation to authority so that could help rather than hinder my effectiveness in questioning
considered each interaction an important opportunity to have high leverage dialog for positive change
of course that loaded the encounters with much higher risks of failure and damage to the brand whether real or imagined
my costlier mistakes at least as defined errors of practice at the time usually involved cases of honest and candid discussion with journal of the international ombudsman association don no ack authority figures
once every few years authority reactions to those mistakes seemed so detrimental to the reputation question whether had the skills or sufficient credibility to remain in the job or should resign
with less emotional hindsight and feedback that even imperfect handling of each situation yielded some positive results rethink bailing out of the enterprise
to paraphrase an american revolutionary era figure thomas pay ne these were the cases that tried my soul
they were seldom comfortable interactions no matter how solid and respectful the relationship
it helped to balance my critical sense of ineffectiveness by appreciating that been authentically present with good intentions even when falling far short of perfect practice
dozen and no noo colleagues contacted who negotiate with coach and question authority figures have shared similar experiences and challenges
apparently all of us had walked and tripped over the fine line between an authority acceptance of our helpful intentions and their perception that their prerogative was being unhelpfully questioned
gradually came to view questioning authority as an archetypal dilemma for all humans with unique challenges for oos
it has been and will continue to be growth and development process for me as much personal as professional
my post career volunteer activities in religious hierarchy present the same challenges and uncomfortable theme as in my role as an when it comes to questioning authority was not and am not neutral
not that was unable to engage neutrally in my career
while maintaining neutrality is one of the practical requirements that allows oos to get through the door of authority figures easier it was not reflective of my inner orientation to authority
ro we and gad lin wrote this about related fundamental the perspective of any of the sophisticated frameworks from which we now understand organizational dynamics systems theory network theory complexity theory it is difficult to believe that an effective can really be independent in the full sense of that
based on experiences of interacting with and questioning authority and my understanding of human dynamics am equally disbelieving that could be an effective and neutral in the full sense of that term
managed my judgment of authority figures and their decisions thanks to general compassion for struggling humans at any level especially when they betray even modicum of vulnerability fear and willingness to learn
however when those characteristics were displaced by tunnel vision hubris or the preference to exercise rights and power could feel judgment rising and my neutrality slipping
ironically it felt less risky to question authority figures with whom had respectful and mutually understanding relationship but was clearly no more neutral
in considering whether when and how had questioned authority as an thought it helpful to reflect on the progression or perhaps regression in my career from mostly positive to respectfully cynical biases toward authority in general and individually
perhaps now read this as cautionary tale
rather than mine the international ombudsman association standards of practice sops code of ethics best practices and sources of power for strategies to question authority focus on the less concrete aspects of the topic
these are admittedly personal opinion based on professional experience and may touch on aspects the reader will label as sociological psychological and philosophical
whatever the labels the thoughts below help me understand the complexity experienced of this essential role and provide clues to my struggles with it
welcome and think practitioners need countering thoughts and viewpoints about questioning authority
who is an authority and what might an question them about
charter helps but an conundrum but feel neutral an self awareness nature of organizational authority necessary and parental journal of the international ombudsman association don outside world influences both questionability and fear of questioning authority for visitors authorities and oos helpful resources who is an authority and what might an question them about
an authority is someone near the top of any hierarchical organization or its constituent units regents board chairs executives directors bishops and priests managers members of government agencies either oversight or investigative members of congress or other governing bodies supervisors team and project leaders those in human resources personnel legal ethics compliance security or other administrative investigative or decision making offices
fair to also consider authority in the form of policies procedures laws bylaws and rules
however could not interact with or question policy
would need to question someone charged with the stewardship of these documents and invested in preserving their authority
that person would exercise various sources of power over the application and protect it from weakening
was most effective when gauged such investment accurately
was most ineffective when forgot that questioning the policy under their stewardship could be interpreted as undermining or devaluing their role in the organization
the american bar standards for the establishment of om buds offices provides other examples of areas about which an might question authority allegations of unfairness maladministration abuse of power abuse of discretion discourteous behavior or incivility inappropriate application of law or policy inefficiency decision unsupported by fact and illegal or inappropriate
ro we and gad lin note additional situations in organizational
an might managerial policies and the actions of managers and question both leaders and employees if they do not honor the values or properly implement its policies and identify mistakes omissions problems conflicts and surface serious infractions of policies rules and laws acts of omission and commission against the organizational
recalled other risky and mostly unofficial areas about which had questioned authorities competing professional personal or business values possible down sides of exercising power and rights ineffective emotionally charged and possibly threatening communications and behaviors actual or perceived damage to or professional standing low trustworthiness hindering organizational partnerships
such topics came from visitors asking the to take the question forward independent observations direct experience of authority figures or aggregate visitor data
the issue could be urgent high risk high consequence or have more obvious impact on the authority figure and those under that authority
however the majority of situations of questionable authority were of lower urgency risk or tangible consequence
they collectively represented negative impact for the efficiency and mission that was more insidious and difficult to question authorities about let alone help them generate the energy to address
seldom did encounter an issue rising to the level of formal whistle blowing
however observed that dismissive abusive or threatening responses by an authority to the questioner increased the odds of creating just such formal charge
journal of the international ombudsman association don no ac ka broader range of scenarios in which been perceived as questioning authority presented risks that were much more subtle but no less real
an authority could feel questioned in coaching session or routine trend meeting
reporting on an organizational assessment requested by an authority could indirectly question their decisions skills and awareness of the people they managed
beyond my own experiences wondered how many times an was seen as questioning the validity of information simply by requesting information relevant to complaint
how many times has an preserved confidentiality and visitor anonymity only to be interpreted as questioning whether the authority could be trusted to remain non retaliatory
how many times have authority figures questioned fairness and neutrality upon hearing of their perceptions of the omissions problems conflicts and
can recall management employee situation in which was judged to be blocking multi month termination process simply by asking clarifying questions of the managers human resources and medical and legal departments
any of the above situations can unexpectedly change an perception of the from helpful resource to judge
feel it necessary to note that questioning authority is not about challenging the prerogative of an authority figure to take action or make decisions which easily launches an unnecessary and unhelpful power struggle
however it is possible that certain situations might call for taking the question of an authority misappropriation or abuse of prerogative to higher level of authority
finally feedback from small number of authority figures led me to understand that even silent presence or offering no more than single reframe in tough discussion left them feeling questioned
and to the extreme discovered that some authority figures considered the mere existence of an om buds office in the organization an unappreciated statement that organizational authority could be questioned
the impact of un supportive authority figures was mitigated somewhat by years of building effective relationships with those authority figures supportive of the office
charter helps but an conundrum persists the relationship between and organizational authority starts wonderfully enough even as it establishes the conundrum president of the xyz corporation or university is pleased to announce board of directors or regents approval of the charter for an ombudsman of fice
the ombudsman and office assistant have been selected through an open process
the ombudsman will serve as confidential neutral and independent conflict resolution special ist for all employees and management or faculty students and staff
the and om buds bl og trumpet this press release about the move by an obviously enlightened xyz management to provide beneficial office for all
that charter based on guidelines undoubtedly serves as an essential cornerstone for the role with boundaries and roles in black and white for all to agree on
indeed if authority figures at all levels of the organization revered and demonstrably supported the terms within the sop code of ethics and best practices as much as oos do this article would be unnecessary
the hard truth however is that this announcement initiates tension dance of competing interests between the and the authorities who charter the office
summarize the conundrum this presents in two questions how able and willing is an to question decision making information and processes or to point out unproductive or abusive behaviors by those authorities who support fund and promote the use of an office
how willing are such authorities to be questioned by an
these journal of the international ombudsman association don no ack are obvious enough that even new hires in their weekly intake orientations would ask the skeptical questions about my neutrality is it you work for again
and does your paycheck come from
wi lc ox and gad lin described the value of an office in helping those who unacceptable fear loss of relationships loss of privacy retaliation or just consequences
people may worry about being seen as troublemaker
many do not feel sure of themselves
many feel they do not have to
how often might these words describe the concerns of an especially when to see through the pretenses and subterfuges by which abusive or overbearing managers maintain their organizational
questioning an in my experience was seldom received well but howard gad lin offered mitigating strategy at the conference
his approach is to use the early conversations in new relationship with an authority figure to let them know that he may need to make difficult observations that could be perceived as questioning their authority
this suggests that by stating his or her professional role and explaining that such questioning could be uncomfortable for both in stressful or difficult case the could assure the authority figure that the intention is to resolve the issue as respectfully as possible
this conundrum became more real to me during the last three years before retiring
was battling for sufficient annual budgets from management
was also watching other corporate offices coveting and competing for the same organizational role and credibility as trusted office
what of this was visible to the work place community
how did the optics affect the perceived levels of credibility trustworthiness and courage of the office to put needed information and questions on the table of authorities
how effective could the be as truthteller or questioner to those controlling budget or having no real stake in the office
these were unanswerable and yet helpful questions since they raised the awareness of those of us in the office about the fragility of neutrality objectivity and independence
fortunately these questions surfaced late in my career when was more straightforward in presenting them to upper management as risks the office must acknowledge and manage
but feel neutral an self awareness reflected on when and why in my career had spoken truth to power effectively and courageously
in the early years recall it being often
tended to believe that management tries hard is benevolently inclined views employees fairly gets most decisions right and could do with less questioning of its authority
neither incorrect nor the whole story it was pleasant and crippling bias for an
during the first half of my career unfortunately recall delaying tough conversations with authorities at least partly due to my struggle with maintaining the ideals of neutrality independence impartiality and objectivity
after my retirement read and identified with the descriptions by ro we and gad lin of the principles of independence and neutrality
the organizational ombudsman dilemmas and challenges looking back comfort myself about the gap between preserving these ideals and my imperfect practices by focusing on helpful word in standard of practice ombudsman strives for impartiality fairness and did navigate the sops in ways that maintained neutrality but still gave authority figures or offices necessary feedback that was uncomfortable to hear or challenging to respond to
but when had misapplied or hidden behind the sops using vagueness to soften the information and preserve favorable authority relationship
in which situations had protected such personal or professional interests by remaining silent failing to either find credible way for me to journal of the international ombudsman association don no ack question or to cultivate an alternate questioner
in these failings had colluded with authorities to maintain an unhealthy organizational status quo or worse not done enough to prevent an unethical corporate outcome
am uncomfortable considering these answers but keys to gaining integrity around neutrality and in decisions about questioning authority
by mid career had broadened my biases to more neutral less rose colored balance
grew more clear eyed about error prone human authorities especially in groups
noticed more instances in which they were at least as likely to make march of folly barbara tu chm an and myopic decisions as courageous mutually beneficial and higher minded decisions
from then on it seemed wise to be skeptically respectful if secretly cynical of authorities
was more straightforward with them too
at times had consciously and appropriately rationalized risked objectivity and impartiality to make point for greater good or fairness for all
looking honestly at these situations also concluded that there is nothing neutral about wanting situation to turn out better for all
was more aware of gradually developing more realistic but risky negative biases about authority figures and groups
these were as unhealthy for an as early career positive biases toward them had been
unfortunately always fully aware that they were affecting how questioned authority which was often with an excess of passion intended to break through an resistance rather than work with it
was fooling myself into thinking could practice neutrally with these biases
what had helped me build this negative bias
the short answer is many experiences with authority holders
the longer answer is at least partially described in the sections below
coaching and mediation gave me sense of professional accomplishment
however witnessing when unquestioned authority would decide and act in ways detrimental to the organization added personal mission to take on the responsibility to speak truth to power
it also clarified that was not as skilled and grounded as needed to be to do so effectively
grew to appreciate the occasional experiences of authority displeasure and especially when done my best to be respectful served higher values whether stayed attentive to the sops or stretched their interpretation
through these cases gained insight into my experiences of both obvious and skillfully veiled reprisal
also lost my that the charter office alignment with power and adherence to the sops served to buffer if not indemnify oos and their offices
they are necessary and helpful but not guarantees
discussion of self awareness about an orientation to authority seem complete without nod to the human development path
with apologies to the reader for my presumptions suspect that most of us learned early in life who is and about the authority of rules
we learned of responses that felt good when we stayed within the lines and pleased authority figures and of consequences that felt uncomfortable when we strayed
perhaps you can recall your experiences that might have included the pain of corporal punishment the shame of the the guilt at judgmental glance or the anxiety of the silent treatment from mom
as we grew up we obeyed many authorities followed most of the rules tested both forms of authority chafed against some and violated others
through adolescent years we traveled the rocky road of learning to negotiate with authority holders to meet mutual interests
some of us master this by adulthood but certainly not everyone one reason we have visitors
as we entered the world of employment for compensation from corporate authority with new policies and rules we sensed the whole journey starting over with different yet somehow familiar kind of authority relationship
we relearned that following the dictates of authority offered the opportunity for hefty journal of the international ombudsman association don no ack rewards and questioning them could carry tangible costly risks
if prudent adults we never stop refining our understanding of the nature of authority and its relationship with us
even though an oversimplified view of human development it helps me make sense of my relationship to and fear of authority
the fear seems deeper than the possible loss of livelihood or community although both are daunting enough
as an became student of the language behaviors and decisions made in the work place
these led me to posit that adults at all levels of the organizational hierarchy are still rooted in the universally experienced parental authority model
much like the operating system on our computers imagine it as the controlling program behind the relationship between those with and those under authority
as such it influences both our inclination to follow authority and our trepidation at questioning it
is not uttered by an authority irritated at being questioned by subordinates or an is strikingly similar to the words parent uses when irritated at child or teenager
this phrase unambiguously and parentally marks authority as unquestionable
the home and the work place are the only two places ever heard the phrase uttered and always with an energy intended to sharpen the point
it was only one of many indicators noticed that hierarchical structures lean toward the parental authority model
does it sufficiently validate my theory
but it has helped me visitors and yes authority holders make sense of many an situation in which questioning authority causes difficult behaviors to emerge
the risks of questioning increase because hierarchical authority is rightly considered the source of order stability effectiveness and organizational mission success
absent or weakened authority yields disastrous results
it seems prudent then to assume authority holders are deeply invested in preserving authority
once they take on that role we can add host of unique factors and characteristics in considering how they might respond to questioning hierarchical level and comfort in it temperament and personality preferences my ers briggs personal and career missions beliefs and values emotional intelligence level pressures on them from authorities to whom they report family background and life experiences and whether they were bad
the list is long and mostly unknowable but oos can be in position to discover and weigh these factors more than others in an organization to help decide when and how to question authority holders
clearly decisions must weigh broader organizational values and sustain ability more heavily than the values of individuals over whom authority is exercised
this makes situational if not systemic imbalances injustice and unfairness unavoidable regardless of their best intentions
oos have visitors because of these imbalances
but if not questioned such imbalances are not manageable
unfortunately hierarchical authority systems are less adept at identifying acknowledging and managing the down sides of decisions
indeed single minded focus on the benefits is natural defense for authorities against questioning they believe will undermine or stall execution of the decision
to put finer point on it experienced that most authority figures believe that authority ques ti on ed on situational basis weakens or undermines authority writ large
this describes factor of constant threat that failed to account for at my peril even in authority relationships thought were stable and trusting
can only guess that this vigilance required against any threat to authority explains the need for whistle blower protection laws like the no fear act
the authority questioner journal of the international ombudsman association don no ack must be viewed at least initially as an adversary of organizational order and stability
recall the old managerial dictum follow or get out of the
no wonder questioning authority is perceived as risky business
outside world influences both questionability and fear of questioning authority for visitors authorities and oos reading of historic and current events contributed to my biases about the inherent questionability of authority
while still an noticed how relatively recent events in society influenced and thoughts fears and actions inside the organization
the corporate setting of my practice was microcosm of the outside world but was often treated by authorities as if isolated from it
this seemed quite unrealistic given the twenty four hour news cycle employing instant and investigative if not exploitive journalism to relate many stories of questionable authority
in the march of folly from troy to vietnam barbara tu chm an describes this folly through examples in which authorities blocked or ignored contemporary questioning
in addition they were deaf to disaffection of those under their authority blind to alternative ideas unconcerned by the dismay at their misconduct and stubborn in their refusal to change
in such cases unquestioned decisions often worked against the best interest of the authorities themselves as well as those under the authority sometimes for decades
in my lifetime alone instances of such folly serve as instructive examples military and political mismanagement of the vietnam war the run up to the savings and loan crisis of the both of space shuttle disasters dubiously launched global military interventions like the iraq war prosecuted primarily on assumptions of weapons of mass destruction never found the wall street myopia and ethical lapses leading up to the financial collapse of including the lack of accountability among bad actors now reaping record profits the li bors scandal in europe in which financial institutions were convicted of colluding to manipulate interest rates to their favor only to be deemed unpunishable big to plethora of governmental and corporate whistle blower cases that historically do not turn out well for the whistle blower eg edward snow den daniel manning
in the aftermath of the snow den case the president of the us reasserted the no fear act to urge people to question authority through proper channels without fear of retribution
by most reports and the history of whistle blowers more good intention than credibility in his words
all familiar with similar corporate statement should report issues without fear of
there was no statement its equal for creating incredulity in employees in my former corporate culture
there are other examples of the apparent questionability of authority in these stories
the american public has rightfully questioned the credibility of the federal lawmaking authorities the current congress with good reason it continues its inexorable march toward the highest multipartisan contention levels and lowest productivity and public approval levels of any congress in decades
the us military adds its example with deplorable record in acknowledging and addressing the rape of female service members
even under congressional scrutiny the military command resists external prosecution of such cases apparently intending to preserve internal hierarchical prerogative at the cost of preventing or limiting justice
journal of the international ombudsman association don no ac ka recent national public radio report hailed the courage of robert gates formerly president secretary of defense for writing behind the scenes critical account of inconsistencies in government resolve and decision making as it prosecuted war
two of the statements reflect our national norm about speaking truth to power he dared to publish before the president was out of office but after he knew there was little hope of serving again in government
to pull me out of depression about these examples note the recent celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the rev
dr martin luther speech at the march for civil rights and jobs
while no human endeavor is perfect and the full story is more complex on balance the civil rights movement is one of the better examples of the power of persistent ethical and effective questioning of the authority of majority to control minority
authority has rarely seemed as questionable as it is now or as unsafe for the questioner but writings remind me this has been going on since humans organized carrying even higher risks in distant history
indeed craig mo us in clergy person at de paul university and conference panel member added the historical perspective of the experiences of biblical prophets not to mention the namesake of the christian faith
none survived speaking ethical but inconvenient truths to authorities in both the religious institutions and governments of their times
why mention such stark responses to speaking truth to power
because they seem embedded in collective human psyche already programmed to yield to authority unless pushed to moral action
speaking truth to power today in the us seldom results in death but it still results in adverse consequences in the work place where economic reputation al and social connection losses can be just as large and threatening for modern day truth tellers
this is the world oos deal with daily in situations large and small
appreciated three resources for developing strengths in deciding whether when and how to question authority while better managing my biases and weaknesses the courageous fol lo weri write of oos as if we are like any other member or employee of an organization
of course we are and we are not adding to the already long list of contradictory obligations competing values and oxymoronic aspects of practice blo ch gad lin ro we
came to grips with this particular contradiction in as considered my follower role as an after reading the courageous follower standing up to and for our leaders by ira chal eff
in his third edition the author added sixth and quite timely trait followers should develop courage to speak to the hierarchy
the final chapter encourages authority figures to develop the courage to listen to followers
the entire book and especially these two chapters should be required reading for oos and authority figures with whom they interact
it provided many examples for coaching both visitors and me to effectively and courageously speak truth to power
it has also aided my personal and growth in managing my weaknesses better as tried to model for those in and under authority what respectful questioning looks like in hierarchy
journal of the international ombudsman association don no ack polarity management oos are uniquely equipped to assist authority figures even in the midst of questioning them by appreciating their tough tasks and providing model to them for balance seemingly polar opposite viewpoints or needs
barry book polarity management identifying and managing unsolvable problems has been invaluable to me in supplying process to help authorities fully understand and manage both intended effects and unintended consequences of their decisions
it supplies more complete picture of reality to increase their effectiveness in communicating taking action and mitigating the down sides of exercised authority
field guide to good decisions what has further helped me and my visitors is value based decision making process for determining when to up and when to up for authorities
such process is outlined by mark ben nett and joan gibson in the book field guide to good decisions
it is straightforward approach to weighing most important to visitors authorities and the including summary of human biases that skew decisions
find it critical to acknowledge and manage several of these biases in deciding whether to question authority
rationalization bias might find me justifying my decision based on story constructed about authority rather than the values of the visitor or organization
status quo bias is important for thinking through whether greater good might be served in leaving situation related to authority just as it is or not
framing bias and loss aversion each contribute to faulty inflation of at stake if my questioning were experienced by the authority figure as ineffective or worse nonneutral and judgmental
closing was fortunate to amass considerable supply of benevolent social capital as an by way of effectively helping all parties result of my commitment to multi partiality
management on balance was supportive appreciating the need for adherence to the sops and code of ethics
this was due in no small part to consistency between my presentations and practices
in some cases however found that more practical if impure definitions of neutrality and objectivity increased my ability to help all parties and the organization find the greater good
for novice and veteran oos reading this as rationalization perhaps you are correct
spent many years wrestling with the real world application of our sops comforted only by feedback that was at least more neutral and more objective than any of the deeply invested or polarized parties in the situation
knew that neutrality referenced in the charter was an important for questioning authority but also knew that pristine neutrality is at best fragile and fleeting
occasionally struggled with honoring both the spirit and letter of the sops through my practices but without them had no touchstones
they were and are reasoned and wisely drawn maps of territory but more research dialog and mentor ing would help oos deal with the paradoxes they present in hierarchical world
without more such supporting contributions from learned and experienced oos the sops are no more accurate in helping an with reality than map of northern arizona provides the experience of visiting the grand canyon
end with few random thoughts about questioning authority that invite managing any negative biases toward them wise finds and encourages authority constructive strengths through regular relationship and trust building that opens the door to credible questioning
managing any positive biases is equally important to an so that the impetus for questioning authority is not weakened in critically important situations
journal of the international ombudsman association don authority especially as exercised by authority groups must be questionable by those under that authority if commitment to preventing groupthink and sustaining organizational learning and improvement
while questioning provides an authority with important preventive and consequential feedback about management decisions and policies the act of questioning is equally important as modeling of healthy upward interactions in hierarchy
resistance to this orientation can signal that holder believes that questioning their authority will weaken or undermine it
the is well positioned to build authentic relationships with authority holders and capacity for having tough candid questioning conversations
but the is not and must be wise in taking and managing risks
reese ra mos who at the conference framed his role as that of court jester embraces in this role the responsibility to be the one person in the organization who can more safely question or the emperor he has no
there will be both benefits and consequences for doing so but exercising the courage to speak truth to power is necessary responsibility of followers
oos are uniquely positioned to model this for both followers and leaders
that courage is most effective when joined with tangible skills and an intangible faith that benefits will outweigh negative consequences for the messenger
continue to deal with both learned and chosen orientations to authority holders managing my weaknesses and limitations in questioning them and looking for guideposts to develop my strengths and be encouraged
one such guidepost is in the last paragraph of the preamble of the code of ethics ombudsman shall be truthful and act with integrity shall foster respect for all members of the organization he or she serves and shall promote procedural fairness in the content and administration of those practices processes and
found these words resonating with me as well an institution specifically establishes an office outside the hierarchical structure and with access to the entire system with the expectation that this person is to keep an eye on the whole rooted in the values and conscience of the institution persons will turn to that office to relieve the tension produced by their role in the organization and help them to be
robert she lt on invested many years building relationships with authority to them to be which necessarily included questioning that authority

authors should learn from reviews and take away from the review sense of future direction and beneficial development for their paper
the aim of the review is to strengthen contributions to the and thereby strengthen the ombudsman profession
in this sense review is as much critique of the reviewer as of the manuscript
accordingly it is requirement that all reviews offer information that can help guide the author
although reviews are confidential ie the manuscript author does not know who the reviewers are they are best written as though the author is in the room
accordingly useful test of the assertions is the test if they were standing in the dock at the old bailey would they be able to justify their assertions to the author
are they making statements that are justifiable verifiable and credible or just say so
does the tone of their review convey the standards of practice in practice
reviewers are asked to look out for issues of comprehension in manuscripts make strong recommendations where appropriate for authors to break up long avoid and where possible eliminate maintain only one idea per sentence

the aims for the lowest possible fog indexes for manuscripts
where criticism is appropriate it should ideally be constructive and be contextual ised within set of options given by the reviewer for modification of the text

suggestions for modification should not be returned to the editor in the form of in the original manuscript

evaluation organizational ombudsman methodology performance international organization marie bomb in
ethics officer world health organization geneva switzerland methods used in evaluating the ombudsman function of an international organization in in the context of comprehensive reform process the world health organization who carried out an evaluation of its ombudsman function
the reform process which includes the areas of governance programming and management identified the administration of internal justice as key area to improve
the ombudsman function is critical in addressing workplace related conflicts and an evaluation was required to assess its overall effectiveness
effectiveness was understood as measure of the extent to which desired outcome or objective is achieved
the aim of this article is to outline the reflection process that underlay the choice of valid methodological approach to assess ombudsman function and provide meaningful analysis of its effectiveness in delivering on its mandate
the article describes how the evaluation process started by questioning the definition of the term as applied to an organization such as who and the impact of this definition on the objectives and principles of the function
it then marie bomb in journal of the international ombudsman association marie bomb in acknowledges the limitations to assessing the performance of an office based on the principles of neutrality informality confidentiality and independence and describes how the evaluation sought to identify meaningful indicators of effectiveness
the article then explains how the evaluation opted to assess effectiveness by examining the relevance of the ombudsman mandate and supporting policy framework ii the efficiency of its operational processes and its adherence to professional principles and ultimately iii its contribution to organizational change
who is specialized agency of the united nations un concerned with international public health
more than people from more than countries work for the organization in who offices in countries territories and areas six regional offices and at the headquarters in geneva switzerland
the organization is headed by the director general dg who is appointed by the world health assembly member states on the nomination of the executive board members
the six who regions africa americas eastern mediterranean europe southeast asia and western pacific are governed by regional committees composed of member states that elect their regional directors
the ombudsman based at hq and reporting to the dg thus operates in highly decentralized structure
the starting point of the evaluation was to review the definition of an and examine ensuing implications in terms of understanding the objectives and principles of the function
the term is gender neutral in origin
variations of the term exist ie om buds ombudsperson and are common among those practicing in the ombudsman field
at the most fundamental level an ombudsman assists individuals and groups in the resolution of conflicts or concerns
there are different types of ombudsman with different roles functional responsibilities and standards of practice
expectations of the ombudsman role are not homogenous and clarifying what the role of an ombudsman should be in the context of an international organization such as who is key to assessing the performance
the first task of the evaluation was therefore to reflect on the definition of the
this had wide ranging implications in terms of the expectations of the function and the ways in which it operates
who as most international organizations follows the model of the as opposed to the shown in figure
accordingly the who ombudsman makes recommendations but takes no decisions and does not perform formal investigations
journal of the international ombudsman association marie bomb in figure classical vs
organizational ombudsman classical ombudsman organizational ombudsman created by generally appointed by legislative receive complaints about acts of official designated often have the power of perform formal may or may not be created by not appointed by legislative often serve internal may serve external handle problems and complaints designated perform informal reviews do not investigate source coalition of federal ombudsmen bearing this definition of an organizational ombudsman in mind the evaluation set out to research the mandate and the principles of operation of the ombudsman at who in order to design an adapted methodological approach
consistent with the approach of an organizational ombudsman the mandate of the who ombudsman is to the director general on corrective and preventive action in respect of the principles of independence neutrality impartiality confidentiality and
the ombudsman is ideally recourse of early resort not last resort and encourages early resolution of conflict and other employment related difficulties
the mandate of the ombudsman presents four mediate and facilitate conflict resolution related to wide range of staff issues and disputes that may emerge in the monitor trends in support of early detection of issues of potential significance at institutional level and advise on appropriate remedial and preventive support preventive action helping individuals managers teams and departments avoid preventable mistakes contribute to developing and strengthening workplace and culture that uphold the values of the organization its ethical and functional integrity respect for the dignity diversity and rights of staff in compliance with the rules and regulations and the code of conduct for international civil servants
the ombudsman is guided by professional standards which are based on the core principles of the international ombudsman association and its code of ethics and standards of practice
these principles include independence autonomy from administration and staff impartiality neutrality without bias or prejudice to any confidentiality all dealings in confidence external discussion only with explicit consent the only exception is where there appears to be imminent risk of serious harm informality an informal resource
journal of the international ombudsman association marie bomb in two related concepts that are key to the ombudsman function available to any staff members access is right for all staff re spec everyone treated with courtesy dignity and respect
access to the office of the ombudsmen is on voluntary basis and is not intended to discourage staff from using alternative channels
staff who visit the ombudsman have the choice to contact other channels within the organization as in mentioned below as well
methodological approach preliminary review of professional ombudsman literature showed that the issue of effectiveness which lies at the heart of professionalism raised particular complications for profession that has neutrality informality confidentiality and independence as core principles
the very nature of the ombudsman function carries inherent challenges in terms of developing objective indicators to measure outcomes and assess performance
the evaluation acknowledged these limitations to assessing the performance of the ombudsman and sought to identify meaningful indicators of effectiveness
the evaluation opted to address the limitations to developing methodology to assess the performance of an ombudsman function early on
evaluating effectiveness is challenging task ombudsman activities and case details are by nature confidential and gathering the views of staff on ombudsman functions is sensitive ombudsman operations engage with multiple stake holders representing different interests and multiple issues
therefore effectiveness should be assessed from variety of attributing given outcome to the ombudsman is difficult
ombudsmen do not make management decisions many of the of ombudsmen result from the actions of other people within the conflict resolution system in which the ombudsman operates
consequently it is difficult to collect objective data on the benefits or intangible costs of ombudsman interventions can lead to tangible as well as intangible benefits that are difficult to quantify eg positive externalities eg reduction of costs of conflict in terms of staff turnover productivity or psychological morbidity and work related sick measuring customer satisfaction is complex due to the volatile nature of end results achieved eg customer may be dissatisfied with the outcome of particular case yet the ombudsman may have done very good it is difficult to quantify the cost of the time spent by senior management and human resources legal officers on conflict resolution andor it is difficult to define when case reaches or it is difficult to assess the appropriate time needed to consider and case the relationship between the number of formal cases and the ombudsman involvement is not linear eg rather than reducing the number of formal cases the ombudsman role may lead to an increase in cases
journal of the international ombudsman association marie bomb in the evaluation found an emerging consensus in professional ombudsman literature that while is no single scientifically sound method to measure the cost effectiveness of an ombudsman it is possible to estimate some of the costs and benefits of adopting new conflict management system that includes an
statistics such as the evolution of the number of appeals of formal administration decisions the cost of appeals vs
cost of the ombudsman function or the sheer number of visitors in given period of time taken in isolation do not provide satisfactory indications of performance as such
the number of appeals can evolve independently of the outputs of any ombudsman
for instance high performing ombudsman may in fact incite people to appeal certain administrative decisions
this may lead to an increase in the number of appeals rather than decreasing the number of appeals as staff become more aware of conflict resolution mechanisms as result of the awareness raising efforts
moreover high performing ombudsman may have limited impact on the number of formal appeals in the face of major organizational change that results in administrative decisions geared towards restr uc tu rings or downsizing
finally the considerations that lead staff member to appeal decision or not are complex and may not be related to any piece of advice received
similarly the number of visitors seen by the ombudsman in given year does not in itself provide useful insights into the effectiveness of the function
if an ombudsman is perceived as not credible or partial or weak this will deter potential visitors who will seek alternative advice
the evaluation proceeded to research the indicators noted by professional ombudsmen and peer reviews as the most meaningful ways to assess the success of an ombudsman function
figure provides list of indicators of effectiveness figure indicators that can demonstrate internal assessment of the caseload statistics and analysis of numbers of cases issues trends and response time of the ombudsman
anonymous feedback from visitors or staff who have been in contact with the ombudsman
surfacing problems unknown to the organization or unrecognized
training and outreach to many stake holders
inclusion in climate surveys eg general analyses of morale conditions within an area of the organization responses to change identity free analysis from pooled exit interviews and assistance with degree per for man ce evaluations
specific notes about changes in policies procedures and structures in response to concerns that have come to the ombudsman
annual reports and web site materials
followup on most serious issues over time
identifying the ombudsman contribution and benefits and cost savings derived from specific major initiatives in the organization eg new policy change in procedures
source toa th annual conference journal of the international ombudsman association marie bomb in the author concluded that the most meaningful means to estimate the effectiveness of an ombudsman function resides in the analysis of trends over time eg comparing the evolution of the number of visitors over several years staff perceptions awareness of the mandate of the ombudsman level of information of staff on available recourses and mechanisms to solve issues and the extent to which the systemic problems identified by the ombudsman are addressed
this evaluation accordingly did not attempt to ea sure performance in the processing of individual quantify the out comes of the ombudsman office examine mea sur es to generate value proposition for the organization ss ess whether who achieves through the ombudsman any specific intended outcome
holistic approach impact of the organizational context the evaluation was mindful of the fact that ombudsman services are intricately rooted in the organizational context in which the ombudsman operates
in particular it recognized the fact that reform environment or an environment marked by restructuring or downsizing leading to staff separations could place additional demands on the ombudsman eg increasing caseload or give rise to cases of particular nature eg increasing number of formal appeals
similarly the evaluation sought to take holistic approach to the ombudsman role as an integral part of the organizational context in which it operates and considered structural changes reforms and policy developments that could influence the role of the ombudsman and vice versa
participation of stake holders the author chose an inclusive approach and to interact with all the stake holders of the internal conflict resolution mechanisms which typically include the legal human resources departments and the staff association as much as possible
to this end an management was established to peer review the evaluation
the was composed of two external peer ombudsmen who provided insight from their professional experience and three internal staff members in management positions who had knowledge of the internal dynamics of the organization both at headquarters and in the regional country offices
interested parties andor stake holders to the internal justice system in the organization were part of the
the reviewed the terms of reference the design of the all staff survey questionnaire see below for further details and provided comments on the draft report
the provided insights and suggestions throughout the exercise
acknowledging the limitations in assessing the effectiveness of profession that has neutrality informality confidentiality and independence as core principles the evaluation did not attempt to measure performance in the processing of individual cases
rather it focused on the indicators noted by professional ombudsmen and peer reviews to assess the success of an ombudsman function eg trend analysis general awareness levels training and outreach efforts contributions to policies and strategic development ability to surface systemic issues annual reporting and web site materials
journal of the international ombudsman association marie bomb in with this in mind the author decided to analyze effectiveness by assessing elev an ce of the ombudsman mandate and supporting policy of ombudsman processes management monitoring and reporting tools and on trib uti on of the ombudsman to organizational change
the evaluation used range of tools to collect both quantitative and qualitative information including review of professional ombudsman literature interviews with staff and external parties and an all staff survey
interviews the evaluation undertook large number of semi structured interviews with key staff worldwide and of peer ombudsmen in other multilateral organizations
all stake holders of the internal conflict resolution system were interviewed and many staff members volunteered their views
survey questionnaire an electronic survey was designed to gather perceptions from staff worldwide
the questionnaire was developed in consultation with the members the stake holders of the internal conflict resolution system as well as with the hq and regional ombudsmen
the survey included five sections to address general awareness of the ombudsman function ii personal experience of workplace related issue iii experience as the respondent of contact from the ombudsman iv perceptions of the ombudsman function and personal details which could be withheld
the evaluation focused on detected trends and patterns in comments rather than individual reflections
responses in the free text sections of the survey referring to specific individual cases and individual issues revealed in interviews were treated with due respect to their seriousness but for the purpose of analysis had to be considered anecdotal and served to inform the research
literature review the evaluation included review of relevant published literature internal documents and web sites including quantitative monitoring and reporting data from who internal and public sources
relevant literature on the ombudsman function was selected based on suggestions from professional ombudsmen
verification of information the information gathered was validated by verifying multiple data sources documents interviews and survey to develop consistent and objective analysis
in formulating the conclusions and recommendations the evaluation also took into account the general organizational context of reform and resource constraints
journal of the international ombudsman association marie bomb in relevance of the ombudsman mandate and supporting policy framework the evaluation assessed the mandate of the ombudsman and its positioning across the organization including regional and country offices
to review the validity of the ombudsman function the evaluation assessed the extent to which staff perceptions of the role and success of the ombudsman were met in practice and analysed the coherence of the ombudsman mandate both with mission and objectives and with professional ombudsman standards
staff perceptions of the ombudsman function were collected through survey which assessed of familiarity with the mandate and role of the understanding of staff of the ole of the ombudsman with questions designed to delineate staff expectations of the ombudsman as provider of mediation services informal fact finding an opportunity to address conflicts early before they develop into crisis an alternative to formal internal justice mechanisms an off the record resource independent advice confidential environment impartial understanding of staff of the ar of competencies of the ombudsman ie relationships and conflicts in the workplace policies procedures ethics and standards administrative contractual matters performance appraisals career development recruitment selection procedures and special leave work life balance er cep ti on of staff of the areas where the role has been instrumental ie promo ti on of equal treatment of all staff promotion of ethical principles and conduct of staff sending strong message that the organization wants to address workplace related issues fostering respectful workplace environment and building trust
to examine the coherence of the ombudsman role with the policies rules and regulations the evaluation reviewed the policy framework in which the ombudsman operates
the evaluation analysed strengths and weaknesses and identified policy gaps as well as unimplemented policy areas ie where existing policies have not been ope rationalized or translated into management practices systematically through the adoption of adequate tools to stimulate and support change
it also reviewed the contribution of the ombudsman to the development of the policy framework and the incentives provided by existing policies ie harassment whistle blower mediation to favour informal conflict resolution mechanisms vs
the evaluation reviewed the organizational positioning of the ombudsman in the organization in relation to ombudsman principles with particular attention to independence and accessibility to ombudsman services worldwide
who is decentralized organization with six regional offices and country offices
the evaluation therefore assessed the coverage of all the offices the level of staff awareness of the possibility to access ombudsman services in different locations the ombudsman recruitment process the ombudsman terms of reference and administrative reporting lines within the administration
journal of the international ombudsman association marie bomb in the ombudsman within the corporate conflict resolution mechanism the evaluation assessed the relationship of the ombudsman with the corporate internal justice system and examined collaboration with the departments involved
corporate conflict resolution system addressing workplace related conflicts requires the simultaneous intervention of multiple actors

figure outlines the characteristics of an effective dispute resolution system figure characteristics of effective internal dispute resolution the system is taken seriously strong support from top management widely publicized training reports meaningful statistics
the system provides significant evidence of change as result of complaints and disputes including reversal of some management decisions
policies against retaliation are taken seriously by all managers are not sanctioned for reversing decisions in good faith employees are not punished for raising questions for reasonable disputing
the system provides options and choice for pursuing most complaints
the system provides loops back from adjudicative options to problem solving options and also loops forward so that most people with problems can at any stage choose investigation and adjudication of their complaints so long as they do so in good faith
the system is available to everyone
the system provides in house designated neutrals
the system provides if possible more than one available neutral
the system guarantees confidentiality except in the rare case where there is duty to protect ie danger to self or others
source mary ro we negotiation journal the ombudsman alone cannot be held accountable for fostering an environment that helps resolve disputes informally
the evaluation assessed the extent to which the ombudsman at who had formalized relations with other departments such as through regular meetings and information exchanges
considering that holistic approach including all the departments involved in internal dispute resolution mechanisms was warranted to establish corporate conflict resolution system it assessed the extent to which the ombudsman had contributed to developing joint work practices
to this end the evaluation assessed the awareness of staff of the respective roles and responsibilities of the different stake holders of workplace related conflict resolution mechanism
it also reviewed how information was made available on the different resources available to staff within the organization to settle conflict
the evaluation reviewed the information provided on the intranet ie the different options and processes available to staff to seek solution and the roles and responsibilities of the different stake holders of the conflict resolution mechanisms
this is key to providing guidance to staff who may be faced with variety of issues and sometimes receive conflicting advice on to go
journal of the international ombudsman association marie bomb in interaction with the departments involved in conflict resolution staff need guidance on the alternative options available to them when facing issues in the workplace
the evaluation interviewed representatives from the other offices involved in conflict management processes and the staff association to identify the areas where closer collaboration with the ombudsman was warranted in particular to enhance communication and information exchanges beyond individual cases eg on who human resources workplace and conflict management related strategies policies standard operating procedures analysis of trends as well as statistical analysis and reporting of cases categories of issues and risks
ombudsman and formal processes the relationship between ombudsman performance and the number of formal cases is not linear
it is difficult to find objective indicators to assess the usefulness of ombudsmen in avoiding or stopping formal processes
the evaluation also factored in the need to consider internal organizational developments which may introduce biases in documenting the relationship between the performance of an ombudsman and formal processes ie the number of formal processes may increase and yet ombudsman may be highly effective as some staff may arguably seek formal appeal mechanisms anyway
this evaluation did not attempt to assess the effectiveness of the ombudsman in terms of avoiding formal processes
rather it analyzed the extent to which formal cases that are withdrawn suspended or settled before their conclusion could have benefited from greater ombudsman involvement from the point of view of reaching an earlier informal resolution
according to the management review of the appeals process undertaken by the office of internal oversight services at the united nations approximately of appeals submitted between and were either withdrawn or settled
this reveals potential to reduce the time and cost of managing the appeal process through stronger emphasis on prevention and informal resolution figure
figure cost of appeals withdrawals and settlements the staff members involved in managing the appeals process often spend considerable time and effort even at this late stage in trying to reconcile the parties and finding non adversarial solutions
the cost of prevention is hard to measure yet it is an essential component of the process
many of these preventive measures remain undocumented but some can be traced
found that roughly percent of the appeals submitted in new york from to were either withdrawn or settled before formal joint appeals board report was prepared many reports submitted after that time are still in the pipeline
other duty stations showed similar pattern
quantifying and costing the time spent on actual appeals proved difficult if not impossible
source un office of internal oversight services management review of the appeal process un similarly the evaluation found that sizeable proportion of formal complaints filed for investigation with relevant services were in fact resolved early before formal investigation process was launched
in the view such pieces of information provide an indication as to whether informal processes and mediation could have bigger role upstream in avoiding unnecessary escalation to formal solutions which are time consuming and costly in financial and human terms for both complainants and complaint subjects
journal of the international ombudsman association marie bomb in ombudsman networks in profession characterized by certain level of isolation and exposed to ethical dilemmas where good judgment needs to be exercised on regular basis participating in professional fora is key to keeping abreast of developments in the field and obtaining insights from peers
self reflection and evaluation are important aspects of the ombudsman work and difficult without sharing in forma ti on among peers
the evaluation assessed the extent to which the ombudsman kept abreast of professional developments eg through close collaboration and engagement with the international ombudsman association and the annual and regular meetings of the network of ombudsmen from the un and related international organizations
efficiency and adherence to principles efficiency is measure of how economically resources and inputs are converted into results
the evaluation assessed the extent to which the ombudsman function is structured to optimize outputs supported by adequate levels of resources and adequate processes and tools
it analysed the main concrete output the annual report from the perspective of meaningful potential communication and advocacy tool
the evaluation reviewed the level and use of resources of the ombudsman function to the ade qu ac of the terms of reference and skill set of the ombudsman with particular emphasis on management and training and mediation the of the ombudsman case workload with prevention and trend analysis act iv
according to estimations shared with the evaluation by peer ombudsmen the adequate yearly maximum case load for an ombudsman is informally estimated to be around cases
high caseload makes it difficult for one ombudsman to fully address the areas of prevention mediation and coordinate the regional and country levels adequately the en deployment of ombudsman services worldwide across the organization the vail ability of mediation capacity across the organization
the evaluation analysed the tools developed by the ombudsman to manage individual cases and to follow up across the organization with view to assessing the performance of the ombudsman monitoring system to provide global overview of the types of issues that surface worldwide
managing and monitoring individual cases is key prerequisite for the analysis and identification of trends and systemic issues
the evaluation reviewed the case management system of the ombudsman and the information captured about individual cases ie typology of cases time elapsed between contacts and the outcomes achieved
the evaluation noted that tracking the status of cases is not simple task
particular issues involved the definition of of interactions with the ombudsman and of when case can be considered closed or concluded and the need to keep track of cases referred to other departments in consultation with them while maintaining confidentiality
journal of the international ombudsman association marie bomb in the evaluation also took note of the fact that the ombudsman does not function in vacuum but in the wider framework of the organization
accordingly it also raised the need for the ombudsman to develop work plan with objectives strategy plan and budget to demonstrate its value and accountability
the evaluation considered the ombudsman annual report in the light of comparative analysis of the annual reports over time and the reports of other international organizations
it assessed how the report was used strategically as communication tool that serves the purpose of demonstrating the added value raising staff awareness across the organization or as means to take stock of ombudsman interventions and of limitations in terms of making decisions
this would be instrumental in increasing the visibility of the function communicating the business case for the ombudsman across the organization and ultimately serving as vehicle to advocate change
the review of ombudsman reports over time provided useful insights on how to standardize annual ombudsman reports for more meaningful content including in particular more in depth analysis ombudsman out comes such as and with breakdown of referrals to different services om pari sons and trends over time going back several years and across the organization including all regions countries and elation ship of the ombudsman with the internal informal conflict resolution or relation with formal visit feedback with an analysis of the evolution of staff perceptions through comparison of the feedback received over period of time
such an analysis would provide essential information to the ombudsman to self evaluate the services provided and calibrate upcoming outreach and awareness raising tr ain ing and outreach activities ol low up on the recommendations made in previous years risk cat of cases
the evaluation assessed the ombudsman operations in the light of the ombudsman principles
particular attention was given to the principle of confidentiality which was interpreted in the context of an organizational ombudsman mandate ie applied strictly to individual cases but not preempting collaboration within the informal conflict resolution system eg policy development procedures training and outreach activities
credibility and the relationship to senior management are key to the success of an ombudsman
the interpretation of confidentiality according to ombudsman principles confidentiality is owned by the complainant who consulted the ombudsman not by the ombudsman
with the exception of cases of imminent danger or serious harm the ombudsman can only waive confidentiality to discuss an issue with the explicit consent of the complainant
journal of the international ombudsman association marie bomb in at the same time confidentiality does not entail culture of secrecy
while there is firm understanding among stake holders of conflict management mechanisms who in several cases are themselves also held to confidentiality that this principle should be applied rigorously to individual cases there is also need for greater discernment of the organizational realities and the need for interaction with other departments to discuss wide range of issues that impact on dispute resolution mechanisms
the evaluation was sensitive to the fact that the principle of confidentiality should not be upheld to preclude generic discussions eg on case numbers issue types trends and preclude dialogue on strategic policy or procedural issues of common interest eg establishing adequate conflict management ethical training institutionalizing respectful workplace approach reviewing the implementation of staff rules and regulations
common positions of the different departments involved in these issues can greatly enhance the coherence and visibility of the mechanisms and commitment to resolve conflicts and create the critical mass necessary to implement cultural change
the concept of due process the evaluation looked at the concept of due process in association with the principles of due diligence and impartiality
due diligence is not principle recognized by professional ombudsman associations
ombudsmen refer to fact finding to highlight the difference with formal processes that result in decisions
as opposed to the classical ombudsman who carries out investigations the organizational ombudsman functions informally
while classical ombudsmen need to adhere to principle of review as spelled out in the governmental standards of the united states ombudsman association the organizational ombudsman is required to collect as much information to support informal resolution of conflict as appropriate and necessary
the lack of clearer standards of practice or operating principles to reassure external parties that the organizational ombudsman acts within professional parameters constitutes weakness in the sense that it leaves the responsibility to conduct fact finding research to the good judgment of the individual ombudsman
this may make the ombudsman vulnerable to perceptions of partiality eg making unfounded recommendations spreading unfounded rumors
eliminating this ambiguity would require elaborating due diligence standards of practice
particularly with regards to situations where there may be perception of conflict of interest the ombudsman needs standard operating procedures to guide professional conduct towards the complainant the subject of the complaint and the administration
according to the definition of the principles of neutrality and impartiality used by the the organizational ombudsman for impartiality fairness and objectivity in the treatment of people and the consideration of issues
the ombudsman advocates for fair and equitably administered processes and does not advocate on behalf of any individual within the
this does not equate to the principle of due process applicable to adversarial conflict resolution systems which involves ensuring that sides to dispute deserve fair opportunity to be heard an opportunity to fully respond to complaint made by the reasonable notice to the parties affected by complaint and allowing fair length of time for individuals to prepare andor respond and clearly defined unbiased reasons for decisions
journal of the international ombudsman association marie bomb in one of the major benefits of the ombudsman is its ability to tailor responses and dispute resolution mechanisms to the particular circumstances of each case do not deliver in the sense of court system
they encourage practices that are fair and just and respectful
they work to foster whatever responsible process is under the in the ideal situation this process is one chosen or at least agreed to by the
there is practical dichotomy between the concept of due process and confidentiality for ombudsmen which may put them in difficult position
an ombudsman may only escalate issues with the explicit agreement of the visitor
as most cases involve relationships with managers an ombudsman can only sensitize the visitor to approaching the before escalating an issue
however the ombudsman may find himself herself in situation where he she should report an issue concerning process or manager which may have been addressed to him her in confidence by more than one staff member thereby creating pattern that is within his her remit to bring to the attention of management
avoiding such situations by finding indirect ways to inform the subject of complaint that there is an issue while maintaining confidentiality and seeking to validate information received from the visitor may require creativity
this can go beyond the ombudsman responsibility which is primarily to seek an informal solution
while good practice is to foster communication and encourage staff to discuss their issues directly in first instance escalating issues to reach settlement while maintaining confidentiality is ultimately left to the discretion and tact of the ombudsman
the relationship of the ombudsman with senior management is crucial to pre empt perceptions of favoritism and partiality on the part of the ombudsman
the evaluation therefore reviewed the collaboration of the ombudsman with senior management to cover general trends and management issues
the ombudsman credibility is essential to ensure that the ombudsman can rely on the trust and goodwill of senior management and foster their renewed commitment to demonstrate zero tolerance to bullying harassment and other unacceptable behaviors
contribution to organizational change to assess effectiveness the evaluation questioned the extent to which the ombudsman had contributed to organizational change
for this purpose the evaluation analyzed the prevention activities of the ombudsman and sought to determine how it impacted on the wider culture of the organization
prevention and the cost of psychological morbidity the author noted that too narrow focus on the cost of appeals could draw attention away from prevention and found that more meaningful indicator of prevention efforts could include statistics on the cost of psychological morbidity measured for example by work related sick leave
while appreciating the sensitivity of such data the evaluation believes that an analysis of such statistics could be useful tool
with the right safeguards it could provide powerful indicator of trends and staff morale
journal of the international ombudsman association marie bomb in training and outreach sustained training and outreach efforts are critical to convey message about the ombudsman function as recourse of early resort and impact on an culture
while the ombudsman on its own is not responsible for the wide range of prevention activities that should form the basis of successful approach to conflict its role is critical
training and outreach are also of crucial importance for the ombudsman to promote its values mission and services as an agent of change that can help staff solve their problems successfully
the evaluation reviewed peer ombudsmen advocacy best practices such as all staff meetings to present the annual ombudsman report and intermediate debriefings with information on visitor trends by issue type and cluster
such meetings provide information on the ombudsman mandate professional principles and promote culture of transparency
the evaluation assessed the extent to which the ombudsman had conducted such activities to reinforce staff awareness of the ombudsman function prerequisite if the ombudsman is to act as recourse of early resort
another measure of awareness that the evaluation considered is the inclusion of the ombudsman function in perception surveys
the quality of the monitoring of individual cases and of the information presented in the ombudsman reports as well as the followup on previous recommendations are critical elements to assess the usefulness of the information shared by the ombudsman over time
analysis of systemic issues and early warn inga key duty of an organizational ombudsman is to bring systemic concerns to the attention of the organization for resolution
for the ombudsman the ability to escalate issues for action by senior management is in direct proportion to the credibility
it is intricately linked to the personal credibility of the incumbent and to the institutional credibility granted by the organization
credibility is the main driver of the reputation
close link to and regular communication with the head of the organization are crucial to the effectiveness of the ombudsman function
the nature of the link relies on trust and depends both on the demonstrated personal credibility and on institutional credibility supported by senior visible backing of the prevention efforts
the ombudsman function requires institutional clout to ensure credibility in the form of demonstrated independence and means to carry out its duties
role in cultural change the evaluation was conscious of the perception from the general public that the ombudsman function should contribute to avoiding formal processes eg appeals against administrative decisions harassment complaints
such perceptions are backed by sense that if problem is serious enough people will appeal
so formal processes tend to be seen as the most effective way to demonstrate the seriousness of case and to be heard
this undermines the conflict prevention role of the ombudsman ie create workplace more conducive to efficient performance and minimize the cost of psychological morbidity in the organization
such perceptions shape culture that is not supportive of conflict prevention efforts or informal resolution of disputes
figure shows how an ombudsman can contribute to organizational change
journal of the international ombudsman association marie bomb in figure the ombudsman and organizational change the ombudsman provides early warning by identifying or areas needing managerial intervention
statistics provided by the ombudsman function can result in periodic recommendations concerning organizational change that might benefit the enterprise as whole
this can resolve contentious issues early and can prevent their re currance
source mc bride associates culture change is needed to shift the focus on appeals towards the benefits business case of achieving characterized by transparency the ability to voice issues and resolve them and enhanced staff acceptance of change
figure attempts to provide definition of an organizational culture
figure what is the culture of an org ani zati ona definition of an culture is people treat each
and how people treat each other when in conflict is its essence
thus shifting an attitudes and practices around conflict can fundamentally and positively affect the workplace and its culture
source journal of the international ombudsman assoc ia ti ona strong and consistent message is needed to modify this perception over time and convey the commitment to workplace where issues can be voiced heard and discussed without fear of reprisals
culture change in an organization is complex process involving multiple actors and the role can only be limited
while it would be preposterous to seek to attribute culture change to an individual ombudsman the ombudsman can make significant contribution towards change
the tools of the ombudsman are the analysis of cases of trends the knowledge of emerging issues that can be instrumental in departing from culture of secrecy to workplace where issues can be voiced and heard and solutions sought in good faith
implementing the recommendations made in the annual ombudsman reports or presenting meaningful data on trends across the organization and over time such as for example statistics on visitor numbers with case typologies can be instrumental in bringing about change
studies of the psychosocial environment at work show that management and coworker support rewards development opportunities and trust are the main mitigation factors of psychosocial risks
while formulating the body of strategies needed to ensure systematic implementation of the policies and research on workplace related stress is clearly beyond the remit the ombudsman can contribute to cultural change in meaningful way mission of the organizational ombudsman is to provide confidential neutral and informal process which facilitates fair and equitable resolutions to concerns that arise in the organization
in performing this mission the ombudsman serves as an information and communication resource upward feedback channel advisor dispute resolution expert and change
journal of the international ombudsman association marie bomb inconclusion in conclusion evaluating the effectiveness of an ombudsman function is an enriching experience with wide ranging lessons
it demonstrates that the ombudsman function is largely dependent on the personal credibility of the incumbent and on the institutional credibility warranted by senior management
this entails particular challenge to focus on the ombudsman function rather than its incumbent and relate ombudsman operations to the organizational context in which they take place
in this sense analyzing perceptions and trends through comprehensive interviews and using survey instruments enabled the evaluation to gather information on the prevailing culture of the organization with regards to conflict resolution
it was critical to involve all staff across the organization covering all grades and geographical locations to take due account of the decentralized nature of organizational structures
another challenge was to analyze how an organizational ombudsman can serve as catalytic agent of change while recognizing that having an impact on the corporate culture of complex international organization with decentralized structures is well beyond the remit of the sole ombudsman
the approach chosen to look at the ombudsman function in holistic manner as part of an organization wide conflict resolution system that can bring about such expectations entailed extensive discussions with the different stake holders of the internal conflict resolution mechanism and senior managers
it also involved an in depth analysis of the awareness raising communication and training activities and more particularly of the use of the ombudsman annual report as strategic communication tool
as conclusion the evaluation showed that the positioning of the ombudsman within the organization its relationships with the wider internal conflict resolution system and with senior management are critical elements that drive the institutional credibility
the issue of credibility of the organizational ombudsman raised wider ranging questions for the ombudsman profession
the absence of practice manual or operational standards to implement professional principles can make the organizational ombudsman particularly vulnerable to perceptions of partiality
the has not developed standard operating procedures along the lines of classical mostly governmental ombudsman associations such as the united states ombudsman association which have different significantly more formal mandate as they typically undertake investigations
however there is scope for standardizing ombudsman practices in full respect of the of the ombudsman office
additionally developing standard practices in the framework of conflict resolution mechanism that includes all the departments of an organization that are involved would greatly contribute to clarifying the options open to staff who encounter work related difficulties and ope rationalize the principles

ombudsman research standards of practice influence academic ombudsmen
introduction in his article alan lincoln outlined research agenda for the
he cited lack of field research as one of the main reasons for putting forth this agenda
this article is summary of the doctoral research conducted in early exploring the characteristics of practice of organizational ombudsmen
the goals of this research were to understand and provide comprehensive definition of the organizational ombudsman identify characteristics of ombudsman practice during the options and actions stage identify commonalities among ombudsman practice during the options and actions stage develop theoretical model to explain the commonalities and differences identified and develop and report new information about the role to inform the practice of organizational ombudsmen
the data analysis resulted in grounded theory of the influences of organizational ombudsman practice
journal of the international ombudsman association lisa explored how organizational ombudsmen define and practice their role
sought to identify whether or not there are distinct categories or styles of organizational ombudsmen and if there are define and label them
sought to answer the following research questions what ar the characteristics of the option generating stage of organizational ombudsman practice
ar there commonalities and differences among organizational practice during the option generating stage and if so what are they
what in flu enc es an organizational practice during the option generating stage
to ground my project in the literature reviewed literature from both mediation and organization al ombudsman practices
was particularly interested in the mediation literature which focused on styles of mediation practice
reviewed articles by kr es sel risk in herr man ko lb cobb cobb and him mel stein and friedman and monk and win slade
discovered handful of theses and dis serta ti ons but relatively few scholarly research articles focusing on organizational ombudsmen
methodology based on strauss and cor bin cres well and gl as er and stra us grounded theory was the most appropriate research method because sought to understand and develop theory that explains the reasoning behind behavior or actions for which there is little research or theory to support the actions
cres well defined grounded theory as process that can or discover theory an abstract analytical schema of
participants in the study would all have experienced the process and the development of the theory might help explain practice or provide framework for further
this research met the criteria outlined by cres well because sought to understand the practice of organizational ombudsmen and there was little to no prior research
conducted survey of us academic organizational ombudsmen and invited survey participants to engage in followup interview
examined organizational charters and annual reports to learn how the organizational ombudsmen structure their office and how they communicate with the organizations within which they practice
seventeen participants were recruited from the academic sector of ombudsman offices as defined by the international ombudsman association
because this was the first study of understanding the characteristics of ombudsman practice participants were limited to single sector within single geographical location the united states to limit the number of variables
included ombudsmen with varying levels of experience as well as educational and professional experience and varying types of institutions to account for the potential impact these factors may have in how ombudsmen practice
in the spring of interviewed organizational ombudsmen via telephone for an average of minutes transcribed the interviews and analyzed the data using qualitative analysis software
fifteen of the organizational ombudsmen also completed an online anonymous survey that included information about educational and professional backgrounds as well as general information about the structure of their offices and demographic information about their organizations size public private
journal of the international ombudsman association lisa the data analysis methodology of both strauss and cor bin and hu berm an and miles as described by cres well data was coded in several rounds with each round refining the previous round and using finer combing of the broad categories of the previous round
this method of coding allowed for increased refinement of patterns
data were coded in three rounds of coding open axial and selective
open coding consists of generating categories from the data and then identifying subcategories cres well
axial coding involves using the same data that was coded in open coding and seeking to identify patterns or that connect the categories cres well
selective coding integrated the categories into story line as the theory begins to formulate strauss and cor bin
the first round of coding elicited the following eight categories of data interpretation and ope rationalization of standards of practice sops non sop influence on practice st meeting logistics getting the story building rapport generating options evaluating options next steps actions and engagement with the organization
these eight categories were further refined during subsequent rounds of coding to the following four categories that formed the basis of the theory generated interpretation and ope rationalization of sops non sop influences on practice engagement with the visitor and engagement with the organization
the final stage of the data analysis involved asking questions of the data such as one or two phenomena connect all of the categories
and there singular category that could be used to describe all of the other categories
beauty of grounded theory research is that the data drives the direction of the research and the data led me to the influences on an organizational practice
discovered the common thread linking the data categories was the interpretation and ope rationalization of the standards of practice
this common thread formed the basis of the theory of influences on us academic organizational practice
the standards of practice influenced not only how an ombudsman interacts with single visitor but also how they engage with the leadership and the organizational system as whole
the theory that emerged from the data was the practice of organizational ombudsmen is influenced by the three types of influences self organization and the interpretation and ope rationalization of the standards of practice
the self refers to the organizational ombudsman as an individual and the influences that are unique to the individual such as their educational background life experiences including career experience trainings ombudsman mediation other professional training mentorship relationships with other ombudsmen and personal philosophies such as desire to promote justice or fairness
the organization refers to the organization within which the ombudsmen practice including the culture of the organization the structure of the office and the expectations and boundaries or terms imposed upon by the organization or negotiated between the ombudsman and the organization
the standards of practice refers to how the ombudsman interprets and ope rationalizes or puts into practice the four standards of practice confidentiality neutrality impartiality informality and independence
the figure below graphically represents the theory
the characteristics of practice include elements of meeting with visitor as well as how an organizational ombudsman engages with the organization
each of the three influences as well as some of the characteristics of practice are described further in the subsequent sections
as the research evolved it became clear that the standards of practice were the preeminent influence in how an ombudsman practices
this sentiment was shared by all participants
however how each ombudsman interpreted and ope rationalized each standard varied from participant to participant
the standard of confidentiality was described by several ombudsmen as the most clearly defined standard and easiest to clearly interpret
one example from participant described the standard succinctly have that much trouble with confidentiality and knew what that
for several they described confidentiality as heart and soul of the and is what makes their office unique within their organization
one ombudsman described an office policy of not using email to communicate with visitors because confidentiality cannot be assured over email
an interesting aspect of confidentiality is why and how an ombudsman might choose to breach confidentiality
every single ombudsman described one reason for breaching confidentiality based on the standards of practice was an risk of serious standards of practice
there were some differences between the ombudsmen in their interpretation of this phrase
for some ombudsmen this phrase is defined by their organization while others have defined this phrase independent from their organization
one ombudsman whose organization defines imminent risk of serious harm for them said is determined as physical in my office although know other offices have more broad definition and the standards themselves do not define physical but been defined in my office and felt the need to change it
nice bright line or relatively nice bright line
another ombudsman described how she addresses confidentiality in her his opening statement by explaining confidentiality and then explaining these reasons she would not be able to keep information confidential if the visitor gives permission to speak with another person the journal of the international ombudsman association lisa cannot guarantee the other person will keep the conversation confidential imminent risk of serious harm if the ombudsman receives court order or subpoena because there are no statues that protect the confidentiality or privilege of communication with the office
another ombudsman raised the issue of being subpoenaed and indicated that they would explain to the visitor that the ombudsman would position against that if
there were several examples of how the participants interpret and define neutrality for their practice
one ombudsman provided an example of how particular interaction with visitor might be interpreted by colleagues as straying from the neutrality principle
she shared the following account she had with visitor who felt like no one in her university cared whether or not she completed her training and said to her talk to this person
they will tell you that they care that they want you to finish and important to and said care that you graduate
hope that you get through this and hope that you followup with and think some people feel like neutrality means you express personal concern about someone or an issue and disagree with that
think was taking sides between individuals at that time
think that it was small thing that had big impact and think we be afraid to do
two other ombudsmen also described how they interpret neutrality impartiality
in terms of the neutrality and impartiality it does not mean that have no opinions about anything and it does not mean that will not express my opinion about something
it means that will not act the way an attorney for the university or for the individual or union steward or an advocate will act
the second ombudsman described her his interpretation of the standard of neutrality impartiality and how this impacts how the ombudsman schedules meetings take it as an issue of part of the neutrality of the practice is to give everybody one
several of the ombudsmen described this standard in terms of multi partiality which is term commonly used in the mediation field think in practice that really what doing is more
three of the ombudsmen described multi partiality as an explicit influence in how they interpret and define the neutrality impartiality standard in their practice
many of the ombudsmen described how they interpret informality in terms of what they will not do as opposed to what they will do
an example of this comes from one particularly pithy ombudsman if you are operating in an informal capacity as opposed to formal one you definitely have any business being in grievance
many of the ombudsmen described how they will not participate in formal process
some of the ombudsmen reported boundary set by their organization that requires the ombudsman to cease working with an individual once the visitor enters formal process
others reported that this was boundary they had instituted in their own practice as part of informality
one such example is general counsel stopped me from talking to somebody although the longer do this begin to think generally best practice once they have someone on the outside such as an
journal of the international ombudsman association lisa ombudsmen described willingness to work with visitor if the administrators of the formal process agreed to hold that process
other ombudsmen noted that one of the lessons they had learned over the years was to be open to working with visitors with legal representation
finally some ombudsmen described willingness to work with visitor regardless of their formal complaints but that the ombudsman would no longer be able to contact anyone else regarding the situation and the role would switch to coaching about the process tell them that directly get involved but maybe some information behind the scenes that can help you
another ombudsman described her his role in the formal process as more of an emphasis on how the process is going not the outcome the process or procedure of formal investigation is going that will get involved in because to me not the formal process itself involved in how the process is running and separate
more than one ombudsman interprets the informality standard as their guidance for not engaging in investigatory work on behalf of the organization
for many of the participants the standard of independence was not primary standard and was often described lastly
one respondent stated never had that much trouble with operating independently because we do that
nobody was asking us who did you see and what did they tell you
the differences between the ombudsmen in their interpretation of this standard can be described by answering the question is the ombudsman independent from
some of the participants described independence from influence from leadership while others described independence as not only from the organization and the hierarchy but also from the individual visitors
an example of this was provided by multiple ombudsmen one quote from participant illustrates this om buds independence in making determinations that they are not to be directed by hr or even directed by the visitors themselves to take particular course of
another ombudsman describes how they practice independently in terms of not being influenced by individuals particularly around raising issues know sometimes people may try to influence you to do what they want or not to raise an issue or administrators will try to sweep things under the rug and feel like have to play along just because work
many of the ombudsmen interpreted independence to mean they should to the highest level within the
one ombudsman indicated how the standard of independence has influenced her his practice in terms of the reporting relationship it was later elevated and we adopted standards but had this historical reporting relationship that is lower in the organization and think that influences the way we work
we have direct line of communication to the chief executive officer or to the chancellor so that impacts our ability to be change agent for the organization
another participant interprets informality and independence as operationally the same standard well if you are operating in an informal capacity as opposed to formal one you definitely have any business being in grievance hearing
an ombudsman colleague would say and agree that independence
our colleague would say that about independence
we are not to be confused with the formal process or existing administrative processes we are independent of that but it really clear when first began practicing
journal of the international ombudsman association lisa ombudsman interprets her his independence in terms of her his ability to be creative as long as she is not breaking any laws or policy long as color inside the lines of law and policy have the liberty to be fairly
finally one ombudsman refers to presentation given by john st on bark at at the annual conference in where bark at asserted that for ombudsmen to be valuable and effective within their organizations they must challenge the more conservative notion of independence and be more engaged within the organization
several of the ombudsmen began by describing the standard of practice of independence as somewhat easy standard to interpret however as many continued in their responses the standard of independence did not seem to be as universally defined and ope rationalized
more than one ombudsman described how they participate on task forces as long as their role is more of consultant than full participant
one ombudsman described how she also sits in on regular university wide leadership group meeting sit in on any decision making if any matters about individuals leave the room so really been careful how my role is framed and that it show up in any formal
ombudsmen who described serving on committee or task force described this aspect of their practice as important for being in tune with the current issues and culture of the organization
these aspects of practice are in line with the discussion above of the independence standard of practice and the presentation by bark at in
more than one ombudsman reports attending senate faculty student or staff senate meetings to stay informed about current issues within the organization as well as contributing to newsletters or blo gs within their universities
however more than one ombudsman also expressed concern with participating in similar meetings because of the perception that the ombudsman would be considered less independent
from ombudsmen reported aspects of their practice which they know to be in contradiction with or deviations from the four standards of practice
the choice to use this diction to describe the subcategory came directly from participant who described an aspect of her his practice as deviation from the standards of
some of the ombudsmen described these explicitly as deviation from the standards while others described these aspects of their practice when discussing the standards of practice in general or how the standards are ope rationalized
more than one ombudsman reported concern for the perception of not adhering to the standards of practice which could have implications on the security of their position or office within the organization as well as perceptions of their ombudsmen colleagues
an ombudsman described how she believes that the standards are actually misinterpreted by ombudsmen
she recalled plenary session at an annual conference where an ombudsman stood up during the question and answer portion and stated that the ombudsman cannot put their organization on notice
according to the ombudsman participant this is misinterpretation of the standard and that the key is that an ombudsman cannot receive notice but there is nothing that states an ombudsman cannot put the organization on notice
see sop for the direct standard the ombudsman is referring to
more than one ombudsman reported that they have and frequently put their university on notice
for example several ombudsmen provided examples for when they will put their university on notice
one common example involved sexual harassment and sexual assault
one ombudsman describes this in terms of her his informality journal of the international ombudsman association lisa another example for informality would be if real issue for me is sexual harassment and sexual assault and if have student come in to me and say want to report it but want you there
really not supposed to do that because then part of putting the university on notice but going to do it
it really is more important to me that that student get that support and if the only game in town well will explore other options to say we get you an advocate
there are all these but if the student says trust you and need you will do it
being very honest with you there are times when going to
not sure that pure but trying to have higher principles in mind that guide me as making those interpretations
two of the participants reported holding an additional position within the university in conjunction with the role as an ombudsman
the standards of practice state ombudsman serves in no additional role within the organization which would compromise the international ombudsman association
this is sensitive issue and several ombudsmen acknowledged this and added that either they or colleagues they know to be in this situation would rather not have dual role
several ombudsmen acknowledged this was not an ideal structure for the office and would change it if they could however they also believed that their structure was better than the alternative which was no ombudsman office
one ombudsman described scene she witnessed at an ombudsman conference that summarizes her own views on the standards of practice this one guy got up and said know this is all well and good you know you have your standards and and he said be so good that good for and thought that is so great because you the playbook has to be put down
you got to put it down and not in the playbook so then got to do something else and be ready to abandon the standard things and go for something else because you need something else
several of the ombudsmen reported stigma or lack of support for raising differences in adherence to the standards of practice
for example one participant re porte di think what is particularly painful for me about the field is that we create safe places to talk to our colleagues about these things so doing it because there is such stigma about not adhering to those standards of practice and also certified om buds
this issue of to discuss the standards of practice was mentioned by several other ombudsmen in this study and is something that has become more prevalent and perhaps more challenging with the creation of the certification program
the participant quoted above indicated that she is certified ombudsman practitioner and discussions about how an ombudsman practices could have implications for standing in the ombudsman certification program as well as how the organization perceives the practice
the non sop influences on ombudsman practice that participants described reminded me of the pe cha presentations from the past several conferences
this particular category provided the most personal window into an practice
found all of the ombudsmen to journal of the international ombudsman association lisa incredibly reflective and several ombudsmen expressed form of that these questions provided them
many of the ombudsmen described deeply personal life experiences that have influenced how they practice
some included personal tragedies that have provided the ombudsman with deeper level of empathy for their visitors
many described other academic disciplines and professional backgrounds that have informed their practice
several of the ombudsmen with legal training indicated that this training has provided the grounding for asking good questions to elicit information from visitor
many of the ombudsmen with mental health or social work backgrounds described the challenges of shifting from advocate to neutral
an additional influence several ombudsmen reported were personal philosophies
for example three of the participants referenced being influenced by principles such as sense of justice or peace
one ombudsman described this as think strong foundation and philosophical belief in social justice and think broadly
other ombudsmen referred to literature in broad scope of topics ranging from neuroscience to religion to psychology to negotiation to mental health literature
two of the ombudsmen described their practice as being influenced by the person centered approach to human interaction
these two ombudsmen had previous professional experience in the field of social work
the ombudsmen also reported additional influences on their practice including their education training and previous professional experience
the ombudsmen reported variety of graduate degree experience
the graphs below depict educational background certification status and formal ombudsman training of participants
journal of the international ombudsman association lisa ombudsman reported that her his frustration with the formal processes in her his institution led to an interest in alternative ways of resolving issues and ultimately her his interest in the ombudsman role so for me one of the driving things about how run this is am firmly committed to this informal way on grounds that we badly need it because within our world the formal systems produce results but people have to go back and work with each other
and come with firm commitment that even if the informal ways are messy and ill defined know what happens when you have them and so find myself committed to explore and experiment and try to make it work
now not exactly technique but for me an influence that keeps me wanting to experiment with alternate ways of getting the job done informally
and also think what motivates my focus on empowering people to make their own decisions
all but two of the ombudsmen reported relationships with other ombudsmen as having an influence on their practice
these relationships ranged from mentorship to informal regional ombudsmen groups to membership in professional ombudsman associations
two of the ombudsmen reported that they had been influenced by their canadian ombudsman emphasis on fairness
many ombudsmen reported that the relationships with other ombudsmen have not only been influential on their practice but instrumental in the development of their practice
this was particularly true for the ombudsmen who began practicing before the standards of practice were developed
one ombudsman reported that her his conversations at ombudsmen gatherings meetings and informal conversations shaped her his practice early on because there was not much guidance when she first began practicing know if you have enough support and respect for the people you are talking to you can do wonderful things with
the data revealed differences in several characteristics of ombudsman practice including the opening statement generation of options ombudsman actions working with leadership and systemic aspects of practice
opening statement while most ombudsmen reported consistently providing an opening statement and several shared this opening statement with me one ombudsman reported consistently not using an opening statement
this ombudsman described that she does explain her role but not up front because she believes the opening statement can be awkward and impede the essential relationship building in the first few minutes of meeting
the ombudsman indicated that she does explain the boundaries of the role as well as the standards of practice and other elements of standard opening statement however these are woven into the discussion
the ombudsman did provide caveat saying that if visitor is unsure of where to start the ombudsman will offer to describe bit about the role and the office
other ombudsmen also described their practice in similar manner if visitor comes in and is bursting to tell their story the ombudsman will not stop them to give the opening statement but rather wait for break or breath from the visitor and then ask permission or offer to describe how the office functions and what the ombudsman might be able to offer
this was also true for ombudsmen who described very emotional visitors
alternatively there were several ombudsmen who reported giving an opening statement up front every time
these ombudsmen described situations when they had not done so and difficult situation emerged that the ombudsmen believe could have journal of the international ombudsman association lisa avoided had the ombudsmen provided the opening statement up front
the differences that emerged between the opening statements are characterized by the depth of which each standard was described as well as how long an ombudsman spent describing the standards which ranged from few minutes or less to fifteen to twenty minutes
differences in option generation according to several ombudsmen this phase can often begin by the ombudsman asking the visitor what they would like to see happen or what the visitor might have already tried to do to resolve the issues
some ombudsmen are hesitant to offer options before hearing what the visitor has already done
one ombudsman described her his concern over how important the idea of options is to the visitor and ultimately what the visitor will do
she described this as are as good as the options that we present at some
another ombudsman described how important it is for the visitor to know what they want because the ombudsman is not in position to make the decision on how the visitor will proceed
another ombudsman described the importance of some of the options being generated by the visitor because of the facilitative mediation background so usually try to elicit and get options from them first and that comes from my facilitative mediation background really encourage that but shifted
jump in with my options as well and think appropriate because am the subject matter expert on
my initial question generally have you thought of what are you doing what kind of options have you considered
others are willing to provide suggestions of options with the caveat that the visitor is welcome to reject every single one
other ombudsmen described how they will arrange the options in range from the least intervention such as do nothing or wait and see to more active options such as file formal complaint or quit
several ombudsmen described feeling like the option they begin with has an impact on how the visitor interprets or evaluates the options
four of the ombudsmen explicitly stated that they are assessing resistance to options as they are presenting them or generating them
one ombudsman described doing this by asking specific types of questions to assess how comfortable visitor is with each of the option si help visitors develop range of possible options and then let them choose which option they would like to take
now in doing so am asking questions to make sure what is their comfort level for each of these options and through that process they emerge from that with direction
and not sure always clear to visitor that happening
when visitor expresses fear or concern about particular option one ombudsman described how she will explore that fear to understand the level of resistance
another ombudsman described this as one more piece of information for the ombudsman to use while helping the visitor come to decision about what to do or not to do
three ombudsmen also indicated that both skill level and willingness to carry out an option such as having conversation with person with whom the visitor is in conflict informs the options an ombudsman might further explore with visitor
ombudsmen will also consider the context of the situation including the roles of the part yi es within the organization when generating options
this contextual information provides the ombudsman with essential details to help generate relevant options
for example if student visits the ombudsman with journal of the international ombudsman association lisa about disrespectful behavior from professor and staff member visits the ombudsman about the same disrespectful treatment the options for each visitor are likely to differ because of the roles each visitor has within the organization
it is likely that the formal options will be different for student than staff member because of the procedures each visitor may have different rights under formal procedures
the informal options are also likely to differ depending on the role of the visitor and the context of the situation
while there are multitude of options that an ombudsman might help generate with visitor there are five generally common options that all of the ombudsmen described formal process option facilitated conversation option escalate higher option end the relationship option and do nothing wait and see option
the formal process option represents many different kinds of formal options such as filing formal complaint filing lawsuit going to the police or filing grievance
several ombudsmen noted trend within the ombudsman field that more ombudsmen refer to these conversations as facilitated conversations and not mediations because the term mediation has taken on more formal connotation
several ombudsmen reported rarely facilitating conversations in their practice for various reasons
one ombudsman indicated that they hesitate to facilitate conversations when there is large power imbalance between the two parties little bit cautious about volunteering to do mediation when there is power differential in the room
so often problematic for the employee later
am willing to do that but that has to absolutely be on the table and discussed openly so that people can have sense of these are what my concerns are
so see that conversation is critical element of it but think some steps that lay the foundation for good conversation rather than reaction where too much emotion gets into it or that kind of thing
twelve of the ombudsmen indicated that they have conversation with both parties separately before bringing them together for facilitated conversation
one ombudsman described the purpose of this separate conversation is to ensure that both parties particularly if there is power imbalance know the risks and benefits of having conversation
another ombudsman described this as part of her his neutrality in providing the same amount of time to both parties
coaching all of the ombudsmen described coaching as an aspect of their practice
coaching can involve roleplaying with the visitor providing materials or resources on conflict resolution giving feedback to the visitor about written correspondence and building skills for the visitor to be able to have conversation without the assistance or facilitation of the ombudsman
three of the ombudsmen described roleplaying with the visitor in preparation for the visitor having conversation with another person
three ombudsmen described giving visitor additional resources such as book or an article to read to help them prepare for conversation
all three referenced providing copy of the book difficult conversations by stone patt on and he en as popular option
fifteen of the ombudsmen reported providing feedback on written correspondence such as email or letter or memo
all of the ombudsmen indicated that they would not write the correspondence for the visitor but would provide feedback around tone and language choice
another ombudsman indicated that she would review and provide feedback to supervisors on their written portions of performance evaluations particularly if the supervisor is providing vague feedback
journal of the international ombudsman association lisa majority of an coaching according to the data is helping visitor build conversation and communication skills to have conversation on their own without the ombudsman present
another aspect of coaching was practice that three ombudsmen called
this practice appears to have resulted from the culture of academic institutions as being very as one ombudsman describes the culture the academy can get very silo oriented where the school of ed
talk to the law school talk to communication talk to the science school or the computer school and so all of sudden there is one secretary feeling like the only one in the world that has this problem and say you know why you reach out to the secretary of the chair of the computer school
the ombudsman described the result of building allies within the university as empowering because one secretary may not be able to make an impact but several secretaries may be able to effect change
another ombudsman described how she speaks with visitors and brainstorms with the visitor who their natural allies might be as well as resources for information who might prove to be allies for the visitor
finally third ombudsman described her his own ally that she has developed over the years in key position within the university
this ombudsman described the ally as person who would be approachable and receptive to visitor in certain situations
this ombudsman described how she would call this key individual and raise hypothetical to get advice on how the visitor might be received in certain department
so the ombudsmen are not only building ally relationships for visitors but ombudsmen themselves have allies within the university to whom they can turn to raise hypothetical situations and receive advice
five of the ombudsmen used the term or when talking about their role in relation to the visitor
these ombudsmen see their role as empowering visitors to make their own decisions
other ombudsmen did not use the terms empower or empowerment however they described their role in similar fashion such as the visitor to take action on their own or be in control of their future
one ombudsman reported that she would frame options as the visitor being proactive as first step in most situations and that the ombudsman could engage after those options failed was very clear about how in some way having interventions was something to consider after none of the other visitor being proactive steps will
the ombudsman further explained the reasoning behind this as twofold so that the visitor has ownership of the outcome not the ombudsman and so that the ombudsman calling up another party in the conflict such as supervisor would not create additional issues of trust or escalate the conflict unnecessarily
in this experience the act of the ombudsman calling up another party can often be met with many questions including the visitor just come to me if they had problem
another ombudsman described the empowerment as part of her his conflict coaching with the visitor their capacity to do something to help
working with leadership many of the ombudsmen described how they built relationships with key leaders within the organization as well as the nature of the relationship the ombudsmen have with leadership including how often the ombudsmen meet with and the nature of the meetings with leadership
the work ombudsmen do with leadership can be described in terms of the frequency of meetings from meeting only once year with the president or the leader to whom the ombudsman reports journal of the international ombudsman association lisa meeting at least once month or more often if either the leader or ombudsman requests meeting
several of the ombudsmen reported that their work with leadership has evolved since they started
one ombudsman described her his relationship with leadership as increasing as priority since she first started in the organization
work with leadership was also described in terms of the standard of practice of independence or informality
one ombudsman described her his role within the organization as an inside outsider
this term has been used to describe this aspect of an practice previously see bark at wagner
this particular ombudsman described her his work with leadership in the following way and that is something that pursue much of in my first few years of doing this and now do because it makes not an entirely an outsider
so think so bad to have big footprint and to have something of reputation and to have the presence and to do that though
do draw the line at going to social do think that it is important to understand the heart and the soul and the strategic direction of your institution even if you disagree with it because you have to work with your strengths as well as its weaknesses and you have to try to understand what they are
another ombudsman described her his work with leadership as less involved compared to the ombudsman above
this ombudsman described wariness of the perception others might have of the relationship with our standing meetings and the annual report meetings really more on an ad hoc basis
there is part of me leery about those kinds of meetings
you know want to be seen to be part of that group
actually think meeting with the president quarterly might be little much
these two examples are indicative of the differences between interpretation of the standard of independence as discussed above as well as the resulting ways an ombudsman might practice given their interpretation of their role regarding leadership within the organization
systemic aspect of practice for some ombudsmen the organization can be described as the system within which the ombudsman operates and accordingly they take more to their work
one ombudsman when asked to describe her his practice began by saying cases kind of act as data points in our landscape and consider part of my role pretty significant part actually is looking for patterns within that landscape and using my knowledge of discrete issues or cases to put things together that maybe are of the same flavor and then figuring out how can we back this up to the point of origin and consider some other process or if some policy that would keep these people from falling over the cliff
another ombudsman when discussing how her his office was created and established said that the organization expected the ombudsman to take systemic approach to managing conflict wanted systems approach to conflict
other ombudsmen identified this as an area for growth in their own practice and described desire to learn more about identifying systemic issues as well as being more proactive once potential systemic issue is raised
journal of the international ombudsman association lisa of the ombudsmen were asked to provide their definition of systemic issue
one of the more common responses was issue that impacts multiple people at larger
one ombudsman described how her his office differentiates between trends and systemic issues my office we would say that having multiple people come in about particular issue is trend and systemic issue is really where there is gap and that could be one case or it could be multiple people so systemic gap in policy practice or culture
just because multiple people come in it may be trend but it may not be evidence necessarily of systemic gap
two of the ombudsmen identified discomfort in using the word or because they described the information that they have as more anecdotal and not scientifically significant to warrant the use of the term
one of these two ombudsman said will say like the word because again feel comfortable enough statistically if only see one percent of our population and all negatives does that mean we have trend in the institution or does that mean that of the people are doing great
some aspects of systemic practice included how the ombudsmen raised these issues the format in which they raised them and to whom they were raised
ten of the ombudsmen indicated that they report trends or systemic issues in written annual report while three survey respondents indicated that they prefer only to provide verbal information
one survey respondent indicated that they do not report any information including trends or systemic issues to their organization
two ombudsmen indicated that the culture of her his organization and her his reporting structure makes it difficult to raise systemic level issues
another aspect of the systemic part of an practice includes what actions an ombudsman might take in response to systemic level issues
examples of these from the data included providing training such as conflict resolution skills training development or review of policy or other actions related to policy review or development and providing specific feedback or raising specific issue to the leadership of the organization or the appropriate authority within the organization to address the concern
one ombudsman provided an example of how she was involved in raising concerns about equitable treatment of an entire population within the organization which resulted in creation of policy to address the treatment of this particular population
the same ombudsman like several of her his colleagues expressed concern with reviewing policy or being an author of policy for fear of the impact on their independence or neutrality
several ombudsmen indicated that the culture of the organization impacts how change particularly systemic change is implemented as well as how feedback is received
finally the last aspect of how an ombudsman engages with the organization is how the ombudsmen define their role more broadly in terms of how they operate within the organization
one ombudsman summarized her his opinion about this aspect and captured sentiments shared by other ombudsmen think there is distinction between philosophical approach by om buds programs that should state that think there are some om buds whose and not saying that one is better than the other philosophical appro ache is to sit back and until things come to and then the more assertive see something on the horizon
see this this this and this and need to put this on the radar here because have broader perspective journal of the international ombudsman association lisa think this is going to be problem
and so find way to go
and call that the more assertive approach to organizational om buds
am more in the latter the more assertive of more organizational structure patterns and types of things and putting things on the key decision makers necessarily mean that the most senior decision maker is the key decision maker so they can be dealt with and addressed pro actively and the key
not reactionary om buds and so this program is not that and think in my opinion that that has been why this institution and the senior leadership regard us as highly successful
this description is similar to another ombudsman who described this aspect of her his practice as their within the organization
composite story was developed as result of my realization during the data analysis that the actual process of an engagement with an individual visitor has not been identified in the body of research examined
the process is outlined in professional development trainings for organizational ombudsmen
the story below is composite of the process described by the participants about their initial interactions with visitor
while every interaction with visitor may not follow this process the data indicated that many interactions follow this loose process or structure
the visitor contacts the ombudsman to make an appointment
the method of contact varies from telephone email or unannounced walk ins to the office
some ombudsman offices have support staff who make appointments while others manage their own schedules
the ombudsman and visitor exchange initial pleasantries and the ombudsman invites the visitor into her his office
often the ombudsman will begin by giving his or her or description of the role of the ombudsman and outline the four standards of practice of confidentiality informality independence and neutrality impartiality
some ombudsmen use written materials to give to the visitor with these standards of practice outlined and all of the ombudsmen interviewed have these standards outlined on their web sites
if the visitor is particularly distressed or begins speaking before the ombudsman can begin her his opening statement some ombudsmen reported providing the visitor with description of their role at later point in the meeting
some ombudsmen described not consistently providing an opening statement but rather the standards of practice as appropriate
after the opening statement or description of the role the ombudsman will invite the visitor to speak about their situation
this transition from the opening statement to the story telling is done in different ways
some ombudsmen use silence to indicate the visitor can begin while others have specific questions to ask the visitor such as me why come or you tell me how you think can be
the ombudsman will use various listening techniques such as active listening looping or remaining quiet while the visitor describes their situation
some ombudsmen are listening for specific purpose such as identifying the issues and underlying interests while others may listen for deeper understanding of the situation
many ombudsmen will encourage or invite the visitor to describe how other people involved in the situation where applicable might describe the situation
this so called can occur during this story telling phase later on in the process or during multiple phases
some ombudsmen will limit this storytelling phase either journal of the international ombudsman association lisa such as outlining the structure of the meeting including time for each stage or indirectly such as using questions or summary to move the meeting into the next stage while others allow the visitor to determine how much time they need to describe their situation
after the visitor has an opportunity to describe their situation the ombudsman will often provide summary of what they have heard including the main issues and perhaps the interests of the visitor
at this point the visitor can clarify for the ombudsman any of the issues or interests
some ombudsmen do not provide summary and move directly into the next phase
next the ombudsman moves towards working with the visitor to identify options for the visitor going forward
this phase sometimes begins with the ombudsman asking questions such as have you done to address the situation
or do you think are your options
some ombudsmen identify or describe the options as range of options from to informal options to more formal options while others start at one end or the other of described range of options such as most proactive to least proactive and work towards the other while describing options in between the two ends of the spectrum
another way that ombudsmen speak about options is to find out what the visitor already has in mind or what the visitor may have already considered or tried
there are two different approaches that emerged from the data for suggesting options some ombudsmen prefer to hear what the visitor is considering as their options before suggesting options and some ombudsmen suggest options without specifically ait ing or the visitor to suggest options first
some ombudsmen describe this phase in the process as more of brainstorming and collaborative process
the types of options that are commonly identified are do nothing wait and see visitor speaks directly to another persons in an interpersonal conflict visitor seeks additional resources or information such as policy clarification ombudsman with permission speaks to another persons involved in the situation ombudsman inquires within the organization about situation either to raise hypothetical or gather more information clarify policy ombudsman brings concerns to senior administrator either hypothetically or with specific details ombudsman facilitates or mediates discussion between the visitor and another persons ombudsman coaches the visitor on how to have conversation on their own visitor uses formal process such as filing complaint within or outside of the university visitor transfers to another department or position and visitor quits their job school
this is not an exhaustive list but representation of some commonly identified options
these options are not mutually exclusive and many ombudsmen report that combination of options is explored
additionally all of the ombudsmen reported that they would not take an action unless they have the permission of the visitor with the common exception of hearing of an imminent risk of harm to the visitor or another persons and some of the ombudsmen also add the caveat that they too must agree to take an action
once the options have been identified and sometimes in conjunction with the identification of options there is an evaluation or decision by the visitor on which option or options to carry out
during this phase the ombudsman is often asking questions to help the visitor evaluate the options
this can be done by weighing pros and cons of the options prior it izing options identifying risks of each option andor doing what many ombudsmen refer to as or
ultimately the visitor is the person who must make the decision on how to proceed
all of the ombudsmen reported that their role is not to determine course of action but to provide the visitor with the resources to make decision
some ombudsmen encourage visitor to not make decision during the initial meeting but to take time to think about the options and perhaps discuss with other journal of the international ombudsman association lisa whom the visitor trusts and then return to the ombudsman when they have either made decision on how to proceed or have taken some time to consider the options
some ombudsmen systematically or regularly follow up with visitors while others may not routinely follow up with visitor
any subsequent meetings with visitor or additional parties is dependent upon the individual case so composite of follow up meetings is not possible based on the data
this composite story follows the general outline that is taught in the foundational ombudsman training provided by the
it is important to note that the ombudsmen interviewed included individuals who have not taken this training or similar trainings provided by previous ombudsman associations such as the ombudsman association and university and college om buds association as well as individuals who have taken andor teach or have taught the foundational ombudsman training
thus an additional outcome of this research is not just connection that individuals who have taken ombudsman training report that they practice how they were trained but possible indicator that the training provided reflects the reported practice of organizational ombudsmen
further research on this specific topic could determine correlation
conclusion the purpose of this study was to develop theory about organizational ombudsman practice that can be later tested
the theory that emerged was the three main influences on an organizational ombudsman practice are interpretation and ope rationalization of the standards of practice self and organization
the theory was validated by the participants and one or two of the participants indicated that the influence of other organizational ombudsmen should be elevated to fourth category from within self
this indicates that further exploration of each of the three categories is warranted
this research provided many more questions than answers about how organizational ombudsmen practice and why they practice in the manner they do
the data revealed both consistencies and inconsistencies in practice
the composite story revealed that there are overall consistencies in the major elements of an initial meeting however the intricacies of how each ombudsman practices within those major elements varies
it is clear that ombudsmen make decisions about how they practice much like mediators make decisions
research currently being conducted at rut gers university by kenneth kr es sel may inform future research for determining how ombudsmen make decisions at various junctures in their practice

smith associate ombudsman national institutes of health bethesda md om buds mediation frequency circumstances and differences amongst backgrounds the beginnings it was dark and cold day the snow had fallen in torrents two days before and the federal government was finally reopening
it was that same day that started my internship with the national institutes of health office of the ombudsman center for cooperative resolution
from the beginning much of my time as an intern was spent tagging along with different staff to observe cases and trainings
in addition was expected to develop meaningful project to work on during my stay
it did not take me long to realize that wanted my project to include research related to organizational om buds ing
the organization om buds profession and field are constantly growing yet in the large scheme of things they are still very much in an early stage
consequently there is need for added inquiry journal of the international ombudsman association tyler smith and research to provide past current and future practitioners with greater understanding of the characteristics role and function of the
in well respected practicing oos alan lincoln mary ro we and tom kos ako ws ki worked to develop proposed international ombudsman association research agenda for the study of the profession
the agenda consisted of three broad topic areas including the om buds professional the om buds profession and om buds practices lincoln ro we and
the group dug bit further to develop questions under each of the main topics
under the topic this included the question of did oos come from academically and professionally
under the topic this included the question of trends in issues and concerns are we observing of those we assist
and under the topic this included multiple questions such as tools including skills do we use to assist constituents
as floated from one staff to another observing cases and trainings was exposed to various styles and approaches to the same type of work
at the same time started to realize that each had different professional and academic backgrounds and experiences
wondered how much of an impact their backgrounds had on the way they approached their work
given the fact that can encompass so many duties quickly recognized it would be important to narrow my focus
at the time the one aspect of om buds ing that was most interested in was mediation
this did not come as surprise to me as was heavily involved in different aspects of community mediation before starting the internship
in addition to the influence of my previous experience my case observations frequently involved observing facilitated conversation or mediation
the at is frequently involved in facilitating conversations often the preferred term over mediation between employees supervisors students etc
and at times even asked to serve as mediators for the pre complaint stage of the equal employment opportunity process and the initial stages of an administrative grievance peer resolution process prp
narrowed my interests to oos academic and professional backgrounds and whether or not differences exist between oos of different backgrounds as to how they approach specific aspects of mediation in their work as an
the initial survey questionnaire research efforts focused on the following aspects of mediation how often oos explored mediation as an option the types of circumstances in which mediation is explored as an option the oos preferred set up and preparation for the mediation process and the oos style approach to the mediation process itself
as the first in an envisioned series this paper will briefly highlight gap in research describe the methodology and provide results and discussion related to backgrounds and the frequency and circumstances in which they explore mediation
existing research and the need for more it is generally understood that backgrounds vary both academically and professionally
an academic background includes the collection of one or more academic disciplines an individual has experience in as result of degree in higher education
likewise professional background includes the collection of one or more professional positions an individual has experience in prior to becoming an
early survey research by ro we and mun zen rider found that many corporate backgrounds include areas such as liberal arts economics engineering and law
more recently when collecting information about respondents for mixed method research levin ef in ley and carter found that the backgrounds of pioneers of the field consisted of va journal of the international ombudsman association tyler of academic disciplines including but not limited to business conflict resolution counseling east asian studies economics educational psychology engineering english law and backgrounds in professional positions in adult education affirmative action employee assistance programs undergraduate counseling human resources and science
in an informational section about the role of the the web site identifies backgrounds in disciplines ranging from the sciences to academia management human resources law engineering accounting consulting and everything in between
while some studies have been conducted which incorporated aspects of backgrounds there is still substantial need to understand more about the nonsingular path to becoming an
beyond basic understanding of background diversity amongst oos no studies were found that explore differences in practice based on academic and professional backgrounds
however other fields such as mediation have explored this topic
like oos the academic and professional backgrounds of mediators are varied
several studies looked at the differences in mediation practice amongst mediators with varying backgrounds
significant number of those studies have focused specifically on mediators with backgrounds in law
when examining practices in family mediation found many differences in dispute characteristics populations served and methods or options utilized between lawyer mediators and mental health practitioner mediators
along similar lines recent study of divorce mediation by bait ar et al
found were more advisory advocacy and settlement oriented whereas mental health professionals were more likely to use interest based strategies and aim for self determination quality of inter partner interaction and processing emotions in their
oos coming from various backgrounds including areas like law and mental health may have different perspectives on and approaches to mediation
also the way an might experience and approach mediation can be different from traditional mediator that is an individual who practices exclusively as mediator
there are very few resources of information aside from research and explanations on web sites brochures and other promotional materials that describe mediation in the context of an or an office
in many parts of the world mediation has been part of effective dispute resolution systems for decades
the key elements of mediation in conflict management systems include having third party who brings people together in order to address problem and reach settlement on their own or with the assistance of the third party ro we
in some situations an might be the mediator
differences do exist however between an mediator and traditional mediator
often individuals come to the office for one on one help from the who listens provides and receives information reframes issues and develops options andor makes referrals to help people help themselves without direct intervention by the ro we
mediation is just one of the tools an can use when more than one person is involved in the situation
oos also have other options of working with multiple parties that may not involve direct intervention or joint conversation
found mediation to be ranked surprisingly low on list of approaches and techniques corporate oos used
one reason for this was that disputants together in front of them might create embarrassment and make resolution more
recent research on offices in higher education by new hart however found that out of respondents of the offices strongly agreed or agreed that they employ techniques
the study used transformative mediation as the example of
an additional survey study of om buds persons from public and private spanish universities in found that the majority of interventions consisted of informal mediation al cover
journal of the international ombudsman association tyler smith despite the clear lack of research in this area what does exist provides an understanding that mediation is just one of the many services an might use but given the circumstances may not always be the most effective or desired option
therefore further emphasis should be put on not only how often mediation is explored by oos but the types of circumstance as well
an important distinction to make between this study and many of the previous studies lies in the word
previous studies have merely asked the question of how often is mediation used
this study sought to identify how frequently the individual the option of mediation
using the word allows there to be an examination of the individual preference and idea of appropriateness
simply looking at how often mediation is used ignores those important characteristics and presents limitations
for instance mediation would not be reported as if the original party accepted but the other parties involved declined or were never contacted
methodology sampling the method for sampling used in this study was nonprobability voluntary based
in nonprobability based sampling reliability cannot be measured the only way to address data quality is to compare some of the survey questionnaire results with available information about the population
the respondents to the survey instrument were therefore compared to the sector representation of membership
regardless it is still important to make generalizations very cautiously
instrument the survey questionnaire instrument in this study was original and developed through brainstorm of primary questions which addressed four areas academic and professional background information frequency in which the option of mediation is explored the circumstances in which the option of mediation might be explored and approaches to mediation preparation and process
following the brainstorm process questions were narrowed down with input and feedback obtained from oos at as well as dr brian pol kinghorn executive director of the bosser man center for conflict resolution
after several drafts revision and restructuring the question survey questionnaire was put into electronic format using survey gizmo com
the final version of the survey questionnaire included title page that briefly described the researcher the research and provided loose definition of mediation
mediation was defined as process in which two or more parties work to resolve their differences with the assistance of neutral third party in this case the
procedure the survey questionnaire was opened for days starting march th and ending on april rd
the survey questionnaire was deployed via the international ombudsman list serv which includes approximately individuals many of whom are practicing oos from all over the world
in addition to the list serv email reminder email was sent to randomly selected individuals and offices from different sectors with the help of contact information resources on the the om buds bl og web site
on april th post was made with brief description of the study and link to the online survey questionnaire to the front page of the om buds bl og
those who chose to respond to the survey questionnaire had the options of choosing to remain anonymous or to provide name and brief contact information for future followup
journal of the international ombudsman association tyler smith analysis the objective of this analysis and results was to provide descriptive and interpretive information on the backgrounds the frequency in which mediation is explored and the types of circumstances in which mediation is explored
as result responses to the survey questionnaire were first analyzed using reporting function which allowed the researcher to produce real time summary profile and cross tab reports
summary and comparison reports were used to obtain the majority of the descriptive results for all closed ended survey questionnaire questions
descriptive and interpretive conclusions were derived from the open ended survey questionnaire questions through qualitative textual analysis process
the qualitative textual analysis process provided deductive procedure to generate and organize themes and categories
after major categories of academic and professional background were identified filters were applied one at time to merely display responses from individuals who indicated having academic and professional backgrounds in the top six disciplines and positions
responses to both the close ended quantitative and open ended qualitative questions were then compared across the various top six academic and professional backgrounds using frequency tables
since there were varying numbers of respondents in each of the top six academic disciplines and professional positions the number of respondents for each answer was divided by the total number of responses in each particular discipline or position resulting in percentage
tables are used in the section to further illustrate analysis and comparisons
each table displays percentage and raw response number
results respondents at the closing of the survey questionnaire on april rd total of oos had responded
of the respondents completed all questions
amongst the respondents variety of sectors and experience levels analogous to the makeup of membership were represented
at higher education was the most represented sector in the survey followed by government corporate school healthcare and other
in addition to sector the respondents were asked to indicate their highest degree of completed education years of experience as an
at degree was the most common highest level of completed education followed by doctorate advanced professional and
when it comes to years of experience respondents were able to choose from variety of answers ranging from less than one year of experience all the way up to or more years of experience
for analysis purposes the answer selections were later broken down into four levels of experiences to years to years to years and years
at to years of experience was the most common followed by to years to years and years
backgrounds respondents were given two lists one academic and one professional and asked to check all options that applied to their complete academic and professional backgrounds
each question asked respondents to check one or more options from diverse list of academic disciplines and professional backgrounds displayed in table and
the question specifically used the language to becoming an
an additional option was included in each list
if the respondent chose they were asked to specify the academic disciplines or professional positions that was were not already captured on the list
journal of the international ombudsman association tyler smith academic background from the list of academic disciplines there was at least one respondent who had an academic background in each discipline listed except for engineering
in addition to the academic disciplines included on the developed list of respondents added disciplines using the option
some of those disciplines included criminology anthropology history mathematics mental health public administration policy analysis social work and victim ology
at the top of the respondents indicated that they had some academic background in conflict resolution
law followed conflict resolution closely with
the remaining top six academic disciplines included psychology teaching education business and organizational development
respondents from the top six most common academic disciplines were used throughout the rest of the study for comparison analysis
professional background from the list of professional positions there was at least one respondent who had professional background in each position listed except for engineer
in addition to the professional positions included on the developed list of respondents added positions using the option
some of those positions included trainer admissions counselor analyst athlete banker artist writer economist caseworker victim advocate journalist researcher director of and contract negotiator
the most common professional position in this survey questionnaire was manager administrator with
second to manager administrator was mediator with
the remaining top six professional positions included professor facilitator lawyer and counselor
respondents from the top six most common professional positions were also used throughout the rest of the study for comparison analysis
it should also be noted that the position of teacher like counselor was also
in order to keep the top number at six counselor was chosen for further analysis rather than teacher but for no explicit reason
backgrounds and experience while level of experience was not primary or secondary area of research the study focused on by collecting data on experience levels academic and professional backgrounds could then be compared amongst the different levels of experience
table and table display which academic disciplines and professional positions were common within the four levels of experience
while there were an uneven number of respondents from each level of experience after calculating percentages there was clear variance in how common specific academic disciplines and professional positions are amongst oos with different levels of experience
exploring the option of mediation respondents were asked cases where more than one individual is involved how frequently would you say you explore the option of mediation to address the problems or concerns
response options included always often sometimes seldom and never
of the respondents to this question the most common answer was sometimes at followed by often seldom always and never
the respondents who chose were directed to question which asked them
although there were only two respondents who chose some reasons included for the number of people served and geographical which can make it challenging to bring people together and even concerns with how the term or process of mediation fits into the role
journal of the international ombudsman association tyler smit hoo backgrounds and exploring the option of mediation by using the results of the academic and professional background questions the frequency in which oos explore the option of mediation was broken down and compared amongst the top six academic and professional backgrounds
amongst the top six academic disciplines there were no strong differences observed
the answers and still remained as the most common response
however there were some other interesting results from this analysis
for example oos who indicated having an academic background in teaching education were the most likely to explore the option of mediation
on the other end the only two respondents who indicated that they explore the option of mediation both came from an academic background in business
additionally the table shows that oos who indicated having an academic background in law were the only group that had zero responses for the and options
similarly amongst the top six professional positions there was no strong difference observed
the answers and still remained as the most common
the breakdown does however show that lawyer was the only category of professional position that had respondents who did not answer in any way other than and
it also shows that oos who indicated having professional experience as manager administrator had the most or responses
table and display the frequency of exploring the option mediation by all top six academic and professional positions
the circumstances oos consider for mediation respondents were asked about the circumstances in which they would explore the option of mediation with visitors
because the question specified cases where more than one individual is it was assumed that respondents answered the questions with the understanding that at least one other person other than the visitor would be involved in the given circumstances
rather than having the respondents pick from set list of options data was obtained through an open ended question which asked respondents to describe the types of circumstances that might lead them to think of mediation as possible option for addressing problem or concern
responses to this question varied in context length and detail
qualitative textual analysis instead revealed that respondents were likely to consider one or more of the following six categories when deciding whether or not to explore mediation with visitor the relationship the nature of the problem or concern the openness to mediation the options or alternative to mediation the mediation process benefits and the prospective mediation result
across the board the majority of respondents considered more than one of these categories some putting greater emphasis on some categories than others
the subsequent section provides descriptive results of each of the six main categories as well as any supplementary subcategories
any indicators of importance within or amongst the categories are based on the frequency in which specific phrases words or additional aspects were observed in comparison to others
it was in this analysis that perhaps some of the key results of this research surfaced
under the relationship category several subcategories emerged including how the parties are affiliated with each other the power dynamics between them and their relationship needs
some of the ways in which parties are affiliated with each other were described as either equal levels such as colleagues and fellow students or im balanced levels such as supervisor and an employee or professor and student
some respondents specified particular affiliation while others mentioned several
for example one respondent indicated that they mediate situations between students administrators and while other respondents indicated that they mediate between an employee and
journal of the international ombudsman association tyler smith although affiliation was cited rather often there was no clear suggestion that it carried heavy influence on the decision of whether or not to explore mediation
no respondents specifically expressed refusal to mediate situation exclusively based on the affiliation with one another
power was another important part of the relationship
several respondents described the importance of power dynamics when considering whether or not to explore the option of mediation
because of the high frequency in which power was mentioned amongst respondents it appeared to be more substantial than the basic affiliation with one another
however power was not the most significant aspect of the relationship
in many ways how parties relate to each other might directly infer what the power dynamics are
for instance formal authority might give them more power over an employee imbalance whereas colleagues in the same or similar position or students in class might have equal power balance
amongst respondents who did indicate power as something they consider before exploring the option of mediation some were okay with mediating in situations where power is im balanced others would more likely consider mediating in situations where power was reasonably balanced
for example one respondent specified that they would be more likely to explore the option of mediation in circumstances where is an imbalance in power between the or there is real or perceived power
on the other hand different respondents indicated that they would be more likely to consider exploring the option of mediation in circumstance where are relatively balanced levels of power between the there is not large power or even the power relationships are at the same
the data collected in this category illustrated very diverse approach to power differences as it relates to an decision to explore mediation
exceeding power respondents mentioned the relationship needs most frequently
the needs were sometimes described as lost trust or respect for each
the most common way it was described however was the need as one respondent put it preserve or maintain working because an relationships is for their work to be performed
as result mediation may be an option to help the working
contrary to the majority of respondents who spoke about relationship needs one respondent did describe mediation as process that is most often explored in that have less investment in relationship
under the nature of the problems or concerns category subcategories emerged such as issue focused problems people focused problems and
in all the problem or concern was the category most considered in exploring mediation
similarly to others one respondent clearly indicated on the outset of their response that depends upon the context of the
when describing the respondents had tendency to put emphasis on either issue focused problems people focused problems or combination of both
issue focused problems are characterized as problems or concerns that involve more concrete tangi matters and place less importance on relationship and other interpersonal dynamics
topics such as grades projects assignments authorship money and syllabi were amongst some of the issues focused problems that respondents described
journal of the international ombudsman association tyler smith people focused problems on the other hand are most likely matters that involve collegial relationship and other interpersonal dynamics
some examples of people focused problems highlighted in responses included communication misunderstandings conduct behavior diverse perspectives and overall confusion
the majority of respondents said they were most likely to use mediation for communication related problems or concerns
select number of respondents actually indicated that they lean towards considering mediation for problems or concerns related to
the category was created to capture the nature of problem or concern some respondents referred to that did not fit within the issue focused or people focused problem categories
for instance some respondents described consideration of whether or not the problem or concern to interests vs
power or the complexity of the problem and whether or not problem or concern was
one respondent even described mediation to be neither appropriate nor effective in addressing systemic problems
additional responses in the category included legal matters where mediation might be used as way to directly avoid litigation and circumstances when the actions fall into legal or illegal
he openness to mediation category included subcategories such as the voluntary nature of the situation and the parties comfort and sense of safety in using mediated process
across the range of respondents oos were largely on the same page in regards to ensuring that mediation is only explored in circumstances where each of the involved parties are willing to come together in voluntary fashion and feel safe in doing so
the notion of voluntariness was considered in several different ways
respondents expressed the need to make sure the circumstance was one in which all parties the mediation and are to come
some respondents described considering mediation only in circumstances where one or more of the parties requested mediation themselves
comfort and safety were likewise considered in several different ways
for example one respondent alluded to comfort and safety expressing the need to make sure that the circumstance is one where is little to no fear of retaliation or negative
other respondents mentioned safety and comfort by acknowledging that mediation may require the parties to have difficult conversation and therefore they want to make sure the parties are comfortable with having that conversation
along the same line some respondents expressed the ability to provide safe place during mediated process
this was especially true if conversations in the past between the parties were found to be difficult to discuss without environment facilitator to manage the
he options and alternative to mediation category included subcategories such as the options that may have been explored exhausted or unsuccessful already as well as the options or alternative on the table if mediation is not used
the category also captures considerations of the time and energy that other options or alternatives might require
considering options was something frequently stated in response to this question
as one respondent put it must in partnership with the visitor determine which interventions have greatest likelihood of
not only was it important to determine how appropriate mediation might be in particular circumstance but to first understand what other options had been andor might be
some described the importance of understanding what options have already been attempted and how successful they have been
for instance some respondents specified circumstances where individual consultation conflict coaching and communication journal of the international ombudsman association tyler smith behavioral plans of action effective formal mediation is then
another respondent described exploring the option of mediation when methods eg coaching having caller work with human resources or higher levels of management are not
other respondents paid more attention to the alternatives to not using mediation
for example is the alternative something more within formal process like investigations or and therefore mediation might be more attractive option of informally working together to find resolution
additionally respondents considered exploring mediation if circumstances existed such as is not an or if to resolving the problem are expensive time consuming or such as having to through additional bureaucratic
the results of this section suggest clear difference in not only the types of options and alternatives that oos might explore or consider but to what extent they believe considering other options first is needed
he mediation process benefits category covered wide spectrum of mediation characteristics
some of the characteristics associated with this category were related to benefits of the mediation process yet the responses did not easily break down into subcategories
the mediation process benefits category was created after clear theme had appeared throughout the responses
some of the circumstances identified by respondents included those where parties might benefit from coming together down and in that would allow to be and parties to
many of these benefits were tied to effects of providing and even to establish ground
some respondents focused more on the benefits of developing or options in ways that honor the parties
additional benefits of mediation mentioned included emotion and the blame game out of the equation and keeping the participants on
while many of the suggested mediation benefits are not novel it is interesting to understand what characteristics of the mediation process oos see as most valuable and useful for parties to particular conflict
he prospective mediation result category like the mediation process benefits category did not have distinct subcategories
this category was developed primarily because notable number of respondents indicated that the possible result of mediated process was factor in considering it as an option
many of the responses that indicated any language such as change improve salvage resolve and settle were in the context of other previously described categories
this implies that creating the right conditions through mediation may lead to particular result
for instance some respondents described using mediation in circumstances where the parties have an to improve salvage or otherwise renegotiate working or facilitated communication of mediation might help the parties improve their communication working
other responses included relationships and communication practices can improve from mediated or when parties are to possible compromise or
each one of the examples above highlight prospective mediation result in combination with other things such as process benefits voluntariness relationships and the nature of the problem or concern communication
no respondents considered exploring mediation if there was certainty that specific outcome would transpire
journal of the international ombudsman association tyler smit hoo backgrounds and circumstances considered for mediation to explore differences amongst various backgrounds in circumstances considered frequencies of the six categories described in the previous section were compared amongst respondents with backgrounds in the top six academic disciplines and professional positions
those frequencies are displayed using table and table
each table illustrates two important pieces first the frequency of each consideration including the highest and second the table identifies what academic disciplines and professional positions had the highest frequency in each category of consideration
academic background compared in regards to the frequency of each consideration regardless of the academic background the of the problem or appeared as the highest
in other words when describing the circumstances in which they would explore the option of mediation respondents from all six academic backgrounds expressed consideration around the of the problem or most often
while all academic disciplines demonstrated the of the problem or as the highest law and conflict resolution were even higher than the rest by at least
respondents with conflict resolution academic background also appeared highest for the and openness to categories
respondents with an academic background in law on the other hand appeared highest for the and alternatives to category
other disciplines with the highest frequencies for particular categories of consideration include psychology in mediation and business in process
table further displays differences in frequencies
professional background compared when it comes to frequency of each consideration of the problem or was also highest in frequency for all professional positions except for facilitator
while they were still high in of the problem or respondents with facilitator background were more likely to consider the openness to
respondents with counselor background were actually tied for highest in considering of the problem or and and alternative to
in fact in responses with counselor background the categories were evenly dispersed
those with mediator background considered of the problem or the most
professors while high in of the problem or were also the highest in considering the and the openness to
at the same time only of the respondents with professor background indicated considering the and alternatives to
all other professional positions considered the and alternatives to noticeably more
respondents with background as lawyer were highest in considering the process and mediation
table further displays the differences in frequencies
in designing the survey questionnaire it was important to not assume that all oos would be the mediator if problem or concern was addressed through mediation
in fact quite few organizations have separate offices or entities that provide mediation or partner with an external program that provides mediation services
after asking respondents how often they explore the option of mediation and the circumstances that might lead them to think of mediation as possible option for addressing problem or concern they were then asked to indicate whether or not they would mediate the situation themselves or make referral to another office
of the respondents indicated that they would mediate the situation themselves
only said they would make referral to another office
journal of the international ombudsman association tyler smith discussion as previously mentioned generalizations from this research should be made cautiously primarily because of the sampling method further limitations are described below
nonetheless there are several thought provoking observations to discuss
this study first set out to identify backgrounds and determine whether or not differences existed between oos of different backgrounds and the frequency in which they explore mediation as an option with visitor as well as the specific circumstances in which they typically explore mediation as an option with visitor
in many ways questions were answered in other ways more questions have been raised
the data collected in this study provide additional clarity on backgrounds whether widespread not widespread or
some backgrounds for example law and business still remain popular especially amongst newer oos
the results show that some specific academic disciplines and professional positions are becoming more popular amongst oos but with very different backgrounds are still led to the role
also the number of those with backgrounds identified in earlier studies such as economics and engineering are decreasing amongst oos
the data also shows that in the last decade significant number of oos are entering the profession with conflict re so lu ti on experience both academically and professionally as mediators fac il ita tors negotiators etc
the survey data are reflecting trend illustrated in study by pol kinghorn and chena il which concluded that in there were approximately conflict resolution related graduate programs internationally that offered certificates minor concentrations and doctorate degrees up from only four programs in
with this increase will more individuals with direct conflict resolution experience choose career as an
many of the skills and techniques utilized by practicing oos such as nonjudgmental listening the ability to communicate successfully with diverse range of people courage to speak up discretion creativity in developing options and problem solving and analytical ability are closely related to those taught in conflict resolution academic and training programs
traditionally oos have been hired after having extensive experience in other positions with their companies ro we mun zen rider
this gives them the advantage of having organizational trust understanding knowledge and networks that can undoubtedly aid the work of the
in addition to the likely desirable characteristics they already possess they can then learn and acquire additional needed skills and techniques through training or exposure
consistent with the findings of new hart and al cover the results of this survey questionnaire suggest that many oos consider exploring mediation with visitors with indicating sometimes or more
without making sweeping generalization it should still be noted that the few oos who indicated that they do not often explore the option of mediation choose not to more often than not because of organizational limitations such as size and geographic dispersion which are in no way related to their background
another reason for not exploring mediation identified in the results was because the process of mediation or the term can be perceived as too formal and therefore belongs outside of the realm of practice
further research should be conducted in order to gain better understanding of why oos might not explore mediation
journal of the international ombudsman association tyler smith the variations in these data amongst oos of different backgrounds and frequency in which they explore mediation suggest that there could be connection but that connection may be weak in comparison to other factors that influence practice
further research should focus on establishing criteria that can be used to filter out and identify particular influences
when it comes to the circumstances in which oos explore mediation differences amongst backgrounds were not clearly identified
similar to comparisons with frequency there may be additional factors that influence the decision to explore mediation with vis tit or aside from background
nonetheless the open ended question to elicit data provided an added layer of understanding around the decision making process of individual oos
the categories that emerged were in many ways similar to those described in an article by al cover which used information from the survey as well as other research and literature on the university context to develop contingent model for mediation in the university setting
the contingent model focuses on power relations between the parties involved temporal perspective of the relationships and formalization of the mediation process as potential constraints that may affect the desirability and effectiveness of mediation specifically for university dispute
backgrounds aside responses demonstrated strong consistency in some areas as well as stark contrast in others in perspective around the use of mediation
for instance categories like the openness to the mediation process exhibited strong consistency no indicated exploring mediation despite party being unwilling or uninterested consistent with the values of work
in other categories of consideration such as the relationship oos undoubtedly expressed varying perspectives
for example when it came to the notion of power as previously indicated some oos only considered mediating when power is relatively balanced while others appeared to be much less concerned about power dynamics
similarly data related to options and alternative to mediation demonstrates distinctions in when mediation might be introduced as an option
for instance some respondents gave the impression that they regularly consider mediation as an option from the beginning
other respondents seemed less inclined to explore mediation from the beginning and explore other options perhaps viewing mediation as final option to avoid more formal process
limitations there are limitations to the significance of the results that are important to note
first survey questionnaire method was used for its cost effectiveness and short collection time
survey questionnaire data collection is limited particularly validity because it allows only for self reporting
respondents may not provide accurate honest answers because they do not want to present themselves in an unfavorable way
in addition the survey questionnaire could lead to unclear data because respondents may interpret certain questions and answer options differently
for instance the term was loosely defined for respondents at the beginning of the survey questionnaire yet the word mediation can certainly imply different meaning for individuals which can ultimately determine the way they respond to particular question
nonprobability volunteer based sampling is also limitation for this study
it is challenging to estimate the probability of any one element being included in the sample including backgrounds experience levels or sectors
as result it is impossible to estimate sampling variability or to identify possible bias
journal of the international ombudsman association tyler smith the majority of oos who responded to the survey questionnaire had backgrounds in more than one academic discipline andor professional position
this factor made it impossible to look at oos from only one specific background
the study was properly adjusted to focus on differences between individuals with any amount of experience in particular area
final limitation is in the interpretation of the open ended question responses and calculation of frequencies for circumstances in which oos would explore the option of mediation
after categories were established and the researcher determined frequencies they were not tested by any other individual
it is possible that with the same categorical breakdowns and same responses different researcher would establish frequencies differently
new questions for future research if more academic and training programs in conflict resolution are made available and more conflict resolution professionals become interested in career as an will the path to becoming an become less nonsingular
additional questions relating to backgrounds and their practice might ho does particular academic of professional background help prepare someone for the role of the or enhance skill sets techniques
besides mediation ar other areas of practice influenced by an oos academic or profession al background
what other fac tors influence or inform an work in general or in particular areas
the survey questionnaire instrument used in this study collected qualitative data regarding other terminology used other than
further research might explore differences in understanding and in practice between formal mediation and informal mediation such as term that appeared often in survey questionnaire responses
additional questions relating to might what ar some of the reasons for why an would not explore the option of mediation or would instead make referral
an is involved in case that started as an case could should they later be acting as mediator if that case develops into mediation case even if the parties agree to that different role of an
several questions also emerged from the categorical breakdown developed in respect to circumstances in which an would explore the option of mediation
one question in particular stood out wh are some oos willing to mediate situations where there is an imbalance of power while others are much more reluctant
journal of the international ombudsman association tyler smith conclusion the findings in this study have confirmed and more specifically described the academic and professional backgrounds of some contemporary oos
in doing so the study has identified shifts and possible future trends in pathways to becoming an
the study has also demonstrated that mediation is explored more often than not by oos in cases where when more than one individual is involved
in terms of the circumstances under which oos explore mediation this study has identified several categories of consideration including the relationship the nature of the problem or concern the openness to mediation the options or alternative to mediation the mediation process benefits and the prospective mediation result
although some differences did exist the study did not establish any sweeping differences in the frequency or the circumstances in which mediation is explored amongst oos with different backgrounds
it is for further research to identify elements other than background and professional experience that influence practice

kathleen moore associate ombudsman national institutes of health bethesda maryland abstract the stage model of change and motivational interviewing from clinical therapies provide skills et to assist ombudsmen in the assessment and delivery of their work with individuals who seek their assistance
the stage model of change utilizes delineation of stages that can more precisely direct ombudsman strategy formulation matched with openness to change in the moment
motivational interviewing provides the general processes and tasks necessary to induce ombudsman client connection and develop deeper understanding of ambivalence and resistance so that the client can more easily identify and cross the barrier psychologically from the status quo to winning behavioral strategy
introduction when people need information they will often turn to the internet for definitions etiology and action steps to address or read about almost anything one can imagine
medical advice arcane trivia and broad reaching universal information are readily available
but when people find themselves in workplace conflict this kind of unidimensional information will feel unsatisfactory at best and ineffective at worst
people contact an ombudsman because they want to articulate their concerns and connect with human being not just an informational resource
so from the beginning interaction is expected valued and indeed required to clarify problems identify interests and emotions and explore resolution
the author proposes incorporation of the stage model of change and motivational interviewing mi from the clinical behavioral psychotherapy literature to enhance ombudsmen delivery and efficacy in these areas of active listening diagnostic inquiry hypothesis formulation intervention and beyond to include continued professional learning and discovery
this author will refer to the person who contacts the ombudsman as either the client or the visitor and will use the terms interchangeably to mean the individual with whom the ombudsman is working
kathleen moore the use of the stage model of change and mi were first formulated in the early for addictions treatment miller
since that time these evidence based models have been adapted successfully from addiction to health behavior mental health care cardiovascular rehabilitation diabetes management and chronic pain eg with patients who do not want to reduce their medications and increase their activity level because to do so is painful
mi has also been shown to change physician attitudes about patient resistance
there appears to be synergy between clinician and client utterances which increases clinician interpersonal skill and attitudes about outcome in addition to producing more effective outcomes
this discovery particularly may translate effectively into ombudsman practice
both the stage model of change and mi have been empirically proven in over randomized clinical control trials miller et al
to have utility that can be used with anyone when people are ambivalent about anything in their life that they want to change whether medical or work related
adaptation of the skill sets utilized in these models may assist the ombudsman in those difficult cases in which client ambivalence resistance or other factors seem to stall change and confound the ombudsman and client alike
incorporating this orientation borrowed from clinical work into daily routine practice may deepen ombudsman effectiveness improve case outcomes and lead to increased satisfaction with the intervention for both the client and ombudsman
it is bit like walking backwards one arrives at the destination whether you walk forward or backwards but the brain has to work differently in backwards gait and the individual experiences different sensory input and thought processes along the way
it may prove to be difference that makes the difference
this paper will first provide an overview of ombudsmen principles and processes that inform the culture of the ombudsman role
will then define the stage model of change and motivational interviewing mi and suggest implications for ombudsman practice
the ombudsman role organizational ombudsmen serve as confidential independent neutral and informal dispute resolution sources for specific entity
as such they are accessible to defined population and can advocate for fairness within that population
this unique combination of characteristics distinguishes the organizational ombudsman from classical ombudsmen mediators arbitrators and other alternative dispute resolution professionals
mediators for example may practice guided by similar principles as ombudsmen but ombudsmen serve as inside and are able to weave together with the permission information from the perspective information regarding the work place directly from others within the organization as well as incorporate systems specific information that may be impacting the circumstances and finally provide ongoing contact with the employee and the organizational unit of which he she is part
this wider scope carries the potential to create deeper engagement and interventions that morph over time as the individual makes changes or as the organizational reality changes
ombudsmen often begin each session with new visitor with an initial interview
this activity can be described as listening fully and actively so that the ombudsman understands the perspective as he or she describes the for which he or she requests assistance
the international ombudsman association standards of practice state that the ombudsman functions on an informal neutral and impartial basis by providing and receiving information journal of the international ombudsman
kathleen moore identifying and reframing issues developing range of responsible options and with permission and at ombudsman discretion engaging in informal third party intervention
when possible the ombudsman helps people develop new ways to solve problems international ombudsman association
ombudsman work by its nature dictates problem solving approach aimed at developing mutual scope for the work and identifying necessary steps to achieve the goals agreed upon by both the client and ombudsman
theoretical positions generally fall into two large categories with various subcategories those that emphasize either increased understanding of the person and other parties in conflict or those that emphasize an orderly and respectful exchange of proposed solutions geared toward resolution or settlement
the two main camps can generally be conceptualized as promoting dialogue toward increased insight as goal with merit of its own without achievement of settlement or primary focus and push toward resolution or settlement
in actual practice hybrid of the two general approaches may be found
for example kenneth kr es sel and howard gad lin outlined model utilized by one large organizational ombudsman office that incorporated kind of two step approach encompassing both
ombudsmen in this study initially approached the individual with overtures toward deep problem solving schema dp ss aimed at identifying and addressing underlying sources of conflict and converted to tactical schema ts focusing on the issues as identified by the parties and eschewing the examination of only if the attempts at dp ss were
sometimes the parties are unwilling or unable to proceed in deep problem solving interchange they may desire more concrete tactical resolution or be unwilling or unable to reflect in deeper way
howard gad lin states that or not we offer problem depends on the sort of working relationship we establish with the parties
this in turn is often direct consequence of the questions we ask and the questions we ask do flow from the overall conceptual scheme we bring to the for example in mentor post doc dispute we ask about or offer thoughts about separation and authority issues by using parental the ombudsman would follow tactical driven strategy in deference to the pragmatic scientific and agenda of scientific director even when systemic problems might have favored deep problem solving approach
in another instance deep problem solving strategy was employed to modify dysfunctional communication pattern between mentor and scientifically weak postdoctoral fellow but only enough to negotiate an early termination of the
in workplace settings employees generally contact the organizational ombudsman with concerns regarding fair treatment performance evaluations conduct actions and other communication problems among colleagues or supervisors
often too people contact the ombudsman with requests for facilitation or group work to examine systems processes or develop strategic plans for change management
because of this defined area of interest namely the workplace in its various singles dia ds triads and groups the client comes to share elements related to his or her thoughts about how he she has been treated and information regarding how he she has functioned in this environment which can aid in planning the scope of the work with the client
in addition to the direct report of the client ombudsmen often have direct access to information regarding the visitor from people in the work place
with the permission the ombudsman may contact appropriate others supervisors colleagues or subordinates to understand important relational or operational factors in the department that impact him or her
the journal of the international ombudsman
kathleen moore ombudsman is thus in the advantageous position of being able to ask for permission to talk with appropriate others so that the ombudsman and client together can with permission by the parties share information and analyze reject or incorporate these diverse viewpoints into the assessment and decision making the process is thus discovery driven and interactive
in addition the ombudsman has direct knowledge of institutional systemic factors that provide the context within which the problems and issues exist
by contrast personal coaches private therapists or trusted confidants might have general knowledge about such factors from the perspective but are not likely to have institution specific information
this comprehensive knowledge and the ability to examine and integrate this kind of information in shared explorative discussion are the true hallmarks of the uniqueness and value of the role
stage theory of change conceptual backdrop focusing on theories of change is important because many people who visit the ombudsman find themselves in painful situations sometimes without clear idea how they arrived there and with secret or not so secret misgiving that they cannot fix it themselves
they turn to others to help them make it better
this may be supervisor director human resources person or ombudsman who the person feels might provide shred of clarity or perhaps even save the day
an important consideration in ombudsmen practice is to first strive to understand the situation as the person sees it to really pause and spend enough time in an empathetic way that allows the person to articulate his her predicament so that the ombudsman fully grasps the hardship involved
it is crucial not to rush this process because all that follows is predicated on the development of successful connection at this juncture
as basic level of trust and connection have been established the ombudsman can assist the person to gently expand and complexify the narrative by asking detailed questions about it to probe more specifically about what the person wants evaluate the decisions he she made in the past that may have contributed to the circumstance in some way and to help him her imagine choices that are better for them
as the ombudsman shifts into the action required to achieve these choices the ombudsman can help direct the process by tentatively proposing solutions that mesh with an capacity and commitment to assume personal agency in the desired change
this requires deeper artistry on the part of the ombudsman
the types of questions the ombudsman considers and asks should create sense of reciprocity between ombudsman and client regarding what to expect in the professional encounter
questions would likely include those that uncover and structure continuum of choice points for the client and ombudsman alike first pause to consider all the complexities suffering and pathways that are embedded in the present circumstance understand the at io nale of the past decision making as well as articulating the preferred future on sider improvements in conflict management or communication skills and anticipate potential down sides and advantages ambivalence regarding acting on these improvements discuss str ate gies that may encompass either coaching with ombudsman to prepare for direct conversation with other parties in order to communicate his her view andor perhaps allow permission for the ombudsman to contact significant parties who may have information or authority to facilitate changes journal of the international ombudsman
kathleen moore on sider benefits of other options such as shuttle diplomacy or mediation or decide take no action at the current time
every choice point within this continuum requires that the individual him or herself generate decisions to either convert thoughts or desire for change into some kind of behavioral action or not
the interaction with the ombudsman can serve not only as an information gathering session for possible options but serve as catalyst for the individual to assess his her ability and desire to convert wish for different circumstance into behaviors to make it possible
making these kinds of choices can be difficult and unfamiliar
it is sometimes the case that clients are not always ready to reflect on their contributions to situation or consider making changes that will lead to more effective functioning and resolution of conflict
they may not feel it is necessary they may be anxious or fearful about this kind of reflection or they may believe the best course of action is to change others instead
the stage model of change derived from the counseling paradigm is applicable to ombudsman practice in making these assessments about the situation
it is based on the theory that clients move through series of stages of willingness to change and that tasks and challenges presented by each of the stages of change require different techniques and proposals from the ombudsman
this does not imply that visitors are somehow stubbornly and consciously unwilling to change and therefore are the main causes of the problems they face although this may at times be true
it means that ombudsmen can more effectively understand that the influence of the environment within which the person lives works and loves has left an imprint on the situational capacity in that moment for change to occur
it is therefore important to understand that ombudsmen have very real opportunity to thoughtfully assess right along with the visitor where the person finds him or herself in terms of imagining change and work with the visitor to correlate options that are most likely to be of benefit to the visitor given his her change capacity at the time
according to conn ors et al
there are five stages of change precontemplation contemplation practice action and maintenance
in the precontemplation stage the client is really not motivated to change
during this stage techniques should not be geared toward behavioral change but rather toward increased education as to the effects of the problem behavior in the life
in the contemplation stage the client begins to consider change seriously and the focus of the intervention is working with the client to elucidate the pros and cons of change
in the preparation stage the focus of the work is planning action steps and commitment enhancement as well as identification of strategies to move successfully into action
review and checkup on the skills needed to implement these strategies is essential
in the action stage the plan that was developed in the practice stage is activated
the need for commitment is crucial and review and revision are important tasks in the action phase as the client makes changes in behavior and
he maintenance stage requires continued monitoring of the action outcomes to ensure they remain useful and healthy
kathleen moore stage of change items precontemplation far as concerned have any problems that need changing
guess have faults but nothing really need to change
contemplation think might be ready for some self improvement
wish had more ideas on how to solve my problem
action am finally doing some on my situation
an yo ne can talk about changing am actually doing something about it
maintenance not following through with what had already changed as well as had hoped and here to prevent relapse of the problem
thought once had resolved the problem would be free of it but sometimes find myself struggling with it
the ombudsman would work differently with someone who does not currently view his or her behavior as contributing to problem and is primarily focused on exacting change from others than they would with someone who is more self reflective and ready to discuss personal options to remedy the situation
in the former instance the work would be an educational approach asking series of questions to determine whether the behavior is producing deleterious consequences in his or her life
ombudsman thus attempts to increase the awareness of the potential problems caused consequences experienced and risks faced as result of the behavior in question
in the later instance the approach would be behaviorally oriented and would include discussing options for action activities to enhance commitment and personal skills necessary to implement desired change
ideally counselors or ombudsmen help clients envision better future and become increasingly motivated to achieve brodie et al
way the strategy seeks to help clients think differently about their behavior and ultimately to consider what might be gained through et al
central concept is that ambivalence about decisions is resolved by conscious or unconscious weighing of pros and cons of change vs
it is not that people know what to do but rather that they often feel stuck and have confidence to act in the way they say they want to
when anyone is ambivalent about situation they begin to feel pressure and often experience pressure from others who are important in their lives
in this situation we often question ourselves is the deal
the way in which client thinks about the work related problems will likely yield clues for consideration
the following questions which guide the internal assessment can assist the ombudsman in arriving at sense of the sense of agency and locus of control
oes the client see his her part in creating his her own problems
is the client ware of alternatives for action
oes the client recognize and try to deal with problems or invest energy in denying their existence
oes the client generally blame others for his her problems
is the client willing consult and work with someone to change the behavior
kathleen moore utilizing the questions above as template for hypothesis formulation will help the ombudsman understand the functioning on continuum of self awareness reality testing and willingness to engage in the change process and suggest options accordingly
for example imagine the following presentation was referred by my supervisor for anger management but have problem
had to set these guys straight and pull out of the project
the other collaborators are way off base with their
here the ombudsman might wonder to herself whether the person will continue to blame the other collaborators whether the person will invest energy in resolving the matter and whether the person is willing to work with the ombudsman to change his behavior or the outcome
she may also wonder whether the person is stalled by ambivalence feeling or thoughts that define mixture of strong competing emotions
for example might there be blend of anger for not being appreciated or maybe frustration because the project may not finish in time or fear that the expertise is not adequate and he may not receive good evaluation
the ombudsman may not ask these questions directly or she might but in any case she would lead the conversation to an opening so that the person could express any conflicting thought or emotions
this is accomplished in conversational not interrogatory way and the ombudsman infers from the verbal responses and physical cues whether or not the person is interested in an alternative way of looking at the situation
motivational interviewing miller defines motivational interviewing as form of collaborative conversation for strengthening own motivation and commitment to
it provides skills et that is consistent with the stage model of change and can guide and deepen the orientation to the client his or her interviewing skills hypothesis formulation and intervention strategies
mi is method that is evidence based relatively brief specifiable and applicable across wide variety of problem areas complementary to other active intervention methods and learnable by broad range of helping professionals
although originally developed to address substance abuse disorders mi has now been tested across diverse spectrum of target behaviors and found to be effective both in reducing maladaptive behavior and promoting adaptive health behavior change
it shows promise as tool to be integrated with other ombudsman methods for use when client ambivalence and motivation appear to be obstacles to miller
mi is unique in that it is nonexpert based model
the ombudsman as is in different relationship with the client from the very beginning
even as the ombudsman might fully listen in order to understand the perspective and lead client through option discussions with the goal of coming to decision for action all of which an ombudsman does and all of which are positive the ombudsman does not approach the client as an expert but rather as someone who has equal responsibility to put something into the discussion as the client equally has something to contribute
this is nuanced difference from the ombudsman as in conflict resolution whose purpose is to listen well and understand deeply but essentially to give advice or construct solutions as though the ombudsman possessed some special knowledge of the organization that would magically lend itself to solution without the contribution and reflection
indeed it may sometimes be the case that the ombudsman is aware of particular facts about the organization that may influence which options are viable
in this case the ombudsman must delicately explore the feasibility of options with the client
the role and indeed gift lies in the creation of journal of the international ombudsman
kathleen moor ea certain kind of psychological safety through an empathic direction during the work that is more likely to reduce the inherent risk of self reflection self disclosure and imagined positive outcomes
this in turn better enables the client to dial down defensive or protective thoughts that may be restricting him or her internally so as to better tune into his or her interests emotions and history of decision making all factors in self opting for behavioral change
is designed to strengthen an motivation for and movement toward specific goal by eliciting and exploring the own reasons for change within an atmosphere of acceptance and rather than one of challenge investigation or overly structured dialogue
it is thus joint exploration between visitor and ombudsman of the full range of factors that contribute or impede the visitor from making desired change
the mi model mi is conceptual model focused on responding differentially to client speech within generally empathic person centered style with special attention focused on evoking and strengthening the own verbalized motivations for miller
it is intervention style for eliciting behavior change by helping clients to explore and resolve any bits or chunks of ambivalence the visitor may harbor that impede achievement of his her goals
the mi model distinguishes itself from solution focused brief therapy cognitive therapies and ombudsman coaching models with its emphasis on both relational and technical components
other therapies and coaching models do not emphasize the interdependent nature of these components and have not to date provided empirical data to support their approaches in the way that mi has done
these empirical findings can provide more solid theoretical marker of validity for ombudsmen as they work with visitors throughout all stages of the work
the components are applicable to all issues found within the nine international ombudsman association uniform reporting categories
mi emphasizes two specific active components first is relational component focused on the interpersonal spirit of mi more specifically the therapeutic skill of empathic understanding as described by carl rogers
rogers hypothesized that accurate empathy and congruence provide supportive and facilitative atmosphere in which clients can safely explore their experience and ambivalence and are and interpersonal conditions for fostering change
these relational factors have been empirically shown to promote positive change in problem drinking and other medical treatment outcomes miller miller et al
in fact counselor empathy has been shown to account for meaningful proportion of variance in therapeutic alliance
high empathy counselors appear to have higher success rates regardless of theoretical orientation and low empathy counselors produced toxic effect on outcomes of treatment moy ers miller
technical component involves the differential evocation and reinforcement of client change talk
miller maintains this approach is linked to prior psychological theories such as formulation of cognitive dissonance in which he postulates the change promoting value of hearing oneself argue for change and with reformulation as self perception theory
kathleen examination and resolution of ambivalence is central purpose and the mi counselor is intentionally directive in pursuing this shannon et al
counter change arguments commonly referred to as resistance represent the other side of ambivalence to which the counselor expects may be present probes for its effects and responds shannon et al
ambivalence and resistance create indecision because they represent strong opposing thoughts or emotions
neither ambivalence nor resistance should be perceived as dysfunction or individual weakness nor should register to the ombudsman in any way as critique or negative assessment of the visitor
they are viewed as supportive markers used to illuminate the situation for the visitor and ombudsman alike and to sketch out more adaptive outcomes that take into account individual patterns of ambivalence
technical and relational components are not rival or incompatible hypotheses
psychotherapy research has long postulated combination of specific technical and general or nonspecific relational factors that influence
am rhe im classification scheme based on analysis of language by which people negotiate and make commitments
he differentiated change talk into linguistic subcategories reflecting various components of motivation for change desire ability reasons and need all precursors to commitment
the strength of commitment directly and robustly predicted behavior change while the other subcategories seemed to be preparatory steps toward commitment
foreshadowing this pattern mi occurs in two phases
phase one counselor focuses on evoking change talk to elicit intrinsic motivation for change
when sufficient motivation seems to be present the counselor shifts to phase two strengthening commitment to change focusing on converting motivation into commitment to specific change goals and plans
skilled mi counselor attends and responds to such insession fluctuations in change talk and resistance and would not press ahead with the agenda if the client were not coming along
if the counselor disregarded or confronted client resistance at these points motivational momentum would be
mi skills translated into ombudsman practice four general processes are involved in mi engaging focusing evoking and planning
within these four processes are eight tasks that provide framework for learning motivational interviewing and incorporating the skills et into practice see appendix
the first three tasks are not as directive and are designed to gain the knowledge to learn more deeply from the person what is of most importance to them what the potential ambivalence may be about change and how to establish connection within the person from speculation about change to behavioral success implementing desired changes
the last five tasks are more interactive as the ombudsman shifts from recognizing change talk to more actively eliciting and strengthening change talk rolling with ambivalence and resistance to change developing change plan consolidating commitment and transition and blending
the following descriptions are taken directly from miller and moy ers found in appendix direct quotes are underlined for emphasis and clarity
overall spirit of mi most ombudsmen would describe their approach in way consistent with this task openness to way of thinking and working that is collaborative rather than prescriptive strengthens the autonomy and self direction is more about evoking than installing and exploring rather than explaining
client centered counseling skills mi requires proficiency in client centered counseling skills and the comfortable practice of oars miller moy ers
these include open ended questions not targeted simply to positions and interests of the party affirmation of the experience reflecting and reframing perspective and frequently shared summaries to hone impressions and deepen understanding
these skills are used strategically while focusing on variety of topics
development of these skills serve as reminders even to the most seasoned ombudsmen to loosen the grip on the steering wheel and stay focused on the client hesitations ebbs and flows of thought and emotion before jumping to familiar solutions all too early in the engagement
recognizing change talk ability to identify client and commitment language that signals movement in the direction of behavior change is critical to effective mi
it requires the recognition of preparatory change talk which includes expressions of desire ability reasons and need for change all of which favor increased strength of commitment of the client
these are discovered in the natural language utterances of client
training is required to fully learn the nuances of timing and response to client change talk but ombudsmen particularly in their coaching role are well placed to learn and respond in this deeper way
eliciting and strengthening change talk includes the ability to evoke and reinforce client change talk and commitment language
in this stage the client centered oars skills above are applied strategically to differentially strengthen change talk and commitment
for example change talk can be elicited by asking questions such as does interfere with things you would like to do
would you like things to be different
awareness alone is not generally sufficient for change and challenges to maintaining motivation and commitment should be expected and openly discussed as an active method to strengthen change talk
rolling with resistance is the ability to respond to client resistance in manner that reflects and respects it without reinforcing it
the essence is to roll with rather than opposing it
in ombudsman practice resistance behaviors might include making excuses for inaction blaming others minimizing importance or significance challenging hostile communication both verbal and nonverbal and ignoring
people who are resistant are not ready to change
ways to roll with the resistance include acknowledging the perception or disagreement with statements such as see need to change your think teamwork is really necessary at rather discouraged about trying to change your reaction to one hand you know there are some problems that can happen if you and the information suggested is not acceptable to
the following are examples one might routinely encounter in practic ea
client you help me get reassignment my supervisor just appreciate my efforts
ombudsman can support you with your efforts to create more positive situation
before we discuss steps you might take to find reassignment let me understand more
wonder if you might be weighing several sides to this situation probing for ambivalence and resistance
for example what might it take to feel your supervisor appreciates your efforts versus just walking away and starting over with different supervisor
or you were an outsider looking in what could potentially explain complexify ing and taking alternative perspectives in order to elicit change talk what is happening between you and your supervisor
client way could ever talk to my supervisor about this
she would retaliate by downgrading my performance and hold it against me that came to the
ombudsman like up until now change talk you have had this suspicion she would hold your attempts to work this out as negative rather than positive mark against you
can you share more details about how you came to that conclusion oars skills aimed at expanding details of the situation
under what conditions could you imagine sharing your concerns eliciting change talk to your supervisor that would surface the issue
finally another approach suggested by miller and roll nick to ask the client to take the position of arguing for change
the clinician argues the opposite point of view and asks the client to try to persuade the clinician to make the change
this gives the client the opportunity to list all the reasons why he she should miller and roll nick and roll nick et al
developing change plan this task marks the transition into phase of mi
it is the ability to recognize client readiness and to negotiate specific change plan that is acceptable and appropriate to the client
it involves acute clinical timing as well as expert negotiation skills
examples of statements that serve to evoke change talk into intentions and change plan include the following can see you are feeling stuck right now
what do you think you might be able to do
can see you feel unsure how to proceed right now
what is going to have to change
what might you be able to do
have you thought about talking to the other party individually
have you thought about raising your concerns with the appropriate formal official
have you thought about the disadvantages of maintaining the status quo
on scale from zero to ten how important is it for you to
tell me why you chose that number
what do you think might help you become more confident in making change
consolidating commitment requires the ability to elicit increasing strength of client commitment to change and to specific implementation intentions
reinforcing change talk might include responding with one of the following sounds like good
sounds like that could work you make good point can see you gave this lot of thought important for you now
transition and blending ombudsmen often blend intervention methods shifting from coaching to shuttle diplomacy or facilitation or mediation to settlement negotiations and back again in recursive not necessarily linear fashion
discussion ombudsman principles and practice currently parallel many of the skill sets found in the stage model of change and motivational interviewing approach
however the stage model of change provides useful delineation of stages of change that can more expertly inform ombudsman strategy formulation in casework
understanding that client may be in the precontemplation stage rather than an action or maintenance stage of change would direct the ombudsman to suggest and employ strategies empirically found to be useful in this particular stage rather than another
dialogue focused education and exploration during the precontemplation stage would look very different from outlining goals and behavioral steps needed to achieve those goals type of intervention predominant in the action stage
kathleen moore equally important the model reminds us that current motivation for change is not reflective of personality trait that rigidly describes person en to tale but reflects the social interactional system in which he or she finds oneself at the time
this is in alignment with the systems lens with which organizational ombudsmen formulate strategies for resolution in casework
mi can contribute even more comprehensively to help identify patterns and trends that point to systemic andor structural problems at various levels within the organization
acting within the bounds of permission and confidentiality this information may become part of upward feedback to organizational leaders as well as help sharpen the understanding of the organization and perhaps what types of education consultation outreach and support would most benefit the
the mi processes and descriptions of the tasks within these processes can provide guide for deepened practice for ombudsmen of any theoretical orientation
these tasks correspond with ombudsmen interventions but go beyond current ombudsman training and description of practice
coaching facilitation and mediation activities can all benefit from stretching the current models of practice to include the mi skills et
certainly the ability to recognize ambivalence resistance change talk and commitment language is applicable to effective interviewing in most all ombudsmen processes including coaching facilitation and mediation as well as in group work
eliciting and strengthening change talk can potentially augment the practice during these interventions and may lead to increased incidents of positive outcomes for the client and an enhanced skill repertoire for the ombudsman
regularly seeking and working with ambivalence is relatively new and often not incorporated in the ombudsman skill tool box
taking needed and often extra time to expect and explore client ambivalence is not the traditional ombudsman approach but doing so can strengthen rapport and understanding reduce anxiety and resistance and highlight crannies for creative solutions
rolling with resistance introduces another way to work with those cases in which the client or ombudsman seems stuck or at impasse
the ability to focus on understanding the perspective through reflective listening and evoking the own concerns is useful in all communication but never more so than when trying to help client recognize why he or she seem to make decision
confronting client ignoring resistance language or trying to influence client to advance to solutions discussion before he or she is ready seem to have the ironic adverse impact of strengthening the resistance
developing change plan is routine aspect of ombudsman practice and the mi model takes this stage to deeper level by witnessing and supporting the expressed values anxieties about successful implementation and previous history of decision making that may derail the commitment necessary for change behavior
the final task of transition and blending is particularly rallying point
ombudsmen are in unique role in their ability to blend an mi style with other methods and to transition flexibly with mi and ombudsman work
coaching is an integral aspect of almost all ombudsman activity leading sometimes to facilitation sometimes to shuttle diplomacy sometimes to group work and sometimes back again to simple journal of the international ombudsman
given the rather intimate engagement in the coaching relationship the ability to deeply understand potential ambivalence stimulate commitment for action and strengthen action steps depends on creating both relational and technical bonds with the client
it behooves the ombudsman to understand the possibility that in some cases this deeply personal and empathic regard may surface information about pressing family problems or even their own medical issues
indeed personal or medical issues may be large factors in ambivalence creating indecision
if so it can require an elegant and compassionate referral to other resources such as an employee assistance program or own health care provider while maintaining own professional boundaries and focus for the work
internal ombudsmen often provide training on conflict resolution topics such as negotiation effective performance feedback and crucial communication but there is currently no unified and valid evaluation component of ombudsman training
the predominant assumption is that employees will benefit from an interactive workshop and that they can then apply what they have learned to improve their workplace communication and negotiation ability
this assertion could be challenged and addressed by applying the effective evaluation and research design from already established mi studies
for example recent data miller mount rub el so bell miller that while clinicians reported high satisfaction and significant self perceived gains in proficiency after an mi workshop tape recorded work samples before and after training reflected only modest changes in practice
the workshop seemed to have convinced clinicians they had acquired mi skillfulness but their actual practice did not change enough to make difference to their
this may signify an interesting and important theoretical and research question for further study
ombudsman training could be enhanced as mi training has been modified over time to include additional one on one coaching and regular skill development support so that the skills would prove more quantifiable and sustainable
for those ombudsmen who are not internal to the organization they serve and who helicopter into facilitation and mediation cases mi can provide methodology with which to delve more deeply into the relational aspects of the case rather than singular focus on the technicalities of settlement
in these cases the ombudsman mediator can help the clients analyze the situation from more nuanced perspective and help develop an action plan to address not only the positions and interests on the negotiation agenda but potentially relieve interpersonal tensions by nudging personal efforts for understanding that have surfaced during the discussions
furthermore the individual may learn from what has happened in the conflict and subsequent resolution to better identify and prevent future recurrences of the same type
research in mi suggests that the principles are indeed generalizable to other professions when anyone is working with someone experiencing ambivalence about making change in his or her work or personal life
incorporation of the mi approach in ombudsman casework could lead to more durable evidence based theory of ombudsman practice
testable theory now exists to examine these components empirically
kathleen moore appendix tasks in learning motivational interviewing overall spirit of mi openness to way of thinking and working that is collaborative rather than prescriptive honors the autonomy and self direction and is more about evoking than installing
this involves at least willingness to suspend an authoritarian role and to explore client capacity rather than incapacity with genuine interest in the experiences and perspectives not simply his her positions or interests
client centered counseling skills proficiency in client centered counseling skills to provide supportive and facilitative atmosphere in which clients can safely explore their experience and ambivalence
this involves the comfortable practice of open ended questions affirmation summaries and particular the skill of accurate empathy as described by carl rogers
recognizing change talk and resistance ability to identify client and commitment language that signals movement in the direction of behavior change as well as client resistance
preparatory change talk includes expressions of desire ability reasons need for change which favor increased strength of commitment
eliciting and strengthening change talk ability to evoke and reinforce client change talk and commitment language
here the practice of open ended questioning affirmations frequent summaries and accurate empathy skills are applied strategically to differentially strengthen change talk and commitment
rolling with resistance ability to respond to client sustain talk or resistance in manner that reflects and respects without reinforcing it
the essence is to roll with rather than opposing resistance
developing change plan making the transition into phase of mi
ability to recognize client readiness and to negotiate specific change plan that is acceptable and appropriate to the client
this involves acute timing as well as negotiation skills
consolidating commitment ability to elicit increasing strength of client commitment to change and to specific implementation intentions
transition and blending ability to blend an mi style with the other intervention methods and to transition flexibly between mi and other approaches

adjunct professor of negotiation and conflict management institute for work and employment research mit sloan school of management justine sen tenne pioneer ombudsman at can adai asked justine sen tenne did you come from as an organizational ombudsman pioneer
she told me that she was the youngest child among the eight girls born to sen tenne and
her mother was from holy oke massachusetts and her father from montreal
she described household full of faith in god love of country open dialogue and aiming at excellence in life
she said she led charmed and happy childhood surrounded with much loving laughing exploring learning receiving
she loved the from older sisters
she described challenging experiences where avenue was open and
justine academic career included bilingual education with business college at the mother house university at the du and mc gill and an from
her long career started in business fresh out of commercial college
she gravitated to the world of finance and then politics
she was the first woman in the city of history to become member of the executive committee
later she turned to teaching volunteering and other pursuits before spending years as corporate ombudsman at
retiring as organizational ombudsman justine feels she her dream of playing meaningful role in
we then turned to questions about her work at
what was the impetus in developing the role at
was approached by large utility composed of many different entities that were merged and then nationalized by the provincial government
labor relations had been problematic with work stoppages strikes and conflicts of all kinds throughout less than half existence
this had prompted analysis and evaluation of potential solutions by successive management teams
in the late new study was extensive it included many resources both internal and external
with workforce of about employees most of whom were unionized into many different locals in dealing with grievances of white collar workers there seemed to be no mechanism in place with which to build credibility and eliminate fear of reprisal
an apparent lack of fairness in the situation made the case for having neutral third party to hear complaints
journal of the international ombudsman association mary ro we document was given as an introduction to my role revealed that numerous drafts had circulated asking for neutral third party
the input came from many sources personnel human resources legal financial and others
authorities decided to create the role of organizational ombudsman along the lines of the prote cte ur du citoyen du the provincial ombudsman
was told the initial focus was on finding senior director of personnel human resources close to retirement age who might accept the role on part time contractual basis for days week
my perception was that the corporation wanted to foster acceptance of new style of management
they wanted to dispel any notion of malaise at the heart of this initiative
it was then that the board of directors named me to the newly created position of protect rice de la person ne the corporate ombudsman
what were some early events andor developments that provided foundation for the evolution of your role
great deal of attention was paid to the need and importance of the position of ombudsman
then the sent letter to each rank and file employee unionized or not
it announced my nomination by the board of directors and spelled out the extent and limits of my role
it stated quite clearly that had only the of recommendation to the decision was final and
the way forward was thus clearly laid out
this initial act by top management did three thing si acknowledged the needs for neutral third party in conflict resolution and to improve the workplace environment
ii highlighted management commitment and resolve in finding solutions to labor relations problems of all kinds
iii cemented the direct link of the organizational ombudsman to top management and enabled the with investigative powers throughout the firm
in the initial months and much to my amazement discovered that one of my greatest assets in building credibility was the fact was an outsider with no ties to anyone or anything within the firm
upon my arrival was given free rein to develop the office as saw fit
my priority was to choose proper staff and ensure that confidentiality privacy objectivity and independence were respected
it became apparent very early on that needed resources and that they had to be part of my contractual arrangement
was allowed to avail myself of internal and external legal advice and counsel from experts in the field
this initial step proved important not only for my wellbeing but as near ironclad protection when my role was questioned or tested in the courts
what challenges did you face in implementing your role
my recollections of the challenges are twofold ignorance and suspicion
having myself felt ignorance concerning the role when was first contacted by the person heading the search had great sympathy for those who seemed baffled by my presence and my role
not surprisingly those who had little knowledge of the role were the most suspicious of the need for creating new position in the firm and they were the most reluctant to welcome my presence
journal of the international ombudsman association mary ro we however my biggest asset in meeting employees one on one or in special groups was my independence from the line organization and my independence from particular policy directives in any department
it became evident that was not an employee of the firm
had no benefits no paid holidays vacations pension plan nor any other such recognition
this perception gave me an idea for firm position adopted at the start of my work as an ombudsman that of not fraternizing with employees
wanted to enshrine my third party status
on the elevator or walking in the office building or outside kept to myself and never engaged in conversation had lunch or otherwise with employees
this also became directive for whoever worked in my office
who were key colleagues and allies outside your organization
in my first interviews it was made clear to me that the candidate would be selected for his or her generalist experience
however having been in various workplace and academic situations in my prior career moves once knew had been accepted in the position of ombudsman was able to tap personal contacts for information and basic advice
former colleagues and mentors were very willing and helpful in orienting initial steps and in building up my self confidence
also was most fortunate to have access to professors and other persons who became source of strength for me in the first two or three months of my life as an ombudsman
remember making telephone calls to professor mary ro we an mit ombudsman and to james professor and author of book entitled organizational troubleshooters
the two calls introduced me to the world of ombudsmen and the corporate ombudsman association
from this time forward felt had sense of belonging to and met persons who were instrumental in enabling me to do good job as an ombudsman
the impetus provided by this association with likeminded colleagues was cornerstone of my ability to work and grow in my role and to make it user friendly within the firm
locally because had no role model in canada and had not been in the business of dealing with people who were dissatisfied with their situation at work reached out to those who were already in similar mode of work
these were in agencies where people bore different titles other than ombudsman such as commissioner and in other areas such as the financial sector
being in montreal city with universities and many other health agencies and hospitals who had an ombudsman or similar individuals handling problem situations reached out to these colleagues
formed an informal association that met to discuss topics and learn from experts in various fields
this exchange was very beneficial and resulted in helpful network of persons interested in furthering the profession and in sharing experiences
at the outset made it very clear that these were to be closed door meetings that all sensitive information stayed within the walls of the conference room and that mutual trust and confidentiality were key to our success
was fortunate that during my time as ombudsman with the firm many ombudsman meetings were held under its auspices and on its premises
the enthusiasm and approval of my and his management team were steadfast and continued with many successive administrations
journal of the international ombudsman association mary ro we
what did colleagues in the organization assume your role to be
did that affect the way you worked
entering workplace of employees with very large upper management team my status was puzzling to many so called colleagues
many of my first visitors thought that my role would somehow be that of an advocate for their cause
they were quite startled when explained that was an advocate for while acting as neutral third party and looking at both sides of the problem
on my first day as corporate ombudsman letter was sent to each person in the firm announcing my arrival setting out the parameters of my role and asking everyone for their cooperation to help fulfill my mandate
this became the best calling card could ever have hoped for
people were surprised to see that although was not an employee of the firm had dotted line of responsibility to the person at the highest level in organization the chairman of the board who was also the chief executive officer
initially in my first few weeks as ombudsman felt needed to make some formal recommendations to the to bolster credibility among employees and managers although of course was able to decide when this was required
my target stake holders were those in non unionized positions
sometimes problem was such that could do fact finding analysis in terms of relevant rules and guidelines
but sometimes the root cause of problem was personality conflict
this required thinking outside the box to offer solution
as it happened within the first month of assuming the role of ombudsman was confronted with an important case of harassment
after numerous meetings at the workplace and elsewhere and taking all available information into account made strong recommendation to my about the matter
this unfortunate incident helped me to develop distinct image within the firm my reputation grew quite rapidly as result
the case confirmed my inner perception of need to react quickly and boldly in the resolution of complaints like this that can be damaging to the entire workforce
in addition the delicate part of dealing with each individual involved in such cases revealed to me the great importance of working to insure that there would be no reprisals
during the long painstaking period before became ombudsman ownership of this process was in the hands of trusted senior manager in human resources personnel
after my appointment to the position of ombudsman besides providing me with past history he became kind mentor and taught me many important things related to my new profession
first decision was choosing my then secretary pauline
she very quickly became trusted administrative assistant and dear friend
she accepted the challenge and also was bound by secrecy and confidentiality was very fortunate
her knowledge of administrative matters and key persons in many departments were invaluable
the warm welcome she extended to all visitors made great impact on the overall perception of the office of the ombudsman
journal of the international ombudsman association mary ro we it was pleasant surprise to find support and encouragement from various persons when made presentations or inquiries in certain units
discovered many members of senior management vice presidents directors managers union representatives and consultants who shared the vision of more equitable workplace and were helpful in solving workplace problems
over the years although did not seek out friends in the firm did make few acquaintances who proved to be trustworthy understanding and respectful of my role
was quite fortunate to have many dealings with the medical team the security unit the information computer specialists the senior staff in the benefits and payroll as well in the personnel area in all divisions of the firm
enjoyed their trust and appreciated the general interest and concern they showed in cases pertaining to individuals with personal difficulties and serious health issues
today feel that without their assistance in difficult situations dealt with would not have been able to bring proper conclusion to some very serious cases
my being able to refer some employees to adequate counseling was crucial in resolving some cases
what kind of cases did you see at first
how did these characteristics change over time
in anticipation of being an ombudsman at the firm had vague idea of longstanding concerns
the first line managers at the firm were in loose association and had demanded the right to present some cases to my office since they felt the need for closer attention to their plight
in certain divisions when job opening occurred the right of first refusal for position in this category had been deemed to be that of member of this association
in many cases for the sake of expediency another candidate was chosen without any further consideration
the very first case presented to me was by the president of the association of first line managers of the firm
made recommendation to the to allow the accepted process to go forward to ensure the selection of candidate who was member of the association and fully entitled to obtain his rightful position
in accepting my recommendation the sent strong signal within the firm that immediately conferred certain degree of credibility and legitimacy to my role
the first conference attended was in cincinnati ohio in the early
it proved very valuable to me
learned that our role as ombudsman in our organizations made us to corporate entities of what was brewing within our own firms
looking back now see even more clearly how true that was
learning of problems at lower levels in the firm and solving them quickly through the cooperation of all the stake holders prevented much more serious situations later on and at more sensitive level
it was heartwarming for me with very limited experience in the field as an ombudsman to meet colleagues who had experienced similar workplace problems and could pass on ways of solving them
eventually our cy ber world became reality and our economic social and personal world presented new problems
this has made new business imperatives necessary for management and workers living through sometimes dramatic events
the presence of workplace violence and bullying continues to rear its ugly head
new problems are being identified such as pt sd an illness not exclusive to the military but now even in our call centres which are vital to the firm
journal of the international ombudsman association mary row eon the positive side feel it is extraordinary to see how quickly and expertly answers to our some of our most difficult problems can be found and implemented
the vast network of information which is now so easily accessible provides new approaches to human problems that can now be discovered much more quickly
however there has to be mutual trust and acceptance of to produce responses to these new queries
this raised the question in my mind of how to make the role of ombudsman more relevant
in previous career was financial analyst
as such belonged to an association which gave formal training and gave certification of this professional status
the more thought about being an ombudsman the more it became apparent that there was need for better public recognition of the importance of the profession of ombudsman
this entailed the necessity for structural certification process within our association
am delighted to have seen the realization of this through efforts and the perseverance and dedication of its to have become certified
how did the development of professional associations eg
at the outset seeking professional model was very strong motivation for me to join professional association
upon learning of the existence of the corporate ombudsman association became member
throughout my career as ombudsman participated as much as could in various activities seminars web in ars and was also privileged to sit on many committees and become member of the board of directors of the ombudsman association
particularly enjoyed attending the annual conferences and training seminars and the east coast om buds group ec og meetings
valued highly the peer contact and always came away supercharged with new ideas and new friends
as more and more canadians became ombudsman felt need for new platform to exchange ideas and treat certain canadian aspects facing our daily work
this sentiment took root at vancouver joint ombudsmen conference and culminated in the incorporation of the forum of canadian ombudsmen
am proud to have been on the board of directors of this new association and appreciated efforts put forward by my colleagues to achieve this milestone in the growth of the ombudsman profession in canada
somehow within the local community and the firm itself the creation of this new entity brought greater degree of acceptance and respect for the ombudsman
at the start it required extra work to ensure its viability and my colleagues and devoted many volunteer hours to this new endeavour
suzanne bels on of the con cordia university and department of national defence ombudsman offices led group of many volunteers in developing training programs and conferences focussed on canadian needs and content
in our canadian experience it seemed to me that there was great deal of difficulty for ombudsmen to obtain financial assistance to attend meetings travel and be absent from the office
since brought the training sessions to many parts of the country this facilitated access and reduced expenses to the ombudsman community from coast to coast
journal of the international ombudsman association mary ro we looking back at all these years of growing into the role of ombudsman as the profession itself was taking off think that the opportunity for networking which was my lifeline at the start and continued later on was huge factor in establishing the presence of ombudsmen everywhere
it was always pleasant to answer questions concerning the profession from government agencies startup companies or large conglomerates and to learn sometime later the name of the person appointed to the role of ombudsman
for instance in montreal was approached by few international legal firms to help them structure the position of ombudsman in their own firms
many others sought my advice and opinion on the prospect of developing the position within their own organ is at ions
all these events made more and more members of the community aware and appreciative of the work of the ombudsman
however there is still much work to do
here in canada our efforts to have an ombudsman for all canadians is not yet reality at the federal level
we have tried time and time again to present our case particularly since one provincial ombudsman was member of the federal cabinet at time when we were actively involved in getting public support for this project
however am confident that we are not too far away from getting this new position in our federal administration
which major events issues have impacted on your work and role in recent years
would say terrorism of course since september
otherwise moral harassment bullying emotional distress violence in the workplace and diversification of the work force with the advent of retiring and new immigrants arriving
what strikes me most is the overwhelming sense of distress witnessed at the end of my mandate
the toll that bullying has wrought is very high
it leaves long lasting effects in work units across the firm even after so called environment has been restored
the scarring takes on different form in each work area where it is detected
the personal toll assumed by the targeted employee adds to the mental health statistics and taints whole category of employees and managers in sly and subtle manner
this generation of workers usually have the comfort of stability of employment
on the contrary change is all it has known and sometimes the adaptation required by change is not only difficult it can also be nearly impossible
when such visitor came to my door he or she felt it was safe haven and place of peace where the inner self was able to articulate some of the most terrible and inhumane acts committed
the visitor felt he or she was trapped and had to struggle to be free of this stigma without any help from anyone else at times even blaming themselves for that extreme situation
found it strange that the more employees and managers there are in an organisation such as my firm the more difficult it appeared to find sympathetic ear or even at times shoulder to cry on
it became more and more common for targeted employees to withdraw from the workplace and suffer the discomfort and suffering in silence
discovered that the skill set of the ombudsman that plays the biggest role in these cases is that of listening
it is often constant exercise in humility forcing the ombudsman to be devoid of any prejudice favorable or unfavorable and to accept and receive the message as it is spoken and in its entirety
it is amazing what solutions come to mind when confronted with journal of the international ombudsman association mary ro we these difficult cases after hearing both sides in the problem
oftentimes if the outcome is too slow and wrought with red tape the victim may decide to act alone and bring unto himself and others tragedy and grief
the media culture is dangerous in this context of exposing us all to each incident of difficult nature
was pleased to note reinforced security force at strategic physical locations throughout the geographical area covered by the organisation as it showed employees and managers that there was zero tolerance policy against violence and other such events
how do you see the future of the profession
am very optimistic about the future of our profession
think there are still many bridges to cross in order to gain wider acceptance of the role of the ombudsman and its place in any organisation
also budgetary considerations need to be recast we should signal to top management everywhere that there are economies of scale to be made by ensuring proper and fair treatment of all employees
too often it appears that the first positions to be axed by firms in financial difficulties are in the office of the ombudsman
this shortsighted view will probably cost these organ is at ions much more in years to come when it realizes the negative impact on its workforce and underlying distrust of those in higher places
as our profession grows we must ensure that our ombudsman organ is at ions continue to provide the best service to members forever
ombudsmen pioneers international agencies challenges opportunities
am especially grateful to jim hen dry james lee georgia shaver and vincent vu ill em in for their generosity and patience in allowing themselves to be interviewed by phone and email for this article
warmest thanks and gratitude also to those who kindly gave additional insights and helpful suggestions for this piece especially laurie patters on mary ro we tom samantha levin ef in ley howard gad lin and the anonymous reviewers of the manuscript
introduction as organizational ombudsmen in the st century we stand on the shoulders of giants
the forerunners in our profession in many sectors have established significant and lasting foundations upon which organizational has not only evolved but flourished
although the implementation of organizational ombudsman offices in international agencies has for many been relatively recent there were some notable exceptions
in this article will review few international ombudsman offices through the words of those associated with their early and crucial development
in particular the ombudsmen interviewed here give their perspectives on similar questions asked commonly of each
the aim was to identify commonalities and divergences in the way offices have come into being and subsequently evolved
mindful of the increasing numbers of organizational ombudsmen offices in international agencies and of the consciously evolving nature of the series on pioneers of our profession opportunistically interviewed several of these pioneers
in some cases it possible to speak directly with the people concerned in these instances those approached kindly wrote answers to the set of standardised questions see table asked of each
david miller journal of the international ombudsman association david miller interviews for this article took place in early and followup discussions were undertaken thereafter
in the descriptions below answers given are weaved into broad narrative though specific answers are given where they provide insight into the or the thinking
ombudsman for the world bank james hen dry was the second ombudsman for the world bank wb serving in that role from
the first to hold that role was gene we bb who as lawyer had served as counsel for complainants involved in the world bank appeals process
jim takes up the was an economist by profession and worked in the world bank for years until compulsory retirement aged in
had been manager in the wb and therefore knew the culture had the respect of colleagues and managers
becoming ombudsman was terminal assignment of years
be fired had routine salary increases and guaranteed access to the president and vice presidents
had very little idea of what an ombudsman was
describing his induction and immersion into the ombudsman role jim stated that the culture of the world bank was significant support in getting established and in the wb was special kind of corporate organisation not for profit with prominent concern for staff morale and welfare
there was heavily european attitude to dispute resolution which was more positive than the norm in the us
the wb was looking for supplement to the formal appeals process
also thinking on the role was influenced by an article in harvard business review silver on the role of corporate ombudsmen may june
what as the impetus in developing the organizational ombudsman role in your organisation sector
what ere the significant early events andor developments that laid foundation for the evolution of your role
what ere the challenges you faced in implementing the role
who ere your key colleagues allies outside your organisation and how did they make difference to your ability to work
what did colleagues in the organisation assume your role to be
did that affect the way you worked
what in ds of cases did you see at first
how did these characteristics change over time
ere there significant legal issues impacting on how you worked
ho did the development of professional associations eg university and college om buds association the ombudsman association toa the international ombudsman association influence your work
what have been the major events issues that have impacted on your work and role in recent years
how do you see the future of the organizational ombudsman profession
standardised questions for pioneers of international agencies journal of the international ombudsman association david miller additionally having direct and practical support from colleagues in related administrative areas proved to be of considerable feel any part of the bank was against the ombudsman role
the president of the bank alden win ship claus en was very supportive and the main point of contact was the vice president for personnel
had access to anybody and had complete support from the top
had very good relationship with the social worker in the medical department
she was very easy to work with and helped some health overlays to visitor presentations
also the head of the personnel department and personnel officers were very
it seems that jim came into the role with his credibility clearly established through his considerable expertise and long service as wb staff member
indeed he described his main challenge at that time as simply that of learning how ombudsmen worked
in this regard he described being helped considerably by his effective collaborative relationship with the then ombudsman of the international finance corporation and the early development of the corporate om buds association the early an assortment of early oos mary ro we and ombudsmen from an he user bu sch southland corporation etc
found each other and became the
in we held our first conference in massachusetts around people attended
the became the toa which became
gaining visibility in the role was an essential early initiative and jim was interviewed early on for the wb in house magazine
additionally the president of the wb sent very supportive letter to all staff explaining the role and principles of the office
the other main instruction for staff on the role of the office came through word of mouth
from staff of jim would see plus visitors annually
casework during his tenure focussed on performance evaluations career development issues probation and the exercise of disciplinary measures
jim had two cases where management asked me to look into something and the president and vice presidents would also ask for inputs and advice from time to time
never saw case of sexual harassment but did see many cases arising from managers being cowards in performance management
although he did not see any sexual harassment cases jim was instrumental in the first major initiative of the world bank to prevent sexual harassment
jim also described one case in which there were angry and very diverse reactions of employees to the prospective readmission to the workplace of person accused of crime
jim was very supportive of the
the world bank made important financial contributions to the first research program of
engagement with the profession lasted long after he retired from the wb ombudsman role in
for the next several years he became the first professional executive officer for the
having been on the board of during his ombudsman tenure at the world bank jim described knowing well the administrative difficulties of having the association run piecemeal by handful of volunteers
jim arranged the conferences collected dues and notably wrote and edited the first professional handbook for ombudsmen which journal of the international ombudsman association david miller sold for each
in looking forward to the future of the profession in jim was clear that the organizational ombudsman profession remains good viable alternative to formal dispute resolution systems and should therefore be encouraged to grow
he saw an enduring challenge to the profession as being that of perceived neutrality
dr jim hen dry remained active engaged and of good humour to the end with his loss we as profession lost beloved visionary early practitioner role model as effective and supportive as he was modest
james lee ombudsman to the united nations programmes and agencies united nations development program un dp united nations population fund and united nations office for project services un ops dr james jim lee became the first ombudsperson in following career in which he taught english in france sweden and ethiopia where he became assistant dean of arts in ha ile se lassie university before attaining in medieval french from van der bi lt university
he is fluent in english french italian and spanish with working knowledge of amharic and russian
he joined the united nations development programme in and became chief editor in working primarily with the executive board
jim still has great pleasure in working for what is now the office of the ombudsman for united nations funds and programmes serving un dp the united nations fund unicef un ops and the united nations entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women un women
the impetus for developing the organizational ombudsmen role in un dp came in the when there was growing awareness in un dp and un ops that staff were not well served by the internal justice system
in management reviewed the team of three people talked to all stake holders and made recommendations
key recommendation was that professional ombudsman office should replace the ombudsman panel of volunteers in place at that time
jim was coordinator of the ombudsman panel followed by linda sch ie ber both were volunteers
jim noted how volunteer basis for the ombudsman role really work in hierarchical organization
as resources diminished over time volunteers on the panel became afraid to speak out
cases were discussed openly among panel members visitor confidentiality was minimal
accordingly among other steps jim stopped general discussion of ongoing cases with names attached
ultimately the administration created the office of the ombudsperson
jim was asked to be the first ombudsperson and was appointed by the three executive heads and the staff association
he believes he was chosen because he the trust of many could speak the truth and as editor of executive board reports knew how to give advice and empower people
also had years of dealing with conflict at the university level in several of the international ombudsman association david miller jim describes the functioning of the office in its early days as presenting significant challenges as well as opportunities
for example on the plus side the growing perception of the need for an ombudsman
plus the idea had the buy in of the major players the administrations of the three programmes and the staff association
there was an issue of the length of the term of office five year term was unprecedented in the funds and programmes the maximum length of contract was two years so was placed on rolling two year contracts
key early element was the quality of the relationship between the administration and the
on the other hand while the need for the office was fully appreciated and understood the work of the office was not
and there were widely differing expectations of the office eg most staff wanted classical ombudsman and expected that the ombudsman would have the power of determination of outcomes
did speak out on some issues but did not of course have the power of
key issue in the early days of the office was its relationship with human resources divisions and other were obstructive and want an ombudsman even some in senior management
my role was seen as interference and an indication of possible human resources failure
the weaker the human resources division the greater the importance of the role of the ombudsman
key colleagues included my colleagues on the ombudsman panel in administration and on the staff councils
made lot of friends in where learned all about the north american concept of an organizational ombudsman
the report of the redesign panel on the administration of justice in the united nations under the leadership of justice louise otis was very important in firmly establishing the role of the ombudsman in the informal resolution of place
as seen with other offices while having easy access to senior management was major plus in daily operations such proximity can lead to mis perceptions of dependence and partiality making it challenge to demonstrate independence and objectivity in the functioning of the office
in this regard colleagues readily attest to his principled willingness to speak up in the face of bad behaviour
as jim himself be neutral about something wrong
have the power of decisions about cases but do have the power of embarrassment
it was easier to function and to exert appropriate pressure because was wellknown
as with the other international agency pioneers discussed in this article caseload reflected increasing trust coming from senior management and the potential differences among the cases coming from headquarters and country cases were interpersonal and about entitle men ts
cases grew in complexity over the years
there were also increasing calls for help from senior management there was growing trust and recognition of the role
mediation mediated conversations was part of our work from the start very often in troubled country
journal of the international ombudsman association david miller it was clear from the outset that the office could not deal with cases of sexual harassment or other forms of gross misconduct which required formal investigation
nevertheless jim described major early achievement of his role in helping to implement the policy on sexual harassment adopted across the three agencies covered by his office
jim also described the added value of affiliation and training as the role of the organizational ombudsman became more firmly joined toa when took up office in
had known what an ombudsman was supposed to do
when was appointed toa and found the link also to patricia durr ant the first un ombudsman
the toa training courses were excellent particularly om buds they gave indications of best practices and brought together ombudsmen from widely differing practices
toa was also trying to attract international audiences and when was created it was very useful in helping me to understand the role of organizational ombudsmen
in the united nations we are something of hybrid because we have cases dealing with the misapplication of un staff regulations and rules which replace national legislation and by which we are all
as veteran in his field and in his sector jim has clear view of the challenges and future of the organizational ombudsman is moving in the right direction at least in the un
there is huge job potential for the further development of conflict resolution and prevention
it is encouraging that younger people are more and more aware of the possibilities of the profession
professional conflict resolution in schools and work places is response to violence and bullying
am also very happy about certification we need to make professional standards more rigorous
at the same time succession is big problem and we must all make special effort in the un to circulate vacancy announcements in timely fashion to avoid having to look around for people with the right profile to be an
finally jim had positive things to say about those with whom he had worked during his tenure and well into what he calls his office has expanded and all colleagues have brought their own strengths
veronica ma me diag ne and helm ut buss have all brought new perspectives and expertise to the role of the ombudsman in informal conflict resolution in the workplace
all the principles we established are in force today and have been enriched by each successive ombudsman
other key colleagues have included se lo me sheila smith linda sch ie ber ken taro es kand ar ra steg ar and jud it
must also mention the special role of nancy ross and sharon gordon smith
it is wonderful team composed of people from all over the world and continue to learn so much from each of its
journal of the international ombudsman association david miller georgia shaver ombudsman to the world food programme georgia shaver was the first ombudsman for the world food programme taking office in
she came to the role having previously served in the organization from primarily in field programme support and management positions including in mozambique and ethiopia
the notion of an ombudsman function for initially arose during change management programme embarked upon in and subsequently during global staff survey in the idea emerged again
the then executive director acted on that recommendation by internally advertising the ombudsman shortly thereafter
georgia noted that early support came from key colleagues in management and hr in the organization
that support attracted her to the the executive director chief of staff and the then hr director were keen to implement as many recommendations as possible from the global staff survey and were all familiar with the ombudsman function and were very supportive
the organisation was also able to add new position at senior
georgia takes up the from scratch was huge challenge
there were no other ombudsmen based in rome to contact but fortunately there was the ombudsman training combined with the un ombudsman meeting one month after started the job that helped with implementing the role
it was challenging finding the right assistant and that took lot of time so had to carefully find temporary person choosing retiree who was highly respected by the staff getting the right office quickly getting the promo material ready organising information meetings putting together the data base choosing the right information to collect etc
it got very tiring having to explain over and over the role of the ombudsman the requirements etc
guess the biggest challenge was doing it on my own having been used to managing large offices with lot of people to call upon to do the work
for the establishment of the office and the role came from variety of sources both internally and my first month met with all key colleagues hr chief of staff deputy executive director executive director head of legal inspector general etc
and asked them to explain to me what was the role and function of the ombudsman
having been trained these meetings and gathering their impression assumptions allowed me to clarify and inform
in addition had to write the terms of reference of the ombudsman and these same people were part of the working group and through this exercise we were able to be on the same page
though over the five years organizational allies shifted slightly with the introduction of the ethics office at the beginning they included the inspector general the hr director the chief of staff the head of legal and of course the executive director
again towards the end of the mandate journal of the international ombudsman association david miller and with change in the ed would say that at the beginning of her mandate she was an ally but became less so as she embarked on other interests
many managers became supportive of the function all of the deputy executive directors there are four and several of the investigators working on harassment issues few legal officers and the staff relations officer in hr
my key allies outside of were the ombudsman mediators in the united nations high commission for refugees un dp and the world health organization who
they made difference by being so generous with their knowledge experience sharing the sharing of job descriptions data bases filing systems intake reports job grading etc
they made the office structuring that much easier and their tips and experience sharing helped me to avoid the pitfalls and progress more rapidly with laying the
as often found when new ombudsman joins or new office is opened there are visits from staff experiencing chronic difficulties in search of resolution first in the headquarters office and then from further first cases were those long standing intractable problems that no one else could solve
it was case of try the new kid on the block and see if we can get
also many came to visit former colleagues with whom had worked at least those based in headquarters
after several months however the cases became more diversified not only by issue but geographically contractually and by
georgia considered that the training and affiliation with gave her significant definitely influenced my work through the ombudsman training that was fortunate to have received within one month of my having taken up my appointment
also being member of boosted my standing within my organisation as membership in associations is
nevertheless early gains in the evolution of the office and function faced significant challenges not least with the pressures of organizational transition and downsizing and those associated with new my first year we had downsizing that impacted on my work by increasing the number of cases and requiring me to be better informed on rules and regulations with respect to contract nonrenewal separation packages etc
change in leadership executive director was challenging given the less than enthusiastic behaviour shown
when the ed starts making it difficult to meet her it is almost impossible to break this impasse
her attitude to wards all officers dealing with conflict accountability transparency etc
the opening up with respect to collaboration by the hr director second during my term helped tremendously to resolve issues
confidence between me the ombudsman and other important functions was important to ensuring impact on my work and
georgia eventually retired from and her ombudsman role in and has since been designing and teaching courses on alternative dispute resolution at the american university of rome
she is also engaged in for and more recently with the african union commission
when asked about how she sees the future of the profession she replied journal of the international ombudsman association david the future is strong
mediation has been added that completed the conflict resolution options for the staff
it would be an important next step if more funding could be provided to the office as well as more staff so that all functions could be rolled out with the same energy ie training publicity activity report follow
ombudsman for cern the european organisation for nuclear research organisation pour la recherche known as cern is the multinational research facility based in geneva switzerland with responsibility for investigating the limits of achieve able knowledge in particle physics
it is an extraordinary undertaking involving more than staff with users engineers and its research constituency boosting numbers to coming from more than countries
in cern astonished the world with its definitive identification of the boson key element in the particle that enables the development of mass and form
for years since its inception cern had no code of conduct no harassment or diversity procedure and no ombudsman
the only option for resolving disputes was to invoke formal complaints in accordance with the staff rules and regulations
the impetus for development of the ombudsman role came from wish to achieve an integrated hr policy including enabling an open channel through which people could experience zero barrier office for informal confidential case resolution
establishing the office was also seen frankly as good image for the organisation and as practical opportunity for nonaligned explanation and exemplification of the new code of conduct
an integrated strategy including code of conduct an ombudsman office diversity program and competency model along with policy for formal and informal resolution of harassment became operational with strong support from the cern council president and the staff association
however vincent noted that establishing the office was not without its was challenge to find convenient office close to common areas but also bit remote so people could come incognito and to then make appropriate modifications to the premises
it is by far not easy at cern to grab an office as all of them belong to various departments
then getting the mandate correct it had to be written by hr and the central legal service accepted by the staff association and then various officials at cern
it actually took some time to get it finalized but the mandate is in line with the code of ethics and standards of practice
then after that doing everything at the same time web site posters flyer to be distributed to all personnel at cern and tour all management meetings of the cern departments
so dedicated lot of time in the first few months to raising awareness about the om buds as was the first om buds at cern ever
raising awareness was most important as in scientific laboratory there was little culture towards the new cern code of conduct and om buds work
attracting attention and helping people understand the advantages of coming early in the problem required lot of information
so started to write articles for the cern bulletin
journal of the international ombudsman association david miller taking useful courses as soon as possible from and in mediation was very important
that was really total change for me coming from the managerial side
that was big challenge to change my mind from the managerial mind to mediator one neutral and impartial
was used to deciding and now should not interact so much but favour the decisions taken by the people themselves
my managerial tendency lead me in the beginning to interact and mix myself too much with the process of listening understanding coaching and trying to extract what the people wanted and what could be their
in common with other technological and normative agencies the supposed technical skills versus people management skills of managers have been focus for some negative perceptions at cern
vincent noted how many feel that people management was seen as weakness in management generally
he also noted how of the code of conduct was by no mean sufficient to guarantee its application
lot of information awareness raising and education still had to be provided would say especially in an institution where the scientific culture
vincent noted how important his fellow ombudsmen were for developing his confidence as an ombudsman geneva have profited from regular contacts with om buds of the international organ is at ions here
their advice is always plus in reflecting on difficult cases
felt less alone with such regular contacts which very often gave me the courage to continue and the feeling also that was on the right track on my action
moral support and feedback from them was most appreciated given the fact that did not receive much feedback from inside the house
also my overall connection with the and the united nations and related international organizations una rio ombudsman network supported me lot as felt part of an overall community of
main organizational allies within cern included the head of the hr department and hr advisers
additionally vincent said he found real benefit in some urgent cases from collaboration with the cern medical service
yet it appeared at the time of interview that supposed concerns for ensuring the absolute independence of the office may have contributed to an apparent lack of feedback from senior management although vincent was convinced that the director general and his team were positive supporters of his role
the case mix has been evolving since the office started with more than percent of cases seen by vincent being related to the broad category
he also noted how growing confidence in the ombudsman was reflected with the high initial numbers of visitors on limited contracts slowly giving way to more visitors on indefinite contracts
two features have stood out for him however relating to gender and to the issue of have seen proportionally to their populations greater percentage of women than men
looking at reports from other international organ is at ions it appears that this phenomenon is related to the percentage of women in the organisation
if there is an equal number of men and women in them then the percentages of conflicts is the same men and women
if the number of women is less then the percentage of conflicts involving women is higher generally double that involving men
journal of the international ombudsman association david milleri also handled very small number of mediations although the trend was increasing
contrary to the general feeling that mediation is widely used process must say that for me as an institutional om buds did actually very few of them
should probably have more widely explained what the process is
actually called them even if used the same process along with the same rules
the reason is that as soon as people hear that mediation takes place they expect result in terms of success or failure
wanted to avoid the bad feelings resulting from failure of mediation
does not generate perception of such defined
in common with others approached for this article vincent felt that and una rio membership conferred tangible umbrella of the and of the una rio as well allowed me to have an international and respected framework for my mandate and my ethics
so rules and the mandate associated with the cern om buds did not appear as homemade but well established internationally
it was and still is an important certification of my actions
cern also appreciated that another channel towards international contacts was
since retiring in late vincent has been enjoying retirement studying lot of zen writing on the chan masters and also at time of writing along the in china
vincent noted find myself with no spleen from cern and like peaceful zen
finally from his pioneering perspective of practitioner based in temple of science vincent makes some clear suggestions on future developments for the believe that the mandates of organisational ombudsmen are very restrictive and could be improved by allowing more proactive actions from the om buds
sometimes was at the limit of my mandate in order to effectively resolve cases
also the notion of should be favoured and not only the possibility of forwarding systemic recommendations
regular meetings with the management would be an asset and could be fostered by standards of practice
that would help om buds to participate in any culture change if needed
managers are sometimes the pure product of the culture of the institution
in order to change the way some managers act one would have to promote culture more directed towards respectful human relations
this is much more difficult to realise and there the participation of the om buds in such strategic plans would be most interesting
the om buds could then have standing invitations to strategic meetings concerning human resources for example either as observer or as an active member
in summary the om buds work should not be considered by the institutions as single conflict resolution tool but also as an active participant in policy for respectful workplace environment
would think that incentives in that direction by the and una rio would
journal of the international ombudsman association david miller concluding comments our pioneers have revealed that aside from establishing benchmarks for ombudsman office development in their own organizations they have also been pioneers in addressing many developments within our profession
some of the issues raised in their responses to similar questions seem timeless including concerns about managers and performance management the roles and impact of human resources departments and the necessity of facilitative structures in which ombudsman offices are contextual ised particularly the importance of good relationships with and support from senior leadership
additionally it has been revealing and reassuring to see the added value associated by ombudsmen and their organ is at ions with adhering to standards and principles and with the training and regular collegiality that provides
the pioneers interviewed also indirectly indicate how the standards of practice are most usefully seen as work in progress
the evolutionary stance of our pioneers in some areas of the standards eg independence informality and neutrality and our working boundaries as organisational rather than classical ombudsmen may challenge our contemporary views of these concepts
nevertheless we have all moved forward in our thinking and practice as result of their experience
it may be surprise that there are so many commonalities in the challenges and opportunities they have described it seems the needs behind the establishment of these offices remain as strong and as ubiquitous as ever

although an om buds office may not solve problems its worth can arise from lessening the likelihood of litigation separation and other unnecessary performance distractions for community members
perhaps the theme of successful om buds might be adapted from the popular book that without an om buds it could have been worse by ah benjamin
journal of the international ombudsman association bob mission and the value of an om buds office every activity that falls under the auspices of an organization should have realistic connection to the mission of the organization
activities eg tasks offices policies procedures should all flow from and support the mission that authenticates them
but if the concern with tasks eclipses the dignity of and respect for its workers one is reminded of the infamous quote from vietnam became necessary to destroy the village the worker in order to save accomplish it the
the mission of an om buds office revolves precisely around respecting and guarding the dignity of those who work at the tasks within the organization while simultaneously caring for the good of the organization
naturally the focus on individual empowerment should not contravene the mission and just as importantly whatever the om buds does should always be based upon its perceived value to the organization and consonant with its mission
om buds offices create value in variety of ways
they may help to an extant problem prevent significant problem or improve situation that had been invisible in the organization but that was nevertheless problematic
additionally they may offer cost effective services eg training mediation that improve the overall wellbeing
om buds offices show value similarly in variety of ways
they leadership about and thereby gain support for the mission of the om buds office
they publicize activities conclusions and results aggregated to avoid breaching confidentiality
an om buds can spot trends of significance that others may not see or may not see until much later
please remember that these reflections are aimed at observations that om buds might share with decision makers
do not mean to suggest that the examples offered would appear to be new to the om buds community itself
the role of an om buds office is directly concerned with the foundational values of an organization and whether organizational behavior aligns with those values
it becomes important at times therefore to revisit these foundational values
let me offer an analogy as to why we should do so
at playoff time coaches can be heard screaming the same admonitions at players in the that the players have heard from the seventh grade with your feet quit reaching
have deleted the expletives that frequently accompany these admonitions
apparently top level coaches believe that reminding even their star players of such truisms is critical to their success
if it is important to revisit fundamental principles at significant moments ie when much money is at stake it probably holds true for organizations where even more money and the welfare of many more people are at stake
as players can fail to observe game fundamentals organizations too can lapse in the observance of sound organizational principles about how best to deal with people
hence it is useful to examine some of these principles as they are popularly understood
journal of the international ombudsman association bob and communities om buds environs given that fundamentals are emphasized when considerable amounts of money and pressure are at stake it may be appropriate to review some fundamentals salient to the om buds showing worth to leadership when the stakes may be similarly high
organizations are formed to facilitate tasks that individuals could not accomplish as well
the tasks are deemed by someone or some group to be important enough to create the organization
communities however are the resultant togetherness of similarly task driven individuals
it is useful to distinguish between them if not philosophically at least as they are regularly understood by the popular mind
popularly understood then one would work for an organization while one would work with community
without more than passing implication it might be remembered that slaves worked for the masters who owned them while working with the other slaves who shared their plight
given the nature of the organization it should be understandable that bureaucracy is most appropriate form of management because of characteristics ie hierarchical authoritative rational specialized and accountable
one could easily compile list of efficiency compartmentalization predictability credential ing quantification and secrecy
clearly the characteristics and of the organization do not comport well with those of communities
rather the desirable characteristics of communities personal collaborative empowered intense and fluid oppose those of organizations
one imagines the embodiment of bureaucracy in general motors the veterans administration and government
conversely enthusiasm team work and other terms that typically represent communities might include teams study groups task force of strong functional families
although such communities may experience they frequently can solve them internally based upon their strong personal bonds and successful communication patterns
william theory management arose out of the challenges posed by the tensions inherent in linking effectively bureaucracy with community
bureaucracy fits organizations aiming to improve efficiency while communities tend to value efficiency less than the togetherness of mission driven groups
communities often arise within organizations and can be seen as oppositional players versus referees with inherently different
although they have differing dynamics community remains part of the larger organization communities contribute to organizations and organizations contribute to communities
the om buds office lives within both worlds
many of the problems that confound visitors seem to occur in the intersection between the community and the organization
although organizationally task driven the om buds is specifically charged with safeguarding fairness in the treatment of all and thus focused upon the person as person not just as task doer
an example of the competing interests of organization and community might be the effort by various authors to identify organizations
independent of subsequent criticisms of in search of excellence themes seem to devalue the bureaucratic and encourage journal of the international ombudsman association bob community minded ones
the popular conclusion was that the less bureaucratic an company was the more personal and community supportive it became
further it appeared to be causal connection ie the less bureaucratic the more communitarian the more
again this was popular not scientifically validated conclusion
the implication was that the best organizations aimed toward being the least bureaucratic were most likely to value their contributions and that led to business success
this appeared to be counterintuitive to many
an organization that creates and supports an om buds office makes formal statement that its members are important as people not simply task doers
therefore the enterprises involving humans must attend to the differences that human involvement creates in the accomplishment of task
if the specifically human dimension remains unattended negative outcomes are inevitable
the organizational between absent weak or inaccurate communication patterns or behavior that jeopardizes respect for others and damage to the organization is reminiscent of rachel silent spring which ignited the ecology movement
her observation about the ecological between cause and effect was enlightening to most
her insights revealed that events that appeared to be unrelated were in fact causally connected
humans doing work are more than machines ie that may do the same work and often better faster and more uniformly
but workers remain human not simply task doers with ws
they bring to those tasks all their humanness which includes strengths and weaknesses
when the human gifts such as creativity spontaneity and dedication abound they enrich the lives of coworkers and the workplace where so many spend so much time
when these gifts are stifled organizational impoverishment results
the importance of communication it is self evident that communication could be considered like connective tissue for healthy communities
though we have the capacity for endless worldwide instant communication we seem not to be able to improve relationships often the very stuff of om buds activity
necessary to the successful community is clear accurate consistent and frequent communication formal and informal
but it is evident that not all people are skilled at communication and their numbers are increasing and their skills decreasing
it is also clear that with the disintegration of societal communication skills people are entering the workforce with less experience in successfully resolving conflict eg kids playing by themselves can learn conflict resolution more quickly than if they have to have adult supervision while playing
one cannot fail to note the clear decline of social and conversational skills throughout society hence among employees and students
this is most ironic given the virtual permeation of contemporary life through electronic connectedness
intellectually principles of good communication are not hard to understand
people often understand how to communicate eg be attentive clarify definitions but act as though they knew nothing about such principles
relationship breakups frequently reveal poor performance independent of cognitive understanding
such behavior characterizes many in the workplace and can create the environment that might explain when and why organizations would benefit from an om buds office
in work places where poor communication patterns can become the norm the opportunities for om buds activity are almost endless
one can almost imagine anne sull ivan indispensable teacher and companion as having performed role similar to that of an om buds
journal of the international ombudsman association bob even in well run organizations whenever communication weaknesses overshadow strengths even if temporarily there is an opportunity for om buds activity
should policies procedures or programs either treat classes of people in way that diminishes human dignity or unfairly affects individuals opportunities arise for om buds activity
similar opportunities arise if individuals or groups treat others unfairly within or around the workplace
one needs only to recall the increased number of instances of workplace or schoolhouse bullying to recognize the suffering realize the costs and see the benefits of addressing the issues pro actively
whenever the tasks overshadow the dignity value or importance of the human task doers the community suffers
how can an om buds help the organization
an om buds can assist individuals as well as organizations
an om buds can help individuals by offering safe place showing the concern for the by supplementing not replacing any existing office or function by encouraging facilitating communication or offering referrals especially when communication has become difficult whatever the reason
assistance can include shuttle diplomacy or mediation
the om buds can empower the visitor by helping to provide clarity where there has been confusion and options where people might have come in not knowing what to do enhancing the self image where vulnerability had reigned
although not personal advocate for the visitor the om buds remains always concerned about the fairness of processes and procedures respecting the individual as well as the good of the organization
because om buds offices are not yet well or widely understood om buds need to offer pro actively clear and accurate orientation especially for leaders and then enlisting their aid for rank and file
when leaders understand the value of the office they are more inclined to encourage workers to avail themselves of it
enlightened leaders recognize that the om buds office provides safe place confidential independent impartial and informal the principles of the profession
safe haven encourages workers to discern calmly before acting rashly
it is good bet that all are better served when people do not act rashly
since visits are optional and unofficial the om buds office offers an informal alternative to creating record in human resources which often complicates and memorializes the issue
since visitor started anything nothing to lose by airing out the issue with the om buds
an invisible visit can often reduce the anxiety of visitors even if their issue is not solved
additionally because of their unique data availability om buds can spot trends earlier than might otherwise be the case
leaders can be shown the value by becoming aware of his her effects
if the work of an om buds office reduces turnover in employees attrition in students or elevates morale and bad morale often goes unnoticed by supervisors or lessens the likelihood of litigation or improves productivity and job satisfaction or increases skills or empowers members strengthening the community that office offers value to the organization
journal of the international ombudsman association bob following five examples of real life om buds situations and outcomes may surprise leadership but would be recognized in the om buds community as commonplace
visitor is frustrated and ready to leave employment but sees way beyond the immediate problem and decides to stay and try options he seen before everyone wins
through series of apparently disconnected issues the om buds detects what seems like trend giving leadership an opportunity to address it earlier will most likely reduce the harm it can create if left unmanaged
student has an issue that seems insurmountable and yet after successful visit returns to the classroom or dorm with better outlook on the problem that results in real revenue neither lost if the student were to withdraw nor wasted if she were to stay but with little hope of success because of the unresolved issue
number of employees make similar but unconnected complaints about the same supervisor an opportunity might arise whereby the supervisor could receive timely and useful formative feedback and become better supervisor instead of just chastened one everyone wins
an employee is terminated and is concerned that there were to the event visit to the om buds might help clarify and sort impressions
perhaps the process was unnecessarily abrupt if not unfair
visit to the om buds might initiate an improvement in termination styles that clarify reasons for the termination and offer options to the employee creating less confrontational separation
if the termination were justified better that the employee leave on good terms than on hostile hurt ones
if unjustified better the process be corrected than remain flawed
in any event less hostile ex employee is win
if the value is absent or invisible in the mind of leadership organizations large and small that start om buds programs might more easily opt out of them as an unnecessary if modest cost or as source of unnecessary discomfort
that seems to guarantee more tenuous om buds office existence than necessary
it is incumbent on the om buds office itself therefore to convince leadership about the value of the office
the effectiveness of om buds activity is neither magical nor mysterious
two characteristics seem to be essential to successful the safe haven that the om buds office provides and the support of leadership
he om buds office provides safe haven for supervisor and supervisee alike
the haven is op ti on al confidential independent impartial and informal the necessary principles from which an om buds operates
supp or at the leadership level is also critical to om buds success
such support is manifested by leaders who offer knowledge about and support for all to consider the availability of the office
and given the need for belief in the value of the efficacy it becomes critical for the om buds office to be persuasive about showing its value
journal of the international ombudsman association bob through various metaphors since om buds functions are neither widely known nor well understood perhaps cross disciplinary analogies can offer knowledge that allows leadership an easier entrance into the discussion of the value of an om buds office
therefore like to offer view of through set of metaphors whose intent is to provoke thought beyond om buds frameworks rather than create ironclad comparisons
again although this approach may not shed light to ombudsmen it is intended to offer some new approaches for om buds offices as they attempt to persuade leadership about the worth of the om buds office
he om buds and the family practice doctor
he om buds as communications analyst
he om buds as mission monitor
he analogy between the om buds and the doctor may be helpful since most people have extensive experience with medical doctors but so little with an om buds
the om buds doctor analogy can lean on the quality of the medical encounter either in its presence with excellent doctors or its absence with poor ones
in good doc tor patient om buds visitor encounters doctors and om buds exhibit excellent listening skills and manifest the ability to separate chaff from the in the story
furthermore they are bound by requirements to safeguard confidentiality
both doc tors and ombudsmen understand the optional nature of visit cherish professional independence but are secure enough to consult when necessary
and they understand that it remains the decision about what to do with options presented
since earlier detection is likely to achieve healthier outcomes they steadfastly encourage healthier processes lifestyle choices that foster prevention of undesirable outcomes and maintain concern for the whole patient not just the sum of the parts
both advocate for noninvasive options eg physical therapy healthy diets stress reducing techniques and reframing arguments that can achieve results that might be safer less invasive less expensive and better overall than more dramatic surgical quitting techniques
and both that although sometimes surgery separation from employment may be clearly indicated observing wise counsel is almost certain to better prepare the patient for the surgery or the employee for separation even if surgery separation is indicated
he most farseeing family practitioners are moving their practices rapidly toward model that emphasizes prevention
one example of the sea change encouraging prevention is reflected in the guide to community preventive services
if so much effort money talent and time by so many is directed at prevention professionals must think that it is efficacious and cost effective
surely wisdom lies in the adage about the ounce of prevention
journal of the international ombudsman association bob revent ion as viable approach to improvement is common sense
data indicate that we are living longer and generally healthier lives
we can learn much from the movement towards heart health via exercise cholesterol lowering diets and medicinal supplements like niacin stat ins omega fish oil that are all used to reduce cardiac incidents
lifestyle changes seem to work eg increase the quality of life decrease the incidence of disease etc
although pr event ion and the om buds would seem to have natural linkage prevention is sometimes hard case to justify to the accounting department
perhaps viable way of manifesting the value of prevention is for the om buds office to estimate the salary values of those whom the office has helped stay when without the intervention those employees would have left employment
detailing even through estimation the costs that would have been incurred by those separations eg downtime costs lowered productivity costs increased search costs
such an exercise soon yields significant dollar amount that the om buds office saved
the most inflexible accountants might be persuaded by such numbers
er haps an increased emphasis on preventive energy designed to reduce employee stress lowered productivity workplace hostility and ultimately unnecessary turnover enhances the om buds worth
office observations of on boarding goals and techniques might identify their possible relationship to early turnover
observing the difficulty of new hires might reveal hiring process flaws unclear expectations supervisor proficiency
again these preventive activities can enhance the worth of an om buds office
om buds ac might be viewed metaphorically as pro biotic for the health
since bacteria those that fight disease and promote health can be lost during antibiotic regimens and can affect deleteriously the health of the gut adding bacteria lactobacillus bifid oba teri um genera which are believed to promote gut health to the diet makes sense
although some might resist the notion of intentionally ingesting bacteria the popularity of yogurt testifies that many believe it to be tasty as well as good for them
bacteria can weaken or strengthen an organism so too poor communication can weaken or destroy community
and good communication like good bacteria can promote it
for instance random acts of kindness or habit of friendliness tend to affect community positively as pro biotic does to the digestive tract
conversely weak inconsistent or absent communication can weaken or destroy community as can an infection healthy organism
and like bacteria plural that are comprised of many units communication is comprised of many individual units acts of communication or the absence thereof
over time these acts good or defective create patterns that can be clear poor vague misleading etc
good relationships can be severed by serious act of bad communication after which forgiveness may be exceptionally difficult
often weak communication is not the result of single isolated communication action like bacterium but rather of multiple acts bacteria causing an infection which have multiplier effect on the communicative environment
taken to its worst case an infection can cause serious harm even death
similarly community can be destroyed by rampant bad communication patterns
unquestionably problems are easier to manage the less entrenched they are
pro biotics help the body heal itself through prevention or empowerment of useful bacteria to overcome harmful bacteria
similarly critical mass of good communication patterns selfless behavior journal of the international ombudsman association bob directions and expectations can overcome behavior less supportive of community life
but it seems to take many good bacteria to overcome few bad whereas few bad can overcome many good
we know the adage bad apple can spoil the
unfortunately it seem to be reversible so that good apple can redeem
this would appear to be something like social entropy how rapidly community is disintegrating
it takes less energy talent skill and time to destroy community than to build one ie it is easier to corrupt than to create
an om buds can often help parties to repair deeply wounded relationship but like most repairs the process can take time willingness and effort
he very existence of an om buds office shows that the organization is concerned about the health of the community and would prefer to expend resources more in prevention and maintenance than in the more expensive less efficient repair mode
he om buds can be likened also to communications analyst who discerns patterns in what appear to be somewhat chaotic stories
the om buds is trained to know that the of visitor is probably not revealed in the first telling and may become evident only after more extended conversation
stories may reveal or conceal pattern and story may be best understood as snapshot or it may be movie ie the story may reveal genuine characteristic or may simply be an anomalous experience
the om buds is uniquely qualified to probe because the job allows for time to explore the communication depths rather than stay with the superficial
unlike other task doers in the organization the time is dedicated to the human condition of the visiting task doers rather than simply their task doing
all others in the or ga ni zati on are focused on the tasks themselves
only after getting closer to the deeper story might the real interest of the visitor become manifest
when the real interests become clear so often does the problem and hence clearer set of options
although behavior patterns can improve or worsen people are not static improvement is probably easier with assistance
he om buds can be likened to mission monitor in that he she can help monitor social
this is less because the om buds is prophet foretelling the future than that his her task is focused on attention to the status of the community as community reading more carefully the reality of the present
if community were to be compared to building one would clearly want advance notice before the building community collapsed
when the om buds does his her job well everyone wins
primar task of an om buds is to observe the sync between mission and behavior on both micro individual issues and macro trends potting level
on the micro level the om buds might receive information that an individual is behaving contrary to the mission and is concerned only with just getting the task done
or an individual is demeaning another and no one knows
on the macro level the om buds may discern behavior patterns eg regarding diversity favoritism that contravene the mission even though the tasks get done
no other office is so tasked to observe or equipped to assist in identifying the status of the sync as is the om buds
the success of the om buds office should facilitate the living up to its mission statement
and the integrity of an organization is derived from coherence between action and mission
journal of the international ombudsman association bob sync problem and solution lesson from voltaire and bern stein the importance of the to visitor cannot be overstated
the om buds frames or reframes the expectation of the visitor and when the visitor and the om buds share realistic expectation the likelihood of successful outcome escalates
when their expectations are not in sync successful outcomes become anomalous rather than predictable
less than optimal om buds activity often results from expectations being unrealistically optimistic
successful om buds activity on the other hand builds upon realistic expectations and hard work over time
perhaps the following selections from famous american musical illustrate well both the problem and the solution
in leonard candide opened on broadway to critical acclaim for its perceptive lyrics and sophisticated musical qualities
the libretto was based upon novella candide published in in which voltaire satirizes religion traditional values and the optimistic philosophy of gottfried
had argued that to be successful in the world one should accept that we are living in the of all possible and therefore should accept our status without working hard to improve it
the two songs that serve my purpose are happy we
candide wellborn and disciple of the panned dr pangloss in greek and the beautiful but also cun eg on de steal an innocent kiss

candide and cun eg on de parrot the philosophy of optimism as they anticipate their happy marriage
imagine cun eg on de as the visitor and candide as the om buds
have included both the lyrics and the from you tube and encourage listening to the music as well as following the lyrics
the expectations of marriage om buds visit are clearly not in sync
probably all om buds have had visits where the expectation sync simply was not present
when expectations are not in sync the likelihood of success understandably is abysmally low
and as word of unsuccessful om buds experiences spreads throughout an organization leadership confidence wanes understandably and much good can be undone unnecessarily
the most famous song that closes candide can illustrate the matured expectations of both the visitor and the om buds
after surviving all the tragedies they have come to reject unrealistic optimism as the prescription for success in the real world
they understand how marriage functions as only the unmarried can
they have come to realize that success is not magic but the result of hard work and is not instantaneous but measured
hence rash judgments and blind optimism are imprudent and futile
knowing their expectations have been unreal they are now ready to get on with the authentic task at hand
our garden the journal of the international ombudsman association bob tour de force from candide captures their newly acquired wisdom
and for more enjoyable and richer experience encourage listening to the song as well as following the argument
remember cun eg on de is the visitor and candide the om buds
much of the work of making garden grow takes place in the dark
depleted soil has been enriched impacted soil has been loosened and aerated
this work is unnoticed and most often not measured easily perhaps not until the plants emerge from the ground
only upon emergence and then much later as the health of the plants becomes clear does the effect of the work prior to emergence also become clear
similarly as with pro biotic the work is virtually invisible unnoticed
over time however the effect becomes clear not so much from dramatic cure as from what has improved gradually
sometimes the improvement experientially connected with the pro biotic remember when started taking it but noticed that no longer have the
likewise is the work of the om buds unnoticed somewhat subterranean with minimal records or publicity
often the beneficial effects noticed only later may not be associated with the work that took place much earlier under the guidance of skilled om buds
conclusion one might expect the om buds to be sensitive to analogies like the ones presented
but he she cannot expect leaders to be equally attuned to such analogies although once presented to them they may accept their worth
the om buds cannot expect leadership simply to trust that the position provides value for cost
the case for value has to be stronger than my word for
the reasons for the case are simple
well run organizations lapse in proper behavior and can benefit so no organizational shame in having an om buds office

the content of reviewed manuscripts and of reviews should not be shared with anyone other than the editor of the
journal of the international ombudsman association it is important for reviews to have forward looking beneficial intent this is an opportunity to give feedback that will help nurture guide and develop authorship
it is not an exercise in showing you know more are wiser or more clever and literate in the subject matter
authors should learn from reviews and take away from the review sense of future direction and beneficial development for their paper
the aim of the review is to strengthen contributions to the and thereby strengthen the ombudsman profession
in this sense review is as much critique of the reviewer as of the manuscript
accordingly it is requirement that all reviews offer information that can help guide the author
although reviews are confidential ie the manuscript author does not know who the reviewers are they are best written as though the author is in the room
accordingly useful test of the assertions is the test if they were standing in the dock at the old bailey would they be able to justify their assertions to the author
are they making statements that are justifiable verifiable and credible or just say so
does the tone of their review convey the standards of practice in practice
reviewers are asked to look out for issues of comprehension in manuscripts ake strong recommendations where appropriate for authors to break up long void and where possible eliminate jargon maintain only one idea per sentence
each of these issues comprises an element of the fog index the estimation of the comp reh sion afforded by manuscript
where the fog index is high comprehension is low and vice versa
the aims for the lowest possible fog indexes for manuscripts
where criticism is appropriate it should ideally be constructive and be contextual ised within set of options given by the reviewer for modification of the text
where there are clear mistakes inaccuracies or errors these should be indicated and corrections or options for alternative expression suggested
personal criticism whether of content ideology style or tone is unacceptable
please note suggestions for modification should be item ised and returned to the editor using the to the section of the referee review form which is sent to reviewers together with the manuscript to be reviewed
suggestions for modification should not be returned to the editor in the form of in the original manuscript
this would identify the reviewer to the author and even if this does not concern the reviewer it might concern or prejudice the author in their consideration of the comments
reviewing is form of power relationship
that is why anonymity is required on both sides

ombudsman history dispute resolution governance measures of success public policy membership program evaluation charles howard observations of an on the future and challenges facing and the organizational ombudsman profession
introduct ioni have been described as an and believe that is good description
am not an ombudsman but have represented om buds and om buds offices for twenty five years and have been intimately involved in many of the legal issues relating to the role
have enormous respect for what ombudsmen do and believe it is an increasingly necessary function in organizations
despite my support for the rather because of want to raise various issues in an effort to help promote the profession
will offer some unvarnished observations of the international ombudsman association from my perspective as an
in this sense my goal is to speak truth to power in the best traditions of om buds practice
will also offer recommendations on how better to proceed
having identified its mission of having an organizational om buds in every organization the present challenge for the and om buds is to identify how they can help the profession move from where it is now to where they want it to be
journal of the international ombudsman association charles howard historical context to fully understand this potential for major organizations one must understand the historical context in which the om buds profession has developed
by historical context am not referring just to the evolution of the om buds role from its roots in scandinavia
that history is familiar to almost all om buds howard
rather want to focus on the om buds role in organizations and on my understanding of how society has changed and the pressures that have been placed on organizations
begin hundred years ago during the progressive era in the united states and consider what theodore roosevelt and the progressives had to deal with political corruption brought about by the influence of big money abusive business practices toward workers and labor and the extraordinary concentration of business power and monopolistic practices
there is an analogy today in each of these areas
some of the reforms that came out of the progressive era in response to these concerns were the direct election of us senators federal income tax progressive labor reform and new antitrust laws
in addition it was during that era that unions began to grow significantly and to serve as counterbalance to the power of industrial organizations
but the high point of union membership in the united states was in union membership has been declining ever since
currently union membership in the private sector is only about percent of the workforce
in fact more than percent of all workers are no longer fulltime employees they are part time contingent or contract workers howard
this decline in union membership and increase in the percentage of workers who are not employees has created an unbalanced relationship between organizations and workers
it is unlikely that unions in the united states will reemerge as counterbalancing force against business or government or large organizations in the immediate future
in addition to the decline of unions we are now experiencing an unprecedented role for multinational corporations
based on data that is now slightly more than ten years old approximately percent of the industrial output is produced by the largest corporations in the world howard
similarly of the one hundred largest economies in the world surveyed in fifty three were indication of significant concentration of business power howard
this concentration of economic power would surely be even greater today
in addition most of these large corporations are also not only multinational but also multicultural organizations
there are similar trends in academic institutions
in the university context significant number of universities have populations of more than students and american colleges have an unprecedented global focus and numbers of international students howard
these changes present large organizations with challenges that are exacerbated by the increasing use of technology
there also are other demographic changes including more gender diversity in the workforce and in organizational leadership howard
when we look at how our society has responded to these challenges it has often been through law and regulation
for example consider the dodd frank legislation title vii and the sar banes ox ley act of but think in many ways law is clumsy tool to deal with these issues because it does not operate on the front line
journal of the international ombudsman association charles howard first in order to protect people from retaliation the law has tended to create cause of action for retaliation
unfortunately the law cannot really protect people from retaliation
it only gives person cause of action to bring retaliation claim
if person has been retaliated against he or she has the right to bring lawsuit to claim that they suffered retaliation because for example that person was whistle blower
but at this point that person has already lost because in our system of law he or she has become the adversary and the whole force of the organization is pitted against him or her
second there are many whistle blower laws in the united states offering bounties to whistle blower who prevails on his or her claim but these laws are not responsive to the dilemma faced by real people when they are considering whether to become whistle blowers
person has to decide that he or she is going be whistle blower without clear assurance that the claim will succeed or that the government will make recovery on which bounty will be paid
even if the government ultimately determines that the whistle blower is entitled to bounty the whistle blower receive that bounty until several years down the road howard et al
and what happens to these people in the meantime
it is often very difficult time for professionally and most will never receive bounty howard
third although there is plethora of governmental legislation and regulation in an attempt to protect whistle blowers from retaliation so much of what whistle blowers what organizational om buds must deal with in the workplace or other areas where they what would call interactions that can be retaliatory but are the
it is in this space that laws and regulations are particularly ineffective and it is this space where we most need solution to help people and organizations
there is limit to how effective laws and regulation can be in addressing the retaliation which can be quite chilling to experience
so who is going be on the front line to deal with these issues
who is going to deliver value to large organizations and the people in them to provide assistance in the face of how the organizations have evolved globally the economic pressure on them and the limitations of laws and regulations
it does not suffice to say this is role that unions previously role that has expanded with the growth and complexity of unions cannot fill the role today
believe organizational ombudsmen are ideally suited to fill that role
in contemplating the function that can be served by filling this role my goal is to challenge readers to think in larger terms
in particular urge readers to consider two other points that think should be the essential characteristics of whatever mechanism is designed to fit in that space
the first is the concept of checks and balances which was one of the most fundamental principles in the design of the us government
in our private entities businesses foundations universities or any other type of organization that has linear top down decision making model however similar concept of checks and balances is rare
these organizations operate based on pyramidal structure with management decisions made at the top
yet when an organization has or or plus employees and workers inevitably there will be organizational blockages conflict and misconduct
journal of the international ombudsman association charles howard there is no question of whether an systems will fail on occasion it is only question of when and where
and the key systems design question is how does one surface issues that are blocked
how do we remove those blockages
that is where think om buds come in
we have dual drivers of the enterprise but we can have an information flow to the top outside of the standard mechanism to help an organization know where blockages are and how to deal with issues that have gotten stuck thereby preventing them from surfacing
my second observation is that there are many formal reporting structures as result of pressures from the law as well as legislative and regulatory requirements
indeed think there are so many laws and regulations from so many levels of government and other sources that the average person including reasonably experienced lawyer like me often does not know where to go to raise an issue or how to address concern
in multicultural multinational world we should be asking ourselves what the sources of organizational information how someone accesses information without triggering all of the investigational machinery that might then be used against him or her
confidential source of information is therefore crucial
in trying to answer these questions my analysis suggests that modern large organizations need mechanism that can help to provide checks and balances by serving as an informal and confidential source of information and advice on options for surfacing issues and concerns
in my opinion that is where the organizational ombudsman comes in
believe this is an important role and that as result every major organization should have an organizational om buds
although this will be challenging undertaking to make reality believe that seeing the development of the role for om buds in this historical context should inspire us all
my first observation is that is too small
the organization has grown gradually and now has almost members
the puts on great conference but if the goal is om buds ubiquity this pace and approach will not get the profession where it wants to be quickly enough
in survey of fortune companies following up on survey only percent of those companies had om buds stipa no wich and lam are
that percent included anything that called itself an om buds program whether or not it operated in accordance with the standards of practice
that number also represents percent increase in the utilization of om buds programs over when the corresponding number was percent stipa no wich and lam are
nevertheless even percent penetration level is not enough to serve as launching point for where the profession wants to go
although there is more widespread acceptance of the om buds concept today in colleges and universities the role is far from universal even in that setting
the small size of means the organization does not have the money to accomplish its goals
for this reason would challenge to think big have vision of where it can be and belief that it can do something even though the way is unclear
if really does believe that an om buds program is function that should be in every major organization will need to become much bigger than it is today
believe that is too dependent on its members for volunteer help in almost every aspect of what it does
one could not find more dedicated and capable group of people
for example those who journal of the international ombudsman association charles howard have served as president of have done so on essentially fulltime basis despite the fact that each one also had very demanding day job
however have observed burnout in these leaders after year or two in this dual role
believe this burnout is unnecessary because there should be way to enable volunteers to serve as leaders without having it take all of their time
to do that however requires both staff and volunteers to assist with follow through on policy decisions as well as retaining people with specialized knowledge or skills such as lawyers or management consultants so that not everything has to be accomplished solely through the use of volunteers
to move to the next level where can achieve its mission will require staff and specialized assistance from outside its member base
applaud current efforts to move in this direction but this takes money which reinforces my first point needs to have larger footprint and thus bigger revenue base to accomplish its mission
related concern is turnover on the board of directors
this suggests that there is not enough continuity for long term policy decisions
is experiencing generational transition and that is good
but it takes more than year or two of board service to understand the role fully and to participate knowledgeably
more continuity in terms with less demanding workloads that are focused more on policy with staff assisting with be helpful
has been too insular and has not done enough outreach to organizations such as the american bar association the national association of college and university attorneys the association of corporate counsel and similar groups
yet these are constituencies that have the power to help influence the creation of om buds offices
being too insular is problematic and impedes the ability to accomplish its mission
focus has been too internally focused with much debate about who should be member rather than how to get more members
this insular focus has been limiting
related concern is that many om buds are too insular within their organizations
most om buds have been asked repeatedly to do more with less and must still serve the visitors who call every day
yet think important that om buds consider how others in their organizations view them
it is often hard for others to know what om buds do because most of the time om buds operate confidentially or behind so to speak
so what om buds do and how they do it is often not well understood by others in their organizations and many om buds have not found good way to share the value of their role with others
addressing this problem should be high priority because om buds are largely powerless in their organizations
having others understand and appreciate the role of organizational om buds is critical to their long term success
the om buds function requires one to be independent and neutral but at the same time it raises the question of how om buds get support when they need it themselves
think om buds need both external and internal support
although om buds need support from others in their organizations they also need to help protect their role and function as well as supply them with information that they cannot get on their own
to combine these two concepts should be source of information to organizational om buds on how to foster greater buy in from the senior leaders of their organizations
in my view apparent reluctance to engage with the larger world is related perhaps consequence internal decision making process that is ill suited to the demands of the larger world
of course all of these observations are interrelated
with more members staff support and continuity maybe this would not be the case
however believe that the current decision making process needs improvement
members in general have fabulous om buds skills but those skills may sometimes do into effective organizational decision making for in the hurly burly of public policy formulation
believe that in order to realize vision an om buds in every major organization the association will need to claim place at the table in the larger public debate
that includes drafting legislation and formulating policy
accordingly should find better way to make decisions in the often fast paced and imperfect world of public policy formulation that is unfamiliar to many om buds
not only will such an effort take time and money it will require more flexible and responsive decision making
as many are aware was one of the people involved in efforts going back many years to draft legislation in texas that would help protect ombudsman communications as privileged
it was very disappointing experience because decisions needed to be made about how to respond to various situations and sometimes we could not get decisions made in timely because of any bad motives or ill will on the part of anyone in but because people responsible for making those decisions were working in context that required decision making style with which they were inexperienced and uncomfortable
my observation is that when we were faced with what were in my opinion and untruths the extended debate among participants over how to respond resulted in missing the opportunity to respond altogether
thus believe that if is going to venture into the larger world of public policy better decision making process will be necessary
is not yet giving its members benefits that professional association should offer
specifically the organization needs to improve its external support for its members
what does it do for its members that they do for themselves
there is little time for solo om buds and those in very small practice groups to consider or tackle the larger questions confronting the profession
as such should take the lead in dealing with issues that many of its members face but that individual members may be powerless to address
for example should be helping its members deal with the letter from catherine lh am on the assistant secretary for civil rights at the us department of office for civil rights
because did not take the lead in developing response everyone was left to his or her own devices
many us college and university om buds programs still do not have access to counsel so they were forced to deal with internal lawyers at their institutions on this issue from distinctly disadvantageous position
where was the engagement with the office for civil rights
not talking about having members necessarily present their cases themselves
needs to employ knowledgeable and professional help to develop strategy and respond in these situations
should provide more external support to urge those who create om buds offices to comply with best practices in setting up new programs
many programs are created by people who are not familiar with what an organizational om buds program is and who may want to accomplish some other purpose
help in trying to get programs to conform to the more standard structures that support the core principles that has articulated would make great deal of sense
those two journal of the international ombudsman association charles powerlessness in their own organizations and the idiosyncratic nature of many of the increased the vulnerability of individual om buds which can lead to erosion and depreciation of even good om buds programs over time
there are many reasons why this happens some of which have nothing to do with whether or not an om buds is doing good job
for example whenever there is regime change in senior administration or senior management an om buds program is at risk
om buds should always remember that their role is not source of revenue it is an expense item
there is jealousy and competition from other functions that believe they should be able to do what om buds do
in the face of this constant pressure and the failure of many om buds to have internal protectors it is hard for programs to resist the forces of erosion and devaluation
addressing this issue will require both and individual om buds to develop ways to help others understand the value added by the om buds office
om buds often understand how best to collect and present statistical data aka
yet everyone to whom an om buds the whole context in which most om buds increasingly data driven
all of the people with whom om buds interface look at data on every other function in the organization
management of every kind in every organization is data driven
so when om buds are presenting trend reports or annual reports or communicating the return on investment in the om buds office om buds need to be able to
this means knowing how to collect and analyze data to support observations or conclusions that help to demonstrate the effectiveness of an om buds program
an issue related to is the question of accountability
do not know of any other function in any organization that is not subject to routine or periodic audits or reviews and then held accountable
and so my question is how are om buds held accountable
collectively the om buds profession has not addressed this issue or developed recommendations for the audit review and assessment of om buds offices
think developing standards and practices under which third party audits may occur will help to both improve practices and demonstrate greater credibility internally
where we go from herein light of the sometimes harsh observations have made about and individual om buds practices would like to offer some suggestions about how both practitioners and can move forward and achieve their strategic vision of an om buds program in every major organization
knowing where you want to go is not enough there needs to be both planning and execution to achieve this goal
it is crucial that focus on growing membership and revenue
would urge the association not to fight over who is member or the types of membership categories
having philosophy working with partnerships working with corporate sponsors and finding models from other successful member driven organizations can help increase revenue
it is important that find way to provide more external support mechanisms for individual practices
one suggestion is to separate the certification of people from the certification or accreditation of programs
evaluating om buds for personal certification should be based on skills knowledge and experience
accrediting programs should be based on whether program complies with important journal of the international ombudsman association charles howard programmatic features
the goals of the larger profession will be better served by having an objective external program assessment that could bolster efforts by om buds to align operations with the key principles that support the best practices of organizational om buds
should consider revising its governance and decision making process to create longer terms for board members and to demand that they focus more on policy than operations
having staff to help implement and follow through with decision making should result in more manageable load for board members as well as less turnover
this will also help expand its outreach efforts to both its members and the larger world
for members should be the support that helps om buds do collectively what they cannot do for themselves individually
development of standard reporting categories was exactly that sort of effort
would urge to hold more conferences develop rebuttal packages for members to supply to their noncompliant organizations create informational packages for companies that might consider an om buds program and distribute updates and bulletins to members
and om buds would benefit greatly from finding collective way to sponsor research on many of the pressing issues facing the profession
host of dispute resolution programs at universities may welcome the chance to have topics for either or doctoral dissertations
sponsoring that sort of primary research or getting grants to sponsor that primary research could be very valuable
linkages that could come out of these endeavors could also be important
in similar vein institutions of higher learning should be offering more education about om buds
am aware of few university courses but there are far too few of them
every law school that prides itself on having dispute resolution program should be offering course on om buds
this is missed opportunity in terms of outreach to the academic world
one of the topics most in need of additional research is the development of better ways to demonstrate the value that om buds programs bring to organizations
this is common challenge faced by all nonrevenue producing functions that help organizations avoid costs
nevertheless needs to do more to gather data about how an om buds program creates measurable benefit thereby allowing om buds to provide the type of data analysis that many senior managers desire
developing subject matter linkages and outreach to other sectors is also important
for example what is being done to reach out to the healthcare world
every major hospital or hospital network in the united the prime target for an organizational om buds program and yet there is great resistance in the healthcare industry
so what is the strategic plan to address that sector
how do om buds and reach out to government
think part of that outreach could involve assembling focus groups including focus groups of senior executives
it might be helpful to have them tell us what they what they think they need to what would matter most to them about om buds programs
finding way to be engaged with what happens in washington dc also remains very important as is engagement with what is happening around the world
trying to address public policy from the perspective of the larger world is valuable
the must develop mechanism for external validation of what om buds do in order to enhance credibility in their organizations and in the larger world
without compromising confidentiality routine evaluations would be helpful in providing senior leaders with data for benchmarking
also having third party audit management letter as is common with other types of audits would help to identify ways to improve or issues to address
it is no longer realistic for the profession not to have way to hold om buds accountable for their work
privilege cannot be the sole support for ombudsman confidentiality
although do not think that claim of privilege should be overlooked where the law of the applicable jurisdiction and the facts can support it meaning the way in which program has been established documented and operated we should not overlook other bases on which to support claim of confidentiality
there are ways to legally support claim of confidentiality that may not be quite as strong or as all encompassing as recognition of testimonial privilege but which are easier to assert and more likely to receive judicial approval
for example offices can include language in charters brochures and elsewhere explaining that users of the office will abide by the principles on which the program was based
those principles would include not calling the om buds to testify with respect to confidential communications
likewise it should be priority for to help om buds obtain access to lawyers
speaking of lawyers it is clear that practitioners would benefit if more lawyers were knowledgeable and able to represent om buds
the knowledge involved in representing this strange structure known as an organizational om buds is quite nuanced and often requires breadth of experience
pro actively educating counsel about om buds work and om buds legal issues is critical as is enabling om buds programs to obtain independent counsel to advise them
it may be time to revisit whether the code of ethics and standards of practice still adequately serve purposes today
related inquiry should explore the interplay between the language used in these documents and other professional or ethical obligations that might apply to social workers mental health professionals medical providers attorneys or other mandatory reporters on topics such as reporting incidents involving risk of harm to children or where there is an imminent threat of harm
other professions have their own ethical guides and constraints
understanding how those professions have dealt with these vexing issues could help better evaluate its own principles and determine whether to revise them
for example have said before that one of the points take issue with in the standards of practice is provision which says an om buds should not breach confidence except where there appears to be an imminent threat of serious harm and where there is no other reasonable option
have long thought that the phrase where there is no other reasonable should be deleted because it creates fertile ground for factual discovery battle of what reasonable steps an om buds did or should have taken that would invalidate any confidentiality
journal of the international ombudsman association charles howard con cl us ioni remain an ardent supporter of goal of om buds ubiquity
believe the institutions in our society need this function and willing to help get there
needs to get bigger and stronger in order to grow this profession because of the need for it in large organizations all over the world
this is true especially because the profession of an organizational om buds is relatively new and it is operating in uncharted waters with significant forces arrayed against it
faces formidable challenges but with an action plan based on where the association is and where it wants to be think the ombudsman profession can make great progress

introduction research is widely viewed as essential to the robust development and credibility of profession
in recent decades professional and academic leaders in fields as diverse as health and human services education public services and business management have increasingly encouraged professionals to produce research to help identify strategies and interventions that best attain desired outcome sr yn es et al
some have even suggested that integrating empirical evidence into practice and policy decisions is becoming interdisciplinary professional et al
however fields vary in the extent to which they have produced bodies of research evidence that are substantial relevant and credible enough to be applied usefully in practice sai ni
like other fields the organizational om buds profession has been conducting and encouraging research on our profession for many years
caucuses and associations began forming in the levin ef in ley and carter and we have surveys of om buds practitioners on record dating back at least to ro we
om buds empirical research practice paradigm evidence based practice
journal of the international ombudsman association she reen
ten years after the formation and seven years since the organization framed formal research agenda it seems time for us to reflect critically on our progress as researchers and how to proceed from here
this paper offers perspective on the place of research in the organizational om buds profession with hope of supporting critical reflection
as longtime university professor and relatively new member of the community offer my view with awareness that have much to learn
first begin by examining the disparity between our repeated calls for research on om buds work and the actual research production
this entails reviewing ways in which the om buds profession has been promoting research and showing that the output of organizational om buds research has been sparse
second consider factors that have deterred the production of research on om buds practices in particular interpret the history of the field to illuminate why we have not yet produced more research contrast our history with the rise of the evidence based practice movement within other professions and identify current hurdles to conducting research on our own
finally share ideas for moving forward with research in ways that might help overcome our hurdles as well as sidestep some of the obstacles many other professions are struggling to surmount
where is all the om buds research
the current strategic plan acknowledges the importance of research and asserts its potential to help advance the organizational om buds profession
one can infer from the document that our profession recognizes the potential of research to contribute to the professional development and excellence of om buds practitioners help increase understanding visibility and development of organizational ombudsman roles and and and influence relevant to the profession
promotion of research is also expressed through its professional journal
since inception in its editors and authors have been advocates for om buds research
alan lincoln the founder and first editor wrote in the inaugural issue that would on research and issues for and about the om buds profession lincoln see also
in that first issue the journal published the universal reporting categories which special task force developed through research to help om buds consistently track the issues we address and in doing so produce evidence that can inform professional practice and policy decisions dale et al
in the years since has continued to push research forward
in the journal published research agenda that the board of directors had solicited
the agenda identified about thirty research questions organized under the topics of om buds om buds and lincoln ro we and
two years later under the editorship of david miller asked lincoln to write an educational overview of the research process in which he defined basic terms and methods for conducting research and aimed to inspire inexperienced researchers to conduct studies addressing questions in the research agenda lincoln
in that same issue miller described research as crucial part of building an enduring professional suggesting that studies may be used to identify repeatable om buds practices we can critically evaluate and develop
likewise current coeditor howard gad lin wrote in the journal in that is time to develop collaborative relationships with academic researchers
who can independently examine and assess the work that we do the way that we do it and the impact that we gad lin
despite the encouragement and advocacy for research within the om buds profession number of scholars have noted there is ample research on related alternative dispute resolution practices such as little empirical research on organizational has been published harrison lincoln smith
to assess the accuracy of this observation conducted two informal tests
first ran an online search for scholarly peer reviewed articles in major academic library databases for the period between and using the search term and related
this search resulted in articles with my search term in the title abstract or list of key terms
the list included nearly all the articles published in
negotiation journal and conflict resolution quarterly also contributed heavily to the list having published several articles by members including special issues on in and
to determine the number of empirical research studies present in these results further limited the search to include only articles designated as including quantitative and qualitative research resulting in eighty four articles
perusal of these articles revealed that in more than half of them ombudsman is peripheral topic rather than central focus of the research
this suggests that in the last fifty years only about forty scholarly empirical research studies focusing specifically on om buds professionals and practices have been published and indexed in the databases searched
of those most were studies of statutorily created or om buds who receive complaints serve advocacy functions groups such as individuals in long term care and nursing facilities ad ock
the list includes fewer than dozen empirical research studies that focus specifically on organizational om buds many of the studies came from university professor tyler harrison and his colleagues see harrison et al
these search results support the observation that published empirical research on organizational om buds professional practices is scarce
surprisingly even though the initial scholarly articles included numerous publications the short list of eighty four research studies did not include any
this discovery led me to examine the twelve issues of published between and to determine the number and types of articles that appeared
in conducting this second test defined leniently including any article in which the author described gathering empirical data surveys interviews etc
and analyzing it in some manner to address an explicitly stated or implied research question or hypothesis
did not include articles in which authors only summarized and critiqued previous scholarly literature or quoted interviewees without analysing what was said
there were ninety five articles in all excluding two messages from the president as well as the special published in
based on my inclusion exclusion criteria there were eighteen research studies percent of the total including several in the most recent issue
reasons for the scarcity of om buds research this section reviews the history of our field to consider why one cannot find more published research on om buds practices
it begins by reviewing how we developed into profession with practices that are based on the authority of expertise and tradition
compare our history to that of another profession social work which over time has become more reliant on empirical research evidence as basis for defining legitimate practice
also consider emerging signs that the om buds profession may be ready to follow similar path of change
second the section introduces the process of and considers challenges that hinder professions from becoming journal of the international ombudsman association she reen bing ham evidence based as well as some ways other fields are addressing these challenges
finally it discusses obstacles that believe om buds will need to overcome if we wish to move toward becoming an evidence based profession
the literature offers rich accounts of the history of the organizational om buds role ad ock gad lin howard levin ef in ley and carter ro we she lt on
here briefly review that history to suggest how om buds expertise became the basis for defining legitimate om buds practice minimal izing the importance of empirical research as potential resource
one of the striking features of om buds history in the united states is that during the early years pioneer practitioners had to figure out for little or no they should be trying to accomplish and how they should be doing it levin ef in ley and carter
government om buds offices in the were modeled on the approach imported from sweden which had to be modified to befit the needs of universities corporations and other public and private organizations during the social turmoil and public unrest of the late and ad ock howard
it was not until the that most business educational and certain government agency om buds were using forms of practice that came to be called the om buds model howard
these om buds were influenced by the rise of the movement among other forces which shaped their practices related to confidentiality investigation neutrality and judgment gad lin
these pioneer organizational om buds often were acting in isolation and without shared understanding of what entails drawing upon their previous training and personal characteristics to invent and improvise their roles gad lin levin ef in ley and carter
however as om buds grew in number they began to discover each other connect informally as colleagues and mentors share knowledge and experience form professional associations and write about and teach each other ways to handle issues and cases
these developments transitioned the budding profession into an era of striving to develop shared ethical codes and standards of practice
major driving force of this period was developing consensual definition of the om buds role and consistency in practices in order to advance the profession levin ef in ley and carter
once there were standards of practice in place that endorsed shift in emphasis apparently occurred from creating standards to enforcing them
today has established membership categories and certification procedures that afford lower status to om buds who do not or cannot declare full compliance with the standards of practice sops
many om buds perceive efforts to monitor and regulate om buds practices as necessary to advance the field particularly during period in which our profession is still defining and distinguishing itself et al
and still grappling with misunderstandings of the om buds role and services gad lin harrison harrison et al
other professions have similar periods of development in their history
social work scholars and for example describe the that have characterized their profession in the past century
the term practice paradigm adapted from thomas concept of the scientific paradigm refers to the fundamental ways in which members of profession think about and understand defines legitimate and
and suggest that practice paradigm on the authority of expert consensus and journal of the international ombudsman association she reen bing ham arose within social work in the
during this era social workers translated knowledge from casework into formal methods of practice and they understood legitimate social work to entail expert generated techniques that required formal training and
however researchers conducted few systematic research to assess the impact of these practices
in the and however social work experienced an effectiveness
several studies failed to find positive effects of social work interventions sending shock wave through the
the social work profession was growing rapidly government spending on social welfare had expanded schools of social work were proliferating and the knowledge and resources needed to support high quality research in the field were modestly increasing
however the political climate bred accusations that those in the field were wasting resources on social programming creating intensified atmosphere of and heightened attention to effectiveness within the profession and
social workers also had role definition concerns as they faced greater competition from other human services professionals
when faced with these accountability and competition strengthening capacity for research and avid calls for evidence of in the field initiated new foundation for defining legitimate practice in social work
this new practice paradigm would assess the effectiveness of interventions based on empirical research evidence and
the om buds profession is experiencing some currents similar to those that pushed social work beyond authority of expert as the basis for defining legitimate practice and toward new practice paradigm
in an insightful analysis of trends in the field susan kee young park et al
highlights developments that believe signal the om buds readiness for significant change
for example the standards of practice pivotal achievement have aided practitioners grounded the profession and may ultimately provide rationale for achieving legal recognition of confidential communication with visitors
however members engage in ongoing discussion about whether the sops need to be revised gad lin no ack sen whether they accurately represent and effectively guide current practices at the majority of our institutions and whether enforcing them through membership and certification restrictions is necessary or even appropriate et al
these discussions have been occurring in the context of change and uncertainty in the social organizational and legal environment
the om buds profession is growing rapidly and becoming more diverse including an influx of practitioners with graduate degrees in conflict resolution et al
who may be more prepared to conduct research in the field
in university settings recent interpretations of federal laws have produced new threats to om buds confidentiality necessitating efforts by some practitioners to defend their role within their institutions joyce
such changes foster uncertainty since state recognizes the concept of ombudsman privilege wholly as advocated by ad ock
in recent years difficult economic times also have made some om buds offices vulnerable to budget cuts and elimination intensifying the aspiration to assess value and effectiveness new comb
several articles have suggested strategies to assess and communicate usefulness and value bi ala park ro we sch en ck and and trickle of studies evaluating om buds effectiveness or success have appeared in the literature bomb in harrison new comb waxman see harrison for summary and critique of studies published before
journal of the international ombudsman association she reen bing ham in short when reviewing the history and current state of the organizational om buds profession and comparing it to the experience of another field with relevant and longer history it appears that we are approaching the fringes of possible practice paradigm change in our thinking about what we do and our grounds for defining legitimate practice
further movement toward such change would not expunge authority of expert and as foundation for our field but rather would displace it as the sole basis for determining what constitutes legitimate practice
since its inception has acknowledged the potential of empirical research to support and advance the profession
in recent editorial titled into miller wrote organizational ombudsman profession is increasingly embracing empirical techniques in furthering our understanding of who we are how we work and what we may
the practice paradigm on the horizon for our profession may be one in which definitions of legitimate practice are grounded in empirical research evidence
if so we should strive to acquire more knowledge of the path ahead so we will be better prepared to overcome any challenges along the way
the movement which was adapted from the medical profession et al
calls upon practitioners to integrate three elements as basis for assessing case and deciding how to proceed in the circumstances at hand professional expertise the preferences and values of the individual receiving services and the best available research evidence gamb rill mullen and st reiner
using this approach om buds would draw upon their knowledge skills experience and the standards of practice and combine these sources of professional expertise with the values needs and expectations of the visitor and consider rigorously produced research evidence to make practice and policy decisions
though the om buds profession may transition to an era that produces more empirical research places greater value on that have no assurance that this shift will occur
according to and after more than forty years of amassing large body of evidence supported by rigorous research methods social work still has not fully achieved its ambition of becoming an empirically grounded profession
in fields such as social work and nursing which have long embraced the ideal that practice decisions should be evidence based it appears that most professionals do not yet consistently draw upon existing research evidence in making practice decisions and new house et al
many authors have written about this phenomenon analyzed the reasons progress with has been slow see mullen and st reiner et al
and suggested research approaches that may facilitate progress ja yn es
the problem appears due in part to misunderstandings of how research evidence should be used
practitioners also have voiced practical concerns including the perception that there are not enough high quality research studies on which to make evidence based decisions and they have described having neither the time nor the necessary training and skills to critically interpret and judge the quality of the evidence that does exist
practitioners also express concerns that the available evidence is not always useful due to mismatch between the contexts and participants often represented in academic research versus the situations and people encountered by practitioners in actual practice mullen and st reiner et al
helpful developments within the evidence based practice movement include two applied research approaches that address some of the concerns about that practitioners have expressed
with journal of the international ombudsman association she reen bing ham origins in the has recently reemerged in professional fields such as health care social work and education
action research engages practitioners themselves in studying and influencing processes of change that affect them sull ivan he gn ey and francis
professionals conduct research on their own practices enabling them to gain knowledge about their interventions and develop practical solutions to the challenges they face miller
in educational settings for example professionals such as teachers school counselors or principals might information about how their particular schools operate how they teach and how well their students while conducting action research miller
with this knowledge they can then enact positive interventions in the school environment and on their outcomes
second response to concerns about the movement is the advent of practice based research which involves collaboration between professionals and academic researchers
this approach starts with the information needs of the practitioners ja yn es and assures that conduct of research and the generation of knowledge occur within natural practice ja yn es
this method increases the applicability of the empirical evidence that results from the research
the om buds profession can learn from the concerns about expressed by professionals in other fields and from the research innovations that other fields have implemented in response
such information can help us proceed with research in ways that attempt to circumvent problems others have identified
yet because professions differ om buds are likely to encounter unique obstacles and concerns needing responses tailored to our own circumstances
if we determine where we want to go and are aware of the challenges we may encounter along the way believe om buds will be well prepared to weigh options and choose productive path
although om buds professionals are arguably well positioned to conduct research on om buds practices some obstacles hinder us from doing so
one of these is shortage of time and money
om buds have heavy workloads and producing high quality research is time consuming and demanding
although gathering anonymous aggregate data about visitors and the types of issues they bring to the om buds office is not uncommon om buds seldom are expected to conduct and publish empirical research
nor is funding for research expenses common item in the om buds office budget
similarly many om buds have not acquired the knowledge and skills needed to conduct rigorous empirical research
unlike professions such as social work or nursing does not have an academic discipline and major
om buds come from variety of disciplines and there may be little common ground in their education and expectations for scholarship
this condition may evolve as graduates of conflict resolution and related programs continue to enter the profession
meanwhile we do not have cadres of scholars and graduate students busily conducting and publishing research in the area of
an additional challenge for om buds research involves ethical concerns that can inhibit the ability to solicit participants and obtain sufficient data to address research questions
one of these concerns occurs when the same individuals are asked to participate in multiple studies
although the organizational om buds profession is growing it is still relatively small as we conduct more research the risk of causing research fatigue among participants increases
this phenomenon may help explain why some om buds surveys have obtained response rates below percent which some method ol journal of the international ombudsman association she reen bing ha mo gists define as minimally adequate baxter and babbie because of the potential for response bias when response rates are lower
small purposeful samples are suitable for most qualitative inquiry which seeks to provide rich descriptions and deep understanding of phenomenon within specific context cres well for an example see levin ef in ley and carter
however for surveys in which results are to be generalized to the om buds profession low response rates increase the risk that the non respondents differ from the respondents in important ways
researchers need to demonstrate that sample is representative of the population from which it was drawn before they will accept and generalize the results with confidence abu bad er
an additional ethical concern that deters research participation and data collection relates to om buds confidentiality as standard of practice
because an organizational communication with visitors is normally confidential researchers may have difficulty obtaining approval to observe interactions with visitors in natural practice settings
many om buds feel it is also improper to disclose information about their interactions or interventions for the purposes of research
some may perceive such disclosure as violation of the sops and the trust even when identities remain anonymous
related concern involves maintaining the wellbeing of visitors and the integrity of their relationship with the om buds
people come to the om buds office for help and gathering research data could increase their distress
requesting participation in research may also be viewed by some om buds as introducing inappropriate pressure into the professional relationship
beyond the ethical concerns about participating in research there may be reluctance within the profession to become focus of study
om buds are not accustomed to having their practices closely scrutinized by outsiders gad lin and even highly experienced om buds may be uneasy about what research might reveal
beneath these other obstacles is this fundamental challenge the om buds professional culture historically has not regarded research as normal and necessary
in contrast to academic culture om buds only sporadically turn to research for generating knowledge about our practices
when individual om buds struggle with difficult case our custom has been to seek mentor ing and draw on the spoken and written expertise of colleagues and the sops
we have not habitually turned to the empirical research literature which is still too sparse to be confidently used to inform practice decisions
likewise when om buds collectively face problem or concern the norm has been to address it through discussion and group decision making
as the professional community continues to become larger and more diverse however this practice may be losing the capacity to be sufficiently egalitarian and inclusive
this change may create greater incentive to develop processes that integrate research methods and empirical research evidence into policy and practice decisions
increasing organizational om buds research here offer four suggestions that may help us move forward with research in the organizational om buds profession focusing on our crucial questions framing our questions theoretically conducting research in practice settings and supporting om buds researchers
starting place for becoming an empirically based profession is to revisit our research agenda
the research agenda provides general framework that is helpful in showing wide spectrum of possibilities for research
our next step is to narrow our inquiry to focus on more specific questions journal of the international ombudsman association she reen bing ham that are crucial to the profession
for example one category on the agenda is where we find the broad question strategies work
this question is so open ended that the prospective researcher is unlikely to know where to begin
to initiate the process of focusing our topic cres well offers advice to qualitative researchers that believe is useful for researchers using other approaches as well
he suggests we begin by reflecting on ourselves and what we bring to the research project
who are we what is our history what are our ethics and political predispositions and how do we perceive ourselves and others
what philosophical assumptions do we bring to the research endeavor and what theories guide our understanding of the topic at hand
with self understanding as backdrop we are prepared to consider what we want and need to know in relation to our topic
we must determine the specific purpose of the study our research questions and the the research needs to be done cres well
the research purpose may arise from practical issue or problem theory deficiency in the literature or other sources
reviewing the relevant scholarly literature is helpful at this stage to learn what is known about the topic and identify any deficiencies or gaps in existing knowledge
we can ask what unresolved professional puzzles keep us awake at night or what urgent or crucial problems are being discussed in the field
for example identified dissonance within one of the standards of practice related to neutrality sop
as described by miller asked at meeting do we reconcile ombudsman neutrality with being for fair and equitably administered
questions such as this one enliven the research agenda by narrowing the focus to specific problem or concern
our research question may become strategies can organizational om buds use to effectively reconcile om buds neutrality with advocacy for fair processes
once we have articulated what we want and need to know we can turn to research design choosing research approach and methods for gathering and analyzing data that will enable us to answer our research questions cres well
for example in our study of sop we could use qualitative approach and interview om buds about their strategies for successfully and unsuccessfully negotiating neutrality and advocacy for fair processes in specific om buds asking them to disclose information that would reveal or identity
our analysis of the interview transcripts could identify themes in the responses that describe their experiences with this issue and what strategies have been most useful in different circumstances resulting in empirical evidence that might help inform practice decisions
alternatively in quantitative study of sop we could develop written or videotaped scenarios of om buds interactions based on typical cases in which the om buds needs to advocate for fair process while maintaining neutrality for example an institutional process affecting visitors could be depicted as unfair
several scenarios could portray the om buds using different communicative approaches and the study participants sampled from population of interest could rate the approaches on measures of neutrality and advocacy
another option for creating scenarios is to train individuals to serve as park to present their issues to om buds who are participants in the study
the simulated sessions could be videotaped to enable the researcher and other study participants to rate the communication
the results could identify the messages that are perceived to effectively maintain neutrality while advocating for fair processes
the incisive and often quoted assertion is so practical as good lew in points to the value of theory to guide researchers in their study of the crucial questions of field
theoretical frameworks and perspectives provide unique lenses or points of view that can reframe our key issues and refocus attention on aspects of our questions that were not previously in view
as result theory can do much to spur researcher insight and creativity and foster useful research on om buds practices
the value of theory to explain and inform om buds work has been demonstrated in number of publications for example blo ch has son moore
theories from numerous resolution communication psychology counseling management sociology and many also provide inspiring ground for the study of om buds practices stimulating and framing our research questions
relational dialectics theory baxter and montgomery for example can be used to frame our question about reconciling neutrality and advocacy for fair processes
this theory from the field of communication views interpersonal experience as inherently contradictory
dialectics refer to the interplay of contradictory pushes and pulls in our interpersonal relationships the dynamic tension between opposites such as the desire for both autonomy and connection or both openness and privacy
the theory sheds light on how people struggle to make sense of experience and how we continually manage and negotiate oppositional poles
when applied to relational dialectics theory helps us reframe the process of assisting visitor as one in which it is normal to negotiate dialectical tensions such as the one between neutrality and advocacy
the theory encourages us to ask what the two poles mean to us how om buds experience the tension and communicatively manage it and with what consequences
an important lesson from the movement is that research should be conducted in contexts and with participants similar to the ones professionals encounter in practice
this helps ensure that the findings of research are applicable in practice settings
om buds can conduct action research discussed earlier in which we study our own practices
additionally we can welcome academic researchers from outside our offices and profession to conduct practice based research producing findings that are relevant and useful
studies in which researchers observe and evaluate actual om buds interactions with visitors through one way mirrors although controversial may be particularly instructive to our work
some of this research could focus on whether and how om buds enact the sops during sessions and to what effect
in study of om buds neutrality for example the researcher could observe interactions between om buds and visitors during initial sessions and rate statements on scales measuring neutrality
researchers might also record sessions with visitors allowing researcher to do detailed analysis of how the om buds maintains or deviates from neutrality during different parts of session
researchers could also examine variables such as types of visitors and issues which might affect the neutrality ratings of communication
for example researchers could assess visitors and om buds on identity variables such as gender and ethnicity and examine how the types of visitors and issues as well as the identity match between om buds and visitors might influence om buds neutrality
visitors also could rate om buds neutrality post session including short term and journal of the international ombudsman association she reen bing ham long term outcome variables such as trust in the office willingness to recommend it to others and perceived effectiveness
as discussed earlier significant concerns regarding confidentiality as well as nervousness about what research might reveal pose potential obstacles to studies of om buds work
however confidentiality concerns are likely to be resolvable and should not become excuse for shielding ourselves from critical gad lin
each academic researcher is required to obtain approval from his or her institutional review board before asking people to participate in research
an mission is to ensure ethical protection of the rights and welfare of human research participants
this typically includes requirements that om buds would insist upon such as informed consent for research participation confidentiality and privacy and their right to withdraw at any time the removal of any identity markers from data that must be securely stored and timely destruction of data when research is complete
number of strategies could be used to promote om buds research and offer sustenance to those who conduct it
approaches that are tailored to support and encourage individuals who have different levels of research expertise may be helpful
for independent researchers who are already experienced and knowledgeable the profession could offer competitive grants as well as significant time at conferences and with computer technology to speak to the profession about their work
we also could develop procedures to help researchers obtain representative samples of study participants without overburdening any particular group of professionals
such efforts could be made alongside calls for research by our professional journals
could expand communication within and outside the profession to encourage submission of research articles and perhaps strive to publish certain number of rigorously conducted empirical studies each year
individuals with little research experience can receive support through opportunities to become educated about research methods at our conferences and meetings
could also develop workshops and short courses to train om buds in how to be discerning consumers of research enabling them to determine what research evidence is credible to be used as basis for practice decisions and how it can be incorporated
eventually academic minors or graduate certificates in might be designed within disciplines such as conflict resolution and communication with research methods as part of the required curriculum
one way the profession could assist researchers at all levels of expertise is by encouraging research collaboration
this could start with an survey identifying concerns about obstacles to research as well as specific problems and issues we believe need to be studied
could also promote the formation of independent research teams composed of individuals with complementary knowledge and skills to conduct ongoing om buds research
these teams could be multidisciplinary and could include academic researchers who are not om buds themselves working closely with practitioners who might not otherwise have the time and training needed to conduct research
ultimately combination of approaches and strategies will likely be necessary to promote significant increase in the amount of research on om buds practices both within the profession and in related academic fields
journal of the international ombudsman association she reen bing ham conclusion the organizational om buds profession appears to be nearing crossroads
we have an opportunity to think critically about the future and what kind of profession we want to become
reviewing the history and goals of other professions is helpful yet the uniqueness of our profession calls for path created from our own history mission character ethics challenges and aspirations
we need courage not only to speak out about concerns joyce but also to ask ourselves difficult questions
believe one of those questions is whether we are content to advance further as profession without substantial body of empirical research evidence to inform and support our work
second and equally compelling question is whether we are willing to do what it takes to produce such body of research evidence
these questions should not be answered hastily because moving forward with research will require the profession to change
om buds tend to view the critical analysis of our profession as involving processes of self reflection and communication with colleagues
in contrast there has been tendency to envision empirical research primarily as tool for gathering information about ourselves that is validating we have been less likely to consider empirical research as tool that can facilitate our critical thinking and improvement
yet foundation for critical analysis of practices may be one of the most valuable resources body of research evidence can offer profession
producing such research requires practitioners to open themselves up to scrutiny with awareness that the findings may not always show what they hoped for or expected
if the om buds profession aspires to begin grounding our practice and policy decisions in empirical research evidence there is third question we must have the courage to ask are we ready and willing to benefit from what the research will provide
journal of the international ombudsman association she reen bing ham notes
he international ombudsman association uses the word to refer to the om buds role but explicitly welcomes use of alternative terms
use and because believe in the power of language to shape meaning and am more concerned about the effects of such language choices than their origin or intent
research across disciplines suggests that using the form for example mankind congressman tends to conjure primarily male images in minds
the two primary associations that merged were the ombudsman association toa and the university and college om buds association
evidence based practice involves professionals in process of incorporating research evidence into their practice decisions rather than relying only on professional expertise and the values and concerns of those receiving service

however research from number of other fields such as mediation psychology organizational development and counseling has potential relevance to om buds practices
the searched databases included academic search complete communication source public administration abstracts and business source complete
unpublished ar tic les and articles published in journals that have been discontinued or renamed were not included in the available databases
for example excluded journals included the journal of health and human resources administration which published many articles by mary ro we and other prolific om buds authors
however journals originating outside the united states were included such as in fan cia journal for the study of education and development and scandinavian journal of caring sciences
at the time of this search in early all issues of except the second issue of volume had been added to the library databases
om buds also need to respect the limits imposed by their institutions when making practice decisions
in the model skillful adaptation to institution would be considered an element of
response bias occurs when the survey respondents are different from the non respondents in ways that might cause the results to be skewed
representativeness can be established through probability sampling methods or statistical techniques that compare the characteristics of the sample with those of the population to which generalization will be made

the definition or assessment of would depend on the research approach and the methods used for gathering and analyzing data
the qualitative researcher also could interview other groups and stake holders within the institution to explore their experiences with the strategies and the effectiveness of those strategies
research may also be used to refine theories and even to generate new theories on om buds practices as illustrated in research using the grounded theory approach for example see
relational dialectics theory would also be useful framework for studying the paradoxical nature of conflict and how om buds help visitors integrate polarities such as competition cooperation optimism realism and avoidance engagement mayer

journal of the international ombudsman association abstract organizational ombudsman programs are increasingly recognized as hallmark and best practice of highly effective organizations
this article expands on white paper that has been used as guiding and benchmarking document for ombudsmen and the study of integrated dispute resolution systems
it outlines basic features of the organizational ombudsman role including its key standards of impartiality confidentiality independence and informality as well as the three main functions of problem identification and assistance organizational critical self analysis and promotion of conflict competence
the article further elaborates on the hallmarks and practices contributing to the effectiveness of ombudsman programs that not only identify systemic issues and root causes of problems but also act as catalysts for change to improve the workplace through use of and proactive engagement
integration of these elements into ombudsman programs facilitates proactive and engaged model of practice that can contribute to more efficient productive and collaborative organizations
ombudsman organizational change mediation conflict competence soft power smart power systemic issues root cause change agent collaboration proactive engagement
bark at blueprint for success designing proactive organizational ombudsman program journal of the international ombudsman association john bark at when organizations experience crisis situations it often becomes clear that the seeds of disarray began with series of mistakes ethical improprieties poor business practices minor legal or professional infractions or escalating personal conflicts
yet most of these antecedents to corporate meltdown were visible to employees who felt powerless because they did not find safe place to share concerns or resolve issues before they escalated
many successful organizations of the st century however are taking proactive steps to foster organizational resilience and are recognizing that by listening to employee concerns and providing safe venues where they can raise issues organizations can increase their overall effectiveness productivity and long term sustain ability
key function that serves as confidential employee resource and early warning tracking for problematic trends is an ombudsman program
indeed recent edition of just resolutions an american bar association newsletter about dispute resolution focused on the role of the organizational ombudsman highlighting its emergence as viable and critical role for organizational health
likewise reflecting on the post en ron era the wall street journal highlighted the timeliness and value of establishing corporate ombudsman offices
it is notable that this model is being accepted not only by government and nonprofit entities such as the united nations the international labour office and the national institutes of health but also among organizations for which profit is the primary business goal such as the coca cola company shell oil company and mars inc
in fact mars inc recently was rated twenty two on the list of the best multinational work places
in her keynote address to celebrate that placement victoria mars herself the former corporate ombudsman credits the active ombudsman program as one of the reasons why it has had such success
such examples suggest that creating an organizational ombudsman program makes good business sense
the concept of an ombudsman is understood in variety of ways
to many the ombudsman serves as corporate conscience constantly pushing and prodding an organization toward fairness and good practices
to others the ombudsman represents the true scales of justice weighing both sides of disputes and helping to facilitate solutions that are acceptable for all
others view the ombudsman as complaint handler
still others see the ombudsman as an internal consultant who provides valuable feedback for management
though each of these characterizations is accurate it is possible to more clearly define and understand the function
defining and understanding the focus purpose and scope of practice of an ombudsman can consequently inform the design of an organizational ombudsman program
this focus is to assist in the design of effective programs as well as highlight model of engaged practice that can add value to the organization and its stake holders
it contains guidance for practice as well as benchmarks for establishing new programs
good starting point for understanding the role of an organizational ombudsman is clearly defining what it is not
in foundational article published in the negotiation journal national institutes of health ombudsman howard gad lin offers an interesting and detailed analysis of some of the differences between the and ombudsman models
however for our solely on the organizational ombudsman few simple distinctions will help the reader understand some key differences
in most countries the classical ombudsman role is generally established by legislation to serve country state or city and serves as complaint or conflict handling resource who can formally investigate and issue findings about particular cases
the confidentiality privileges are generally articulated by statute
the organizational ombudsman on the other hand is generally established by an organization to serve as and an informal channel of resolution for given constituency
thus the organizational journal of the international ombudsman association john bark at ombudsman would neither conduct formal investigations nor issue formal findings
although both models have their place in the field of conflict resolution the model that has been expanding most rapidly is the organizational ombudsman model
the organizational ombudsman model fits into the structure of well designed conflict management system
any well designed system has as foundational elements both formal and informal systems
formal systems include human resources hr ethics legal management grievance panels hearing panels judicial boards formal complaint handling structures etc
on the other hand informal conflict management systems include the organizational ombudsman program confidential hot lines or voluntary mediation programs
any organization that provides for only one system formal or informal is not optimal and may actually engender more conflict than it resolves
yet an organization that balances its formal and informal complaint and conflict resolution processes has the basic tools to learn and grow from disputes
as part of the informal system the organizational ombudsman should function as an internal specialist whose role rests on four foundational cornerstones as specified by the international ombudsman association informality impartiality confidentiality and independence
supported by these cornerstones the ombudsman provides three vital functions problem identification and assistance organizational critical self analysis and promotion of conflict competence
four foundational cornerstones impartiality confidentiality independence informality the first cornerstone is impartiality
the notion that customers or employees will turn to an intra organizational resource to share personal or potentially controversial conflicts harassment or discrimination is bit unrealistic without this cornerstone
for example although many employees turn to human resources for assistance with information on medical benefits job orientation or transfers many are acutely aware that in the final analysis hr ultimately represents management
when company announces layoff the hr department implements the layoff strategies and management decisions
thus employees may hesitate to share serious concerns with hr in the same way they may hesitate to share concerns with others in the management structure
in contrast employees may find it more comfortable to approach the ombudsman who does not stand in the shoes of management unions staff or administration and who serves to provide unbiased feedback honest evaluation and the unfettered ability to listen objectively
as designated neutral the ombudsman officially represents no one and represents the
the ombudsman does not advocate for the employee or for management but rather for fair treatment and fair processes
thus the ombudsman serves as an independent internal consultant to the organization
as such care must be taken to ensure the ombudsman generally has no additional roles within the organization
such structure could be viewed as compromise of that potentially the confidentiality
in the absence of an independent internal resource employees frustrated with lack of options may turn to formal dispute systems within the organization external advocates or legal counsel each of which can lead to greater costs in multiple forms both for the employee and for the organization
this foundational element is critical to the success of the organizational ombudsman
without the cloak of confidentiality the inquirer to the ombudsman is journal of the international ombudsman association john bark at not likely to share fully or trust openly
because of confidentiality and the open sharing that thereby results an ombudsman can understand issues in more detail expose motives more readily and explore solutions that will likely be longer lasting and more effective for all
consider common concern that an inquirer takes to an ombudsman sexual harassment
in these cases the but not always have experienced trauma due to uninvited propositions or barely veiled threats
however balanced with the trauma may be her desire to retain employment and in many cases handle the situation in the most low key fashion possible
yet managers in many organizations are required to report and investigate allegations of sexual for the protection of the inquirer and other potential targets in the organization and also because the organization has been legally on when manager becomes aware of such allegations
regrettably many of these investigations propel the incident to the forefront of the organization and create visibility that the woman did not desire
furthermore although there is generally an attempt to treat the situations delicately when handled by most formal mechanisms she is often forced to provide evidence retell her story repeatedly and face cross examination by those defending the alleged offender
because these cases ultimately involve wider circle of participants over longer period of time including involvement of peer panels and quasijudicial boards word inevitably spills out into the organization
this can polarize members of the organization into camps those who support the alleged victim and those who support the alleged offender
this common unfolding of the process can essentially victimize the woman twice
there may ultimately be at what cost
because many people recognize that formal means of justice often carry such price they are sometimes reluctant to use these approaches
the alternative is that many issues remain submerged and go unidentified which may contribute to the festering and escalation of problems over time
in these cases the issues generally years and more venomous than they began causing even greater damage and incurring even greater cost to both the organization and the individuals involved
however when company establishes confidential resource such as an organizational ombudsman program employees may find safe harbor where they can bring issues forward and seek assistance in evaluating options
the ombudsman can identify specific issues while protecting the anonymity of the source can report on aggregated trends and can frame focus and channel concerns to appropriate institutional stake holders who can initiate the appropriate action or remedy
years ago when worked with south african colleague to help establish an ombudsman office she insistently and rightly demanded that the ombudsman office report directly to the top officer
according to her dog must have teeth
this vivid expression accurately identifies one of the key components of well designed ombudsman program that it report to the top and carry with it the full backing and support of upper management
in the performance of its duties such as searching for root causes of problematic processes and procedures and handling of sensitive issues the ombudsman office must be able to move unimpeded by the politics of the organization as much as possible
thus an ombudsman ideally reports directly to the governing board of directors while having access to top management
if structured this way reporting to the board the ombudsman can be free to work without fear of direct retaliation from someone to whom he or she if an allegation arises against the journal of the international ombudsman association john bark at office of the
furthermore it allows the ombudsman to more freely deal with issues surrounding people who may have been appointed by and report to the
it is quite problematic to have the ombudsman report to someone below the level of or president
if there are people positioned between the ombudsman program and the in the structure of the organization the ombudsman is less likely to be able to influence change at the highest level
deficiency in the reporting structure may also diminish trust in the services by potential users if they perceive that leaders do not value direct access and communication with the ombudsman
even if the ombudsman administratively reports to someone other than the he or she needs to have direct and unfiltered access to the and the board
key role of the ombudsman as noted is to serve as an informal trusted resource that can assist with resolution through various means such as shuttle diplomacy and mediation
one defining criterion of informality is that it allows the inquirer to remain actively in control of both the process and the decision making about outcomes
the ombudsman partners collaboratively with those seeking assistance in way that supports and empowers them to evaluate options and to then select course of action best suited to their situation and needs
in this capacity the ombudsman unlike formal channels does not make conclusive reports determinative findings or arbitrative decisions on grievance matters
although there is place for those roles in various formal grievance or resolution channels the ombudsman serves as counterbalance for such approaches and functions
by resolving issues informally parties have greater control and flexibility in framing the issues and crafting resolutions while also learning about and working with organizational needs and requirements
these cornerstones do not mean that the ombudsman cannot work andor contribute alongside others who have such formal or compliance roles
indeed close cooperation and exchange between such actors in the organization is sometimes facilitating lasting and effective resolutions
however in reality most organizations are reactive
they react to perceived or real risks or to lost litigations and resulting sanctions
in response they initiate new compliance oversight and formal grievance structures
the ombudsman therefore becomes an often role to balance these formal structures
three vital functions problem identification and assistance organizational critical self analysis promotion of conflict competence problem identification and assistance is the function most commonly associated with an ombudsman program
in this capacity an ombudsman is available to employees andor constituents to provide information to hear concerns or complaints to direct concerns to appropriate internal resources to help mediate interpersonal conflicts directly or through shuttle diplomacy to assist in untangling tough problems to propose or brainstorm possible solutions to coach visitors on how to strategically navigate turbulent conflicts or to simply communicate information upward in the organization
these functions are often the first priority for many ombudsman programs and are how the ombudsman office gathers its data becomes aware of issues and handles cases
journal of the international ombudsman association john bark at organizational critical self analysis pertains to what the ombudsman does with the institutional knowledge he or she gathers
although the ombudsman clearly maintains confidentiality by not attaching or revealing the names of inquirers to their concerns the program does collect and report aggregated data so the organization can critically evaluate and improve its practices
data may include general information on types of cases seen analysis of emerging issues or recommendations of general areas of practice or policy that management should address
because the information comes under the cloak of confidentiality and directly from various employees it is firsthand and fairly accurate however data often comes from small percentage of the much larger system
despite the small sample size this information often represents issues or concerns shared by others and can prove valuable to the organization in analyzing potential areas for improvement and in examining interventions or changes in management practice
promotion of conflict competence is the third vital function of the ombudsman
generally refers to awareness of attitude toward and ability to constructively handle conflict
the better equipped person is to deal with difficult situations the easier it will be to prevent mitigate and address conflict thus improving the work environment
individual conflict competence only in degree of competency but in the specific behaviors tactics and skills used to demonstrate competency as well as the comfort levels with each of these elements
simply conflict competence looks different for different people
many strong organizational ombudsman programs use the expertise available to conduct or coordinate efforts to educate train or coach employees and management on how to work together more collaboratively with their differences and thus promote conflict competence
it is common for ombudsman programs to conduct ongoing negotiation and mediation training for support and mid level staff to arrange intensive weekend retreats in managerial negotiation for directors and senior managers or to provide an executive seminar series for executive and upper level management
in this way the ombudsman program seeks to instill common language on the topic of conflict and collaboration for all members of the organization
this too can help the organization in its external relationships with vendors and customers as collaborative skills become the norm in all types of business interactions
the ombudsman as an effective catalyst for change proactive engagement enabling principles if the ombudsman program only served the three vital functions it would be useful for any organization
however the usefulness of the role can extend further
by the common practice of identifying systemic root cause factors the ombudsman office can use its unique position to not only draw attention to these issues but to ensure that they are carried to appropriate decision making bodies for consideration and action
in this process the ombudsman can shepherd the issues through the organization while providing useful feedback to the organization so it can consider possible remedies and reforms
while not beholden to particular solution the ombudsman is committed to ensuring that the organization considers issues fairly
this process builds on the useful but challenging role of an ombudsman as catalyst for change
the ability to stimulate beneficial systemic change and improve the organizational environment can be increased through the use of proactive engagement and enabling principles
journal of the international ombudsman association john bark at ph dc re ating change does not come easily
whether in political contexts or in organizations the process of change is rarely predictable or linear
the ombudsman role is designed to help organizations embody fair process
ombudsmen can have some power in this regard but all too often ombudsmen avoid or reject the concept of wielding power
in so doing the ombudsman limits his or her ability to effect change
joseph nye is political scientist at harvard university who has written about the notion of power in political contexts
as illustrated in figure he differentiates between three different types of power
nye describes what we typically think of as power as which is power through force or other types of coercion or payment essentially the power to pressure threaten or leverage
he then contrasts it to the power to change things by attraction or the power to persuade through charisma communication and other such means
however he recently noted the need for preferred strategy called
smart power uses elements of both hard and soft power as contextually and situationally appropriate
he notes that this power combines skills from soft power vision emotional intelligence and communication with the ability to use organizational capacity and political skill
to essentially combine these skills he adds sixth one that he calls which speaks to the knowledge of when to use the others
as it relates to the ombudsman smart power is particularly relevant in the exploration of options and the movement of systemic change through the organization
ombudsman programs are in unique position of power within an organization
they are privy to insights that allow them to identify trends in conflict and communications and to pinpoint areas of organizational design processes and culture that could be improved
furthermore they are positioned within the organizational architecture to not only communicate with all levels of employees but also influence systemic change
figure three types of power journal of the international ombudsman association john bark at however many dispute resolution practitioners disown most vestiges of power
power is almost bad one dare not whisper in the back corridors of alternative dispute resolution conferences
but the role is clearly intended to influence the organization and awareness of the influence would help the practitioner use it responsibly and strategically to increase the effectiveness
an ombudsman influences for fair process fair policies and an environment that recognizes and embodies the corporate values
it seeks to influence for transparency clarity and honesty in communications and participation and consideration of the views of people who are affected by managerial decisions
an additional perspective is that the influence an ombudsman has and uses through his or her function that is nonaligned nonmanagement nondecision making helps redefine the traditional perceptions and uses of power in an organization and helps bring focus to underlying values such as fairness and equity
an organizational ombudsman is influential and therefore has power
by embracing the power to influence and exercising an ombudsman moves beyond impartial observer and can passionately engage the organization at all levels
to do so it is essential that an ombudsman becomes experimental and takes risks in how he or she engages in organization
such engagement necessitates move from more passive role to more proactive one
the move from passive om buds ing to proactive engagement has four stages
these stages are shown in figure
in the first stage the ombudsman is passive focusing on casework but not necessarily making the connection between casework and the larger system or on enhancing conflict competence
putting this positively the sole focus is on working with the individual seeking help
the downside is that although the passive ombudsman may be able to resolve individual cases and improve individual situations the larger organizational system continues to function as it would have had there been no ombudsman
figure degrees of engagement journal of the international ombudsman association john bark at in the second stage the ombudsman is reactive
the ombudsman may work not only with individuals but may also begin to work with teams and groups
at this stage work may explore conflict coaching at the individual level and more broadly provide written tip sheets to guide others on how to resolve issues collaboratively
the ombudsman may also draft periodical report that identifies issues based on the cases seen
the limited engagement phase is where the conflict resolution role and the cases handled provide the data for the systemic issues identified
in this scenario the ombudsman may issue report that goes further than simply identifying issues or problems it may include recommendations on types of changes that the organization might explore to address the problems
at this phase the ombudsman may also actively provide training to various constituencies in the organization to enhance their collaborative skills
finally in the proactive phase there may be an even greater emphasis on the systemic nature of an work than there is on case handling
not only would recommendations be made but the ombudsman would sit and engage side by side in an informal role with staff and management to help shape path to improve the organizational culture
he or she would also serve as communications and conflict coach for senior management and provide assistance during major change or crises
furthermore the ombudsman would remain vigilant about ripple effects and help the organization consider unintended consequences that may come about as result of such changes
in this stage initiatives move beyond only providing the occasional training to one that actively works with other areas in the organization such as internal training units to foster an organizational emphasis in conflict competence
the ombudsman can further work with human resources employees to include conflict competency in both hiring criteria and as measure in the performance appraisal process
it is important to note here the relationship between the organization and the ombudsman
although the ombudsman serves as catalyst of change an agent to reframe issues the change agent itself is the organization
it may be helpful to illustrate this spectrum by taking look at how given scenario might play out in practice by contrasting the passive and proactive engagement methods
imagine that staff member approaches an ombudsman with situation where he or she is facing relational challenges with supervisor and an impending performance appraisal where the discussion may be difficult
the passive process might see the ombudsman listening and laying out various options such as living with the situation as is or interventions such as writing note to the supervisor communicating directly andor evaluating various options of how to proceed through the difficult appraisal discussion
in the end the staff member leaves to select and pursue the option of his or her choice
at the other end of the scale proactive engagement the ombudsman may indeed begin with the same approach
however in session he or she may provide some coaching to the staff member on how to navigate difficult discussion and subsequently conduct role playing to reinforce the skill in practice session before the staff member raises it with his or her boss
additionally the practitioner may reflect on the case by conducting root cause analysis and probe for underlying causal factors beyond those involving the two individuals staff and manager
in so doing and in conjunction with data from other cases the ombudsman may discover that the process of performance appraisal has several problems including the fact that both midpoint and yearend reviews are not regularly completed and often managers are reluctant to provide honest developmental due to fear of being the target of staff filed grievance or because they feel the process is too time journal of the international ombudsman association john bark at consuming
the ombudsman may further verify that although the performance management tool was intended to be developmental the company uses the tool as mechanism to determine which staff to retain because of period of downsizing
this has created climate in which staff regularly fight to challenge any review that notes developmental the point where they grieve or litigate such reviews claiming harassment by managers
as result the ombudsman may draft feedback for the human resources department noting several areas of concern shared by both staff and managers regarding the performance appraisal process
he or she may also request that the company form committee to review the process and that the ombudsman serve on the committee in an informal nonvoting capacity
the ombudsman may also review the number of appraisal related cases grieved or litigated and when noting an increase consult with senior management to review the risk register for the company to see if the issue could be more closely monitored
the ombudsman may suggest that management explore risk mitigation strategy
the ombudsman may work with the training unit to encourage development to contribute workshop on difficult conversations in the appraisal process
the ombudsman would then also be present when the human resources department proposes process revisions to senior management committees on which the ombudsman participated in order to provide feedback on any new reformulations based upon the cases seen and the problems related to the issue
the ombudsman notes the issue as systemic issue in his or her annual report and gives briefing first to the committee of the board of directors that reviews risk management and second to the committee that reviews audit and hr issues and to which the ombudsman regularly reports
in each of the proactive and engaged steps taken by the ombudsman in this example the role is to influence which issues are on the table and to ensure that they are framed discussed and acted upon in ways that focus on the real underlying problems are transparent and include involvement by all those affected by the process and any resulting changes
the ways in which ombudsman programs can use influence and to enable change are considerable
they urge flexibility in processes they urge for fairness of rules they seek to improve situations without blame they point out the underlying interests when parties become intractable they promote procedural justice they urge examination of solutions that might be different novel creative or undervalued and they seek to encourage input of all parties engaged in issues
all of these things resonate fully with the core cornerstone principles
an ombudsman can influence passionately and pro actively and still be well grounded within the role
in order to exercise or transition into proactive role an ombudsman must regard the guiding principles as enabling principles not inhibiting principles
one who views these principles as inhibiting may consider the principles as or or absolutes
this absolute way of approaching work might look something like this journal of the international ombudsman association john bark at table
absolute perspective principles impartial ar ti al advocate confidential vs
sour ce of disclosure independent vs
formal the danger in thinking of the principles in absolute terms could be to apply them too rigidly or literally which can be limiting
the principles which are to inform practice end up becoming the goal to serve the principles
the risk is that an ombudsman could begin to look for reasons why he or she could not do things
and with each demurral and withdrawal the ombudsman becomes less relevant to the organization loses opportunities for engagement and is less effective at the portion of the role designed to serve and to improve one of the key constituencies the organization
ombudsman programs operate in multitude of locations internationally and within organizational settings which are multicultural and diverse
the ombudsman must therefore be allowed the space to observe professional standards with practice that offers flexibility and that functions effectively
instead of instilling an ombudsman with caution and fear the principles should inform his or her practice and give the ombudsman courage to engage the organization where he or she works
the principles should allow an ombudsman to think about all the ways in which he or she can engage rather than all the ways in which he or she cannot
instead of viewing principles and practices as absolutes one might find value in viewing them all as important but nevertheless with relative weight compared to each other with some being more critical to the of what makes an organizational ombudsman
from that point one can examine the relative weight of each principle and its effect on practice
this framework helps an ombudsman reimagine the principles and practices
the framework still considers the principles as core but allows one to prioritize them according to what may be more central to the role in relation to the others
likewise the framework also recognizes that although the practices stem from the core they are not as central as the principles and thus can also be prioritized according to the needs of the role
this idea is shown in figure
figure prior it izing principles and practices journal of the international ombudsman association john bark at one way an ombudsman might evaluate the weight of each principle is by assessing how well one could still perform the key functions of the role if the principle were limited in some way
for example propose that informality might emerge as more central than the other principles in defining practice because if the role were to become formal grievance channel and arbitrate for example the ombudsman loses its unique distinction it is hard to imagine how any of its other functions could remain credible
however very important be absolute and allows for more latitude
for example many ombudsman practitioners have exceptions to confidentiality based on state regulations or other laws
nevertheless if this is clarified up front in their charter or terms of reference as well as in communications with the constituents they can still perform most of the key functions of the role very well
the principles may be weighed differently but they are all foundational
on the other hand practices should have flexibility
for example part of the ombudsman role is promoting positive organizational change
yet ombudsman practices have traditionally also evolved toward absolutes such as not serving on committees or never having lunch with people in the organization
although there is certain degree of importance ascribed to being viewed as impartial there are nevertheless ways to accomplish this without having to isolate oneself
successful organizational change means that the ombudsman office must first identify systemic issues and subsequently work with key decision makers to explain the impacts of systemic issues in manner that is understandable and can lead to action
therefore providing impartial and independent input on committees or having lunch with key decision makers can be important ways for the ombudsman to influence the organization
however adherence to maintaining confidentiality of the to defend the ombudsman practitioner or be practice that is more core and central
an ombudsman should remain vigilant about what practices he or she needs to be effective in the role which is about more than protecting the four principles
well designed and proactive ombudsman office incorporates all elements discussed above into model in which the ombudsman is actively engaged with the organization
as shown in the model in figure there are three areas of focus problem identification and assistance organizational critical self analysis and the promotion of conflict competence
to help carry out this unique role the has articulated four enabling principles to guide the ombudsman along the way
these principles should inform the practice and give courage to engage the organizations in which one works
if the ombudsman is able to engage the organization then the practice becomes the means to achieving the and emboldened by the principles
the result or payoff is that through proactive work on informal resolution an ombudsman can help resolve individual issues collaboratively and informally identify areas for improvement within the greater system and contribute to culture in which employees are skilled and competent in handling conflicts that arise in global and diverse workplace
by working to improve the environment of an organization an ombudsman is able to influence change in its systems policies procedures and culture

copy models from similar organizations without improving assumes that similar business type has well functioning ombudsman program or grievance structure many times similar organizations are struggling to their own programs due to lack of foresight and planning look at other models for good practices but replicate entire model every organization is different even if in similar industry seek out structures from other sectors government corporate academia where great innovations may be taking place principles as goals instead of guidelines ombudsman looks for reasons why he she cannot do things ombudsman becomes less relevant to the organization loses opportunities for engagement and is less effective in improving the organization view the principles as important but with relative weight compared to each other and on practice prioritize principles according to what is more central to the role in relation to the others although many of these have been mentioned in passing and are included in table few are worth highlighting
addressed this element briefly in the discussion of independence but it bears some elaboration here
clearly as noted the would involve having an ombudsman program report directly to the board
must stress that because the ombudsman program is meant to be impartial it does not have any direct policymaking ability
thus it is important that the program have referent power from the key power holder in the organization
most organizations recognize this fact by not only having the program report to the top but also by ranking andor paying the individuals who serve in an ombudsman role at rates comparable to other top executives who report directly to the chief officer or to chief compliance officers or auditors who report to the board
it is also critical to the success that top management publicly articulate support for and confidence in the ombudsman program
the ombudsman by having finger on the pulse of the organization can provide input to those who form corporate policy
by virtue of the ombudsman hearing issues firsthand from all parts of the organization he or she is in privileged position to compile and to add value to these data so the organization can improve for the benefit of all
by isolating oneself and failing to interact with or participate in committees and groups concerning organizational change the ombudsman loses the opportunity to provide information and understand issues which can be helpful in any change process
thus the ombudsman should be actively involved in his or her impartial and independent role with groups and entities that create policy or seek to improve the work environment
the ombudsman can participate on these committees or with these entities as an organizational stakeholder
however when the ombudsman participates in these ways he or she should take care not to approve new or revised policy or to make other final management decisions for the organization
the ombudsman is there to provide information so that managers can make better decisions
likewise although the ombudsman engages with decision making entities he or she should also meet with staff members to ensure that they have an opportunity for input in decisions and organizational changes that will affect them
when the organizational ombudsman model first became popular in the there were few practitioners
in the infancy organizations assumed that an ombudsman would be someone internal who was good problem solver and was generally well respected
there was virtually no pool of professional practitioners to draw on and every organization had its ombudsman function differently
as result many developed shortsighted practices such as requiring the ombudsman to be retiring employee or other individual who was given fixed and limited term after which he or she could not continue working for the as the ombudsman
such practice overlooked the importance of continuity and often resulted in ejecting strong and skilled practitioners at the end of their contracts in favor of those with less skill and experience
since then the ombudsman role has been professionalized
the professional associations that represent ombudsman such as the have aggressively identified best practices and articulated these in their standards of practice codes of ethics and best practices
thus for organizations that adhere to these standards there are certain commonalities and consistencies of practice and function
additionally in recent years the has established professional certification program for practitioners that establishes knowledge of practice and adherence to standards of practice
journal of the international ombudsman association john bark at furthermore these associations have identified relevant skill as experience in mediation understanding of group dynamics training in organizational development and expertise in collaborative can contribute to success in the role and to the broader organization
for example has designed comprehensive training program that explores basic skills such as ombudsman conflict management and ombudsman case handling in its foundations of organizational ombudsman practice course its advanced training courses explore systemic interventions and organizational diagnosis
today there is an understanding that the ombudsman is specialist in role that is increasingly professionalized requiring certain demonstrable competencies
ombudsmen can hone their relevant skills by interacting with specialists who have common experience and expertise in organizational ombudsmanship in spite of differences in background of sector organization type or business purpose
thus hiring practices have moved toward seeking skilled professionals and specialists especially from outside the organization to develop and to direct ombudsman programs
and with increasing recognition that conflict competence is critical managerial skill organizations have benefited from having ombudsman practitioners subsequently serve in other roles in the organization
when taught management classes to graduate students would often pose this question where does an organization most clearly articulate its priorities
inevitably most students recited common answers such as its mission statement corporate vision or other articulated management principles
rarely did they name the place where believe an organization most accurately identifies its priorities the budget
by its allocation of resources an organization articulates where it is putting its support and in what proportions
thus an organization that claims to its employees may not actually do so in practice if there is little or no funding allocated for job training continuing professional development or comprehensive benefit plans
the organizational ombudsman is an easy office to publicly support
after all who would not want to offer employees safe place to go to resolve employment concerns
however it is easy for management to do this in token fashion by appointing an ombudsman in title and then not providing further support in budget or staffing
to do so is disservice to the entire organization employees do not fully receive the promised resource and management loses valuable source of critical feedback
further the organization does not get consistent early warning signals of underlying problems
an ombudsman program must also have sufficient allocation to be able to operate independently without relying on other areas to function effectively
well designed offices should have budgetary support that allows for subcontracted assistance for particular cases
for example an ombudsman may become aware of an employee who does not feel safe after harassment and may need temporary use of an emergency cell phone
or perhaps manager who is facing an uprising from staff needs external coaching to resolve particular type of issue
other examples of budgetary considerations include expenses for regular travel to various organizational sites meeting and hospitality budget support for separate toll free hotline regular professional development for ombudsman staff and maintenance of resource library of books or videos to assist managers and employees with tough issues such as handling concerns of discrimination or communicating better with supervisor
most organizations staff human resources offices quite well
in fact they are likely to have many subprograms within hr
similarly well designed ombudsman program provides number of practitioners especially in mid to large sized organizations
having an adequately staffed ombudsman office benefits the organization itself
not only are conflict resolution practitioners more likely to truly cases develop them and follow them through to resolution but several analyses have revealed that the cost savings provided to an organization by having an effective ombudsman program pays for the function at minimum and most likely saves in indirect costs
the composition of those practitioners ideally mirrors the mix of faces within the organization in terms of gender ethnicity age and language
in this way employees can seek out the ombudsman with whom they feel most comfortable
many well designed programs such as at the united nations or the national institutes of health not only have multiple professionals and support staff but also offer additional staffing support
for example organizations such as baker hughes and american express provide for conflict specialist who does not serve as an ombudsman but serves as professional staff member who takes the aggregated data and creates value added reports
other organizations provide for specialists within the ombudsman area who are dedicated to training or other efforts of the function
comprehensive systems allow for multiple entry points
this includes the need for an adequate array of formal grievance mechanisms it can also include employee assistance programs internal or external or equal opportunity functions
however not all complementary mechanisms need to involve hiring employees or creating programs
an organization can show its commitment to mediating employee disputes by supplying impartial external professionals prior to litigation
it can set up toll free hot lines to provide assistance or information for employees
or it can create town hall forums in which employees may share concerns and identify solutions to common problems
having multiple points of entry into conflict management system encourages direct collaborative methods for resolving problems
when system skews heavily toward formal systems the organization sends message that formal methods are the preferred path of resolution which discourages less formal channels of resolution
furthermore many organizations are now recognizing that approach to conflict management systems is preferable to the approach
in typical zero tolerance approach the organization has no tolerance for specific designated acts or speech within an organization
as result the actions or speech trigger formal and indiscriminate response which can discourage employees from reporting such issues
thus many issues that might easily have been resolved through informal methods of conflict resolution either go unreported and unresolved or escalate beyond what was necessary for an effective resolution
however the approach attempts to provide as few barriers as possible that would keep people from using resolution channels
it recognizes that an organization that provides many points of entry into resolution and result in more issues surfacing and consequently more resolved issues
the organizational ombudsman explains to every inquirer that in the role of organizational ombudsman he or she will protect confidentiality and resist any participation in formal processes such as testifying
yet occasionally the ombudsman of its intimate knowledge of particular difficulties within an be named as witness in formal grievance or litigation
although it is the responsibility to protect the ombudsman program from testifying in these forums many organizations use their existing legal programs to assist the ombudsman program
ideally the ombudsman program receives external legal counsel to protect its independence and its obligations to practice without advocating for
this approach reinforces the fact that the organization truly supports the independence of the office and avoids conflicts of interest if the ombudsman office has knowledge of confidential inquirers about which the organization would like to know
furthermore the dedicated legal counsel can support the ombudsman program in issues of proper setup and operating procedures by reviewing the charter or terms of reference and communications to the organization and by offering ongoing support for assistance on legal issues that if shared with the counsel might reveal sensitive confidential cases or identities
corporations and other organizations commonly out source various functions as part of their efforts to control costs
for many programs this can be viable way to save costs and retain the equivalent function
however the uniqueness of an organizational ombudsman program is that it is indeed an internal that is part of the organization in which it works
this is critical for several reasons
first part of the role is guiding employees on the formal and informal bureaucracy
although an outsider can learn the formal structures the internal politics and unspoken norms are nearly impossible to ascertain from the outside looking in
an ombudsman must be placed so that he or she can have knowledge about the systems people and culture of the organization
also most corporations recognize that consultants in their role as change agents are often of the and therefore use their input when it is of interest and end their contracts when it is not
it is still much harder process for an organization to dismiss an employee rather than temporary consultant
by being placed in the organization the ombudsman has the ability to work side by side on daily basis with managers and employees and to serve as the institutional memory reminding management of issues they must address
an organization that uses an out sou rc ed ombudsman may not recognize the role and value of the function and may be viewed by employees as only paying lip service to the importance
small organizations may be the exception
however even in this circumstance the organization and its out sou rc ed ombudsman would do well not to function or label the role as ombudsman but to work as conflict resolution consultant
this distinguishes the limitations inherent in an external out sou rc ed function from that of an
when an organization decides it must out source the ombudsman function it should ensure that it enables the individual to become familiar with the organization to have access to all internal decision makers and stake holders and to have enough contractual protection against retaliation by the organization or its members
journal of the international ombudsman association john bark at conclusion the organizational ombudsman program is rapidly becoming an essential and critical function in government education corporations non profits and nongovernmental organizations ng os
however for every office that is well designed and planned there are other examples of shortsighted planning and insufficiently supported programs
fortunately most offices established in accordance with generally accepted international standards and practices and with solid management support behind them will have good foundation
if they are able to add the elements of proactive and engaged ombudsman program they will not only be well designed but will also be able to demonstrate their value to the organization and its employees and affect the work culture and overall effectiveness
looking forward organizations are facing new challenges in the form of an increasingly global and diverse workforce increasingly litigious environments less job certainty and employee loyalty and increasing pressures in balancing both work and family
it is appropriate then that organizations are focusing on how to handle conflict and implement appropriate systemic changes in the workplace by revisiting the proven model of an ombudsman to meet these new challenges
this trend represents the willingness of organizations to operate in ways that are more transparent and responsive in order to develop strategies that strive for self improvement fair treatment of people and ultimately improvement of whatever bottom line is used to measure the success
with careful planning the proactive and engaged organizational ombudsman program can prove to be key element in the successful organization

this is not intended to demean the role of human resources or the fact that hr professionals seek to represent employee concerns
rather it is simply to stress that many employees misunderstand the role of hr and this misperception causes employees to feel frustrated
furthermore hr professionals sometimes feel frustrated by not being able to please employees
it is the view of the author that hr functions are critical to corporate and organizational health and indeed are first cousins so to speak of ombudsman programs
in many organizations the ombudsman and hr practitioners become close and supportive collaborators who understand and work together to build upon their complementary roles
for an excellent article about the roles of ombudsman and hr refer to the williams and red mo nd article ombudsman program governance and trust in restoring trust role in corporate governance
in some instances such as universities an ombudsman who is also faculty member may continue to teach course while serving as ombudsman
in organizations which have several individuals serving in the ombudsman role it could be possible to mitigate second role by having another ombudsman handle issues arising from the second collateral function
journal of the international ombudsman association john bark at
to ensure full confidentiality and freedom from having information about visitors used in formal procedures or litigation an ombudsman does not accept notice on behalf of the organization in which they work
dual roles jeopardize the claim to confidentiality and create uncertainty about when an ombudsman is and is not an agent of notice
as mentioned confidentiality is often statutorily articulated for the classical ombudsman in most countries
confidentiality for the organizational ombudsman in many countries may more often be supported by common law
also in many organizations employees are explicitly made aware of the confidentiality of using the ombudsman program during new staff orientations or in employee manuals and other materials
according to employment law of some countries this might constitute an implied contract between employer and employees which in some countries may also serve as legal support for confidentiality
frequently used benchmark is for an ombudsman office to see least of the eligible population
joseph nye power hard power and
ro we role in dispute resolution
the practice of term limits stems from pure classical ombudsman models which often investigate and may issue conclusory findings on case by case basis
however the organizational ombudsman does not issue such reports or conclusory findings as result of formal investigation
for organizational ombudsman programs operating as an informal resource term limits do not make sense and if used are often renewable and can allow for rehiring in different role
the prevailing practice to not impose such limits is supported in an international survey of organizational ombudsman programs
results of the compensation and ombudsman practice survey
thus also the outdated practice of hiring retiring senior executives or faculty is now considered somewhat questionable
the fact that most offices now hire specialists recognizes the particular skill set and competencies needed and also recognizes that there are reputable university programs in negotiation conflict resolution and organizational development addition to specific ombudsman training equip such specialists
furthermore there is the potential of the perception of conflict of interest inherent in hiring someone who has served as part of an administrative team or faculty who might now be required to sit in the role of an impartial party in disputes involving former managers or colleagues or in cases where their own prior input in organizational governance decisions could be challenging where he or she is the sole ombudsman

these are some of the same issues that have come to the fore in discussions about online dispute resolution technology and dispute resolution generally all of which have implications for practice and ethics for ombudsmen and other dispute resolution practitioners rain ey
other technological developments have affected and will affect the ethics of the profession but none of the game changing technology that may be applied to dispute resolution in the future seems to be general topic of discussion among current ombudsman practitioners
the risks and down sides are discussed at length the opportunities seem largely ignored
we have been asked to survey current practice to comment on the use of technology to enhance the work of ombudsman offices and to look ahead to where the practice of the ombudsman may be headed given the rapid advance of tools being developed for use in general dispute resolution
in fact more than one person has said wish said after has demonstrated the flaws in her or his vision
the risks notwithstanding we feel confident in predicting that technology will feature prominently in ombudsman practice in the near and distant future

we can cite examples of ombudsman offices that blend current practice and the use of later in this essay but that is not the status quo for most ombudsman offices
in this discussion of the future of ombudsman practice we will use as shorthand reference for the array of hardware and software available to ombudsmen and others in the business of conflict engagement
the term dates from the mids and the development of ec om merce with its attendant virtual disputes and is connected to the concept of the reference to the active role that technology plays in conflict engagement systems that use to conduct all or part of their work
in an essay on the use of technology by ombudsmen fowl ie argues that there are two basic ways interacts with ombudsman offices through technology there are two basic branches of both based on the role of technology
the first branch may be called
technology based refers to those systems where technology plays an active role in conducting the dispute resolution
these would include blind bidding systems or ec om merce systems such as those developed and employed by
the second branch of consists of technology assisted solutions
technology assisted refers to the use of technology to augment alternative dispute resolution processes that exist independently of the technology
fowl ie can fundamentally affect the way ombudsmen do business
technology assisted takes human based functions and actions that currently exist in ombudsman offices and uses to fulfill those functions or engage in those actions
following are examples of how the ombudsman offices of three organizations are using technology the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers ic ann the us army medical command med com and the us national mediation board
the ic ann office was established in november creating an ombudsman office for ic ann was challenging and was not possible using only current non technology assisted practices
the ic ann ombudsman is an executive ombudsman serving inside the ic ann organization but the office receives complaints from stake holders outside the organization
fowl ie notes that by definition participants in ic ann are online users as the role of the organization is to administer the domain name system which is the addressing backbone of the internet
disputes that occur within ic ann may be either in the real world or online in nature
unique element of the ic ann office of the ombudsman is that it serves literally global community
ic ann stake holders come from every nation in the world and span all time zones
as the ic ann office of the ombudsman is sole practitioner office it would be impossible to be operational hours day to communicate synchronously with journal of the international ombudsman association complainants
however using an online case management and communication system complainants the organization and the ombudsman may engage in asynchronous communication
asynchronous communication may be described as parties sharing communications that are not direct and real time
for example complainant in asia may use the to initiate complaint while the ombudsman is sleeping in north america the ombudsman may then respond to the complainant after office hours have closed in asia
the also allows for the collection and analysis of data for statistical reporting
during the case intake process information such as the country location and category of complaint are recorded
in closing the complaint the ombudsman designates the resolution type and confirms the complaint category
these statistical records help to identify complaint trends that may assist in providing early intervention on systemic issues
fowl ie the ability to collect and aggregate data particularly in offices with large volume of casework introduces some interesting issues of ethics including issues related to privacy and rain ey
the army medical ombudsman office is mixed executive organizational ombudsman office serving patients medical staff patient families and the public
in the army medical command was faced with set of challenges that called for upgrading and repairing physical plants and for establishing ways to elicit and respond to input from the soldiers families and medical staff concerned about the care given to returning veterans
part of the ultimate solution was the creation of an office
on february the washington post began publishing series of articles about the deteriorating conditions at the walter reed army medical center in washington dc federal facility that housed many of the wounded soldiers returning from iraq and afghanistan
consultation between the leaders at med com and group of dispute resolution practitioners working pro bono led to the creation of an organizational ombudsman office using standard best practices to serve the med com community
ultimately the office that the med com community created serves as an example of mainstream current practice
but some of the challenges faced in setting up the office illustrate the need to take advantage of
first the community served by the office is scattered all over the world
this is more and more feature of organizations that might benefit from the work of an office
for example at recent american bar association meeting the ombudsman from pharmaceutical company spoke of the growth of his office growth largely driven by the need to serve corporate members in multiple countries
second the med com office exists in strongly hierarchical organization in which contacts to report problems or to seek help may be potentially viewed as could affect the status or career of an individual who may have information that the ombudsman and the organization may desperately want to know
in short it is likely in many organizations that for reasons of dispersal and culture members of the community will approach ombudsmen only if there is way to contact the ombudsman without having to go to physical office andor if there is way to contact the ombudsman that is truly anonymous
daniel rain ey frank fowl ie journal of the international ombudsman association to address these issues med com launched its ombudsman office with very strong web presence including portal that allowed contact with the office from anywhere at any time
it also included as part of the portal the ability to leave information for the ombudsman anonymously by using secure message area that the community member could access without entering any demographic or individual data
at its inception the office had physical locations at ten posts in the united states and italy
currently the office is staffed in thirty locations in the united states and around the world
the national mediation ombudsman office more traditional organizational ombudsman office does not serve an all online community but it relies on technology similar to that in place at ic ann and med com to offer access and case management for employees contractors and members of the public
access to the ombudsmen at the may be through in person contact in the offices in washington dc by phone or email directly to the ombudsmen or through an online portal that allows contact via text messages that may be left either with or without attribution
it is essential for employees to be able to contact the remotely
the mediators are on the road about three weeks each month traveling to the parties with whom the agency works who are scattered across the united states
the combination of direct attributed contact and anonymous contact offers the public and employees access twenty four hours day seven days week
in addition to ease of access use of the online contact and case management portal allows mediators to track trends and manage cases
these three examples of mixed current future practice offices and the technical adjuncts they management asynchronous communication and trend assist and augment the human based activity in handling complaints
fowl ie notes however that the ombudsman process is still driven by the human based activities of investigating developing questions options and recommendations and communicating findings and reports
in addition to relying on technology assisted future ombudsman practice is likely to be affected by the rise in solutions for broad range of dispute resolution endeavors
early technology based systems have tended to rely on straightforward decision trees and algorithm driven systems such as the blind bidding system used by cy ber settle for insurance subrogation
online retailer an early developer and user of algorithm driven systems reportedly handles million disputes per year using human intervention in only percent of those cases rogers
the explosion of ec om merce has created an online community that experiences disputes at rate at least equal to those who operate in the offline world with needs that do not parallel those of the traditional commercial enterprise
those involved in ec om merce have had to develop solutions because traditional face to face solutions cannot reach those who have disputes in cy ber space
daniel rain ey frank fowl ie journal of the international ombudsman association even though current systems are simple by some standards the impact can be significant
for example anecdotal discussion of dispute resolution systems including ombudsman offices indicates that many who make contact are not seeking mediation or some other direct intervention
using technology based systems to point individuals toward the body of information they seek fulfills those needs and it helps ensure that the practitioner is interacting with those who actually want and need direct contact
it is almost inevitable that most ombudsman offices will employ algorithm driven technology based systems especially those that serve large organizations with large number of contacts
it is very likely that the use of much more sophisticated technology based systems including systems using the developments emerging from the field of natural language research will affect the ways ombudsmen practice in the future
very broadly stated there are two main branches of natural language research
one branch is concerned with the ability of of one kind or to and understand the spoken or written language that human beings use with each other
practical use of this research is the development of programs such as dragon which allows you to your computer what to do with voice commands
the other branch is concerned with ability to and understand vast amounts of text or voice communication and analyze the content
this research is being used to develop ways of telling false positive and negative reviews from genuine reviews on web commerce sites and it is being used to determine whether there is anger agreement etc
in given mass of text or voice communication
in the near future dispute resolvers including ombudsmen could use advanced speech analytics and natural language research to look for aggressive or attacking language to help them make sense out of mass of communication from large numbers of individuals
advanced technology also offers interesting possibilities as an adjunct to coaching
it is also conceivable that technology based evaluation tool will be able to scan proposed message either written or spoken to give one party guidance on how that message may be perceived by another party
as with any application of information and communication technology there are two parts to the technology employed by systems and ombudsman using hardware and software
it is important to consider these separately
hardware refers to the machinery ombudsmen or clients use for example lap tops tablets or smart phones software refers to the computer programming used to conduct the processes
the availability and use of hardware affects the reach and complexity of the program using technology
in north america for example computers and tablets traditionally have been the main source of computer based activity but mobile devices are increasingly taking over the hardware market
february report indicated that americans used smart phone and tablet ap ps more than to access the internet last first time that has ever happened
europe is also seeing similar pattern of shifting use from static devices desk tops and lap tops to mobile devices
in africa and asia smart phone use is far more common than use of lap tops and desk tops
for designers of programs in general and for ombudsmen in particular the continuing shift to mobile devices as way to connect to the therefore to services offered by conflict engagement that mobile ap ps and mobile friendly methods of data and information entry and access are key to reaching potential clients
daniel rain ey frank fowl ie journal of the international ombudsman association one cannot predict what hardware will be in front of us in five or ten years except to say that it will likely be cheaper and more powerful than
as we will note later the type of hardware available to the constituents of an ombudsman the access to that into the evaluation of whether to use technology what it may be used for and how to integrate it into an ombudsman system
the software for both static and mobile devices is continually improving and there is global tendency for developers to create their own programs or software and make those available to wide audiences
for specific target audiences developers now commonly use to develop applications that address specific issues or problems
for example recent hack at hon in austin texas took client service issues put forward by legal aid and over weekend developed online approaches specifically responding to those issues
ten years ago we did not have the term small specialized program downloaded onto mobile devices in our common language
today it is almost axiomatic to say an app for
as we will note in detail later the broad array of software available to the ombudsman makes it possible for ombudsman offices to use software that is self contained and designed to fulfill all of the functions common to dispute resolution systems and it is possible to join independently produced ap ps and programs to target specific functions
for example the ombudsman office uses basic web site as an entry portal where potential clients can see contact information privacy and confidentiality statements and the charter of the ombudsman office links take the user to separate secure program where here or she can leave information either with attribution or anonymously
neither the web site nor the secure communication program was designed with ombudsmen or dispute resolution in mind however they easily handle several functions that must be fulfilled by the ombudsman office
thus key issue for ombudsmen who wish to use technology to improve their practice is to decide what kind of software to use
the speed at which both software and supported hardware are changing and improving along with falling cost factors will help ombudsmen decide which type of software or platform is most appropriate for their practices
first ombudsmen should embrace technology because as we have noted earlier in this essay their clients will expect the same level of access to ombudsman services that they have to other services
although it may be considered the age of potential contacts for ombudsman offices seems to make difference
younger clients seem to show higher preference for interacting online with friends strangers and service providers than older individuals
although this too may seem these clients and the generations to come after them will be the clients who seek ombudsman services
second ombudsmen should embrace technology because it offers efficiencies in current practice and adds new capabilities without radically changing the nature of the work
the advantages of technology assisted work should be obvious
using the three examples from earlier in this article the ability to make contact regardless of time zone or geography to accommodate disabilities with remote contact and communication and to engage in case tracking and management are clearly advantageous to the ombudsman office
daniel rain ey frank fowl ie journal of the international ombudsman association technology assisted is scalable to the needs finances and technical competencies of dispute resolution programs
web portals and online survey forms can simplify and speed up intake information gathering and scheduling
online discussion and document sharing ap ps can enable asynchronous communication for ombudsman offices spread over large geographic areas
document sharing and single text editing programs can make producing settlement agreements easier and more transparent
for each of the functions of the typical ombudsman office there is an app for that
and there is client base willing and eager to use the app
on the surface it would appear that most ombudsman offices would have little need for technology based
however in those instances where significant percentage of contacts are seeking assistance that can be provided through access to information documents forms or other static items technology based can play an important role in conflict engagement practice
for example recent conflict engagement design project concluded case flow analysis with the following note if the normal case flow is approximately cases per month and if of those cases actually now result in direct contact from
staff it is reasonable to assume that
staff at least cases per month
if one further assumes that of those cases result in simple furnishing of forms or other very basic information it is reasonable to assume that the number of cases requiring personal interaction with
staff member could be cut by per month without reducing the number of overall cases and without compromising the nature of the information pushed to the clients
neither technology assisted nor technology based work takes the place of human contact but rather uses technology to improve the efficacy of human based processes
third ombudsmen should embrace technology because it puts some important issues up front
most ombudsmen are already using some technology in their practice even if that technology is limited to smart phones laptop computers and email
intentional and thoughtful integration of technology into an ombudsman practice would not just offer the advantages we have outlined it would also ensure that ombudsmen were carefully considering the impact of the of which they are already issues such as confidentiality and privacy
since the advent of desktop computers before they were connected to the internet technology has changed the definition of and availability of records personal information and information that both the ombudsman and client would like to keep confidential
thoughtfully integrating technology into practice helps the ombudsman and any other dispute resolution professional directly address these issues with clients or parties and forces the development of policies and procedures to adapt to the digital environment
daniel rain ey frank fowl ie journal of the international ombudsman association what should the ombudsman consider when adopting technology
fowl ie argues that ombudsmen may wish to consider number of criteria when planning to implement or when considering the sc al ability of their programs
the following criteria will inform ombudsmen about the technology they will need to conduct successful od ras sist ed or practice fowl ie legislative case management users and complaint literacy and internet time service client or audience synchronous and asynchronous usage to that previous list we add two factors perceptions of safety and the need for anonymity and the sociocultural context
powerful incentive to use any conflict engagement program including ombudsman offices is the degree to which the potential client feels safe
safety can be defined in many ways by different client groups but at base the potential perception of the risk involved in contacting the ombudsman will factor into the decision of whether to trust the ombudsman
some clients will have no second thoughts about walking into physical office in front of everyone
some will balk at walking into an office but will use phone to contact the ombudsman remotely
some may stay away unless there is way to offer information anonymously
it is possible theoretically to set up where potential clients can drop even then he or she may fear being seen by others as the is made
for some potential clients true anonymity may be the key to initiating contact
from through the university of massachusetts am her st and the national mediation board conducted research to see whether the use of process modeling could support conflict engagement practice
among the conclusions from the research were that the use of technology did not diminish the feeling that their concerns were by the third party and the other party in the dispute and that using an anonymous system increased the amount of input from participants
one good way to craft truly anonymous portal into an ombudsman office and to craft an anonymous portal that is familiar to and trusted by an internet friendly population is to use technology
ombudsmen wishing to implement systems should also consider the general sociocultural context in which they operate
there will be differences in communication and culture between and societies
this will help inform the ombudsman of the potential for success
the system must be designed to accommodate the cultural requirements of the client group fowl ie
daniel rain ey frank fowl ie journal of the international ombudsman association for example several assumptions attend the north american model of mediation that informs much third party practice including ombudsman work for those trained in north america or europe
there are assumptions about the need for issue identification which can be seen as attaching blame in some cultures and assumptions about having the involved in the resolution process which can be problematic for collectivist cultures
using technology may in some cases be better fit for nonwestern populations than traditional face to face practice
ombudsmen might have to modify their practices to accommodate in number of ways creating an appropriate case management and correspondence system
this could be purpose built system or could simply be an existing email program
housing the system on separate secure server independent of other applications within the organization business or government
ombudsmen are also increasingly using secure environments for conflict engagement work
being proactive in providing web site that promotes the ombudsman function and links to the complaint intake case management system
the web site should contain reasonable amount of self help information to educate inform and assist potential clients
having native language translators available for complainants
community resources may be available to assist
translators must be covered by either privacy laws or nondisclosure agreements to keep the correspondence they review private and confidential
being prepared to develop effectiveness measures for using
developing sense of self and their own culture as they work with online documents to conduct dispute resolution
in this case culture refers especially to how people develop sociocultural context to the manner in which they resolve disputes
practitioner needs to be particularly aware of his or her own culture while working with clients or institutions that are different from them in the high context low context scale
in scenarios ombudsmen must be prepared to allow each correspondent to display his or her own conflict culture without the ombudsman forcing complainants to adopt the conflict culture
allotting time and energy to working with complainants who have low general or computer literacy skills
the same skills used in active listening may be applied to
practicing writing skills that will assist in developing environment
being aware that correspondents may tend to stray from core issues and processes with the written word
much of the process will involve focusing on these core issues and using the many tools in the ombudsman toolbox to develop options and possible outcomes
conclusion our basic prediction for the future of ombudsman practice parallels the trend in and conflict engagement in general
as online dispute resolution leader colin rule argues we now routinely use computers for many of our most intimate communications largely because smart phones and tablets have become so convenient portable and easy to operate
these developments will inevitably affect the practice of dispute resolution
technology is changing not only the way we communicate it is altering the way we disagree and the way we resolve our disputes
is no longer is arguably the future of
rule we echo the prediction about the future of in the field of generally and specifically suggest that is no longer novelty in ombudsman work it arguably will hold central place in ombudsman practice
daniel rain ey frank fowl ie journal of the international ombudsman association finally we suggest that anxiety over the of the ombudsman practice is misplaced
technology does not destroy the process
as has become more and more central part of private and professional lives there has been tendency to see the integration of technology as destroying something rather than building something
we think that the following observation made by rain ie and wellman is accurate and should give comfort to those who engage in profession based on people connecting with people
we wonder about the folks who keep moaning that the internet is killing society
they sound just like those who worried generations ago that tv or automobiles would kill sociability or sixteenth century fears that the printing press would lead to information overload
while sky is makes for good true
the evidence in our work is that none of these technologies are systems
they are being incorporated into social lives much like their predecessors were
people are not hooked on are hooked on each other
when they go on the internet they are not isolating themselves

online dispute resolution technology communication negotiation virtual conflict resolution computer mediated communication mediation online dispute resolution and om buds bringing technology to the table
technology is transforming the way in which people live and work
individuals all over the world now communicate effortlessly with each other via powerful computers they carry in pockets all the time wirelessly connected to the internet which by habit are still called
these devices have eliminated lot of the geographic barriers that previously constrained interpersonal communication and as result daily working relationships now stretch around the globe and cross multiple time zones
but people are just as complicated on either side of an internet connection as they are face to face because computers erase all the things that make humans complex and emotional
disputes can still arise between coworkers even if those coworkers have never met each other in person technology now enables those disputes to transcend time and space
if the services journal of the international ombudsman association colin rule in du sen of ombudsmen are to stay relevant in this newly wired world and tackle the phenomenon of conflict in cy ber space ombudsmen must learn how to leverage technology to transcend time and space in similar fashion
ombudsmen are in the communication business
the reality for many ombudsmen is that they already work across offices time zones countries and regions administrative field and other types of organizational with populations that have diverse communication needs and styles
although they may not be able to meet every single need to be effective they must be able to diagnose root causes of conflict and miscommunication then identify what can facilitate communication in given situation
it is an important time to ask where technology falls in the scope of the organizational work including whether ombudsmen are aware and can make better use technological tools that can improve dispute resolution processes reach and services
these questions also highlight the reality and impact of technology on workplace communication
as advocates for improved methods of communication and conflict resolution within their organizations and as communication channels themselves ombudsmen must develop greater understanding of how technology can positively affect conflict resolution
communication relationships and technology when dispute arises between two individuals or within group the first thing that comes to mind for most om buds is communicating with the person who raised the concern carefully evaluating options including whether it may be possible to have the parties sit down and work out the problem through direct communication
it is safe to say that most people who gravitate toward ombudsman work are people who are good at facilitating this kind of in person interaction
as such the idea of using technology to convene discussion can at first seem impersonal and strange
common questions may include how can we be effective in our role if we see the parties or read the emotions in the room
how will earn trust from the person without the intimacy of an in person meeting
technology make facilitating the conversation more difficult or serve to dehumanize the interaction between the parties
how can ensure that the parties remain engaged with the process
how will be able to ensure confidentiality
how can be sure that technology will not become an additional hurdle to overcome
twenty years ago professional dispute resolvers were quite skeptical about using technology
the sense was that technology only enabled sterile antiseptic communication stripped of real honesty and emotion
many people argued that online apologies in particular were not as effective as face to face apologies because of the lack of nonverbal communication
the oft expressed concern was that overly simplistic software solutions would trivialize disputes and suggest that disputants could just click their way out of any issues they encountered
as such dispute resolution professionals were very slow to adopt technology into their practices and many insisted that face to face communication was the only real way to conduct conflict resolution procedures
over the past ten years however technology has
the tools used to interact with each other in the realm of computer mediated communication have become far more intuitive and easy to use while at the same time becoming more powerful
devices like smart phones and tablets have made interaction as simple as pointing finger which for many seems more natural and human than typing on keyboard
computers now play pleasing sounds and show pictures and video in stunning clarity and color
technology has gotten much better at connecting with people journal of the international ombudsman association and helping to connect people with people
in response people have started connecting more with technology to facilitate communication and relationships in contexts from family to the workplace
though it does not replace the need for in person communication and nurturing technology is adapting to evolving human needs and interests making communication available and accessible where it may not have been in the past
as result the times and our culture are changing rapidly
the purpose of this piece is not to judge whether such changes are or but rather to recognize that they are happening
computer mediated communication is now used in ways that would have seemed inconceivable decade ago
not only is video conferencing used to say good night to kids when parents are on business trip some even text message spouses when that spouse is in the next room instead of just walking over to ask question
members of the younger generation in particular have become reliant on technology in almost every area of their lives
not only do they use technology throughout their workdays become comfortable using it in many of their most intimate personal relationships
as such when dispute arises many people now expect to be able to use the same kinds of tools to address issues quickly and effectively
technology is built into our daily lives so thoroughly that for many people not using computer mediated communication to address workplace dispute would seem weird
yet many mediators and ombudsmen remain skeptical
hesitation versus reality of needs within the field of conflict resolution there is still hesitation about integrating technology into informal dispute and conflict resolution processes
often online dispute resolution or is presented in manner that suggests there is bright line between online dispute resolution and face to face dispute resolution and that dispute resolution process has to be either one or the other
but that distinction is something of false dichotomy
in reality many of us switch back and forth between online and face to face communication all the time
it does not feel strange to speak with someone face to face then look down to send him or her calendar invitation from phone then have him or her accept the invitation and send back document while getting into within the space of few minutes
this is true within the workplace as well
staff may choose to send em ails to coworker in the next out of convenience but also out of courtesy to not interrupt coworker in the middle of task he or she is focused upon
it may also be important to have record of that communication something that is not created with phone call or in person
these approaches have become so common that they are not even noticed anymore
dispute resolution processes are not necessarily so different
organizational ombudsmen may follow policy of not creating records that identify the person who brings concern but in truly party empowered process perhaps the parties to dispute can decide themselves that they want to handle some of the issues over email or via text other issues over the phone or conference call and other issues at an in person meeting
in practice an ombudsperson may initially engage with the parties over email to coordinate meeting then shift to phone then engage face to face before shifting back to phone for followup and using an online feedback form for receiving feedback on the services of her office
our parties balance between these different forms of communication every day in their working lives and they will expect that their neutrals will be similarly comfortable moving between these different communication types
there is no need decide whether to handle dispute resolution work online or offline because parties are already comfortable using both
in fact individuals are already learning to sort their interactions into different communication chan colin rule in du sen journal of the international ombudsman association ne ls based on the nature of the relationship in question
as ombudsmen work in more global and fast paced organizational environments with diverse sets of constituents they encounter different communication styles relationships comfort zones preferences available tools and other practical needs
it begs the question of what tools can be provided to enhance communication for regular ombudsman practice as well as tailoring to specific needs and preferences and how technology can support such efforts
for example how can technology facilitate communication in setting up and conducting meeting with someone who has hearing impairment and lives on another continent
what can offer practitioners many lessons about how to effectively marry technology and conflict resolution come out of the field of
when first began about years ago many providers just replicated face to face processes in software
but those of us who experimented with those software tools quickly realized that some face to face dispute resolution processes work well online but others do not translate at all
the discovery of software algorithms opened up exciting new possibilities to assist parties in resolving their disputes
ethan kat sh professor from the university of massachusetts am her st who is widely regarded as the of described these possibilities in his book online dispute resolution labeling them the where technology earns seat at the table alongside the human neutral the third party and the disputants
this idea of technology as fourth party has become foundational concept in the practice of
the fourth party can assist parties in variety of ways as they move toward resolution
for example fourth party can provide information and set expectations for the parties in an impartial way that third party cannot
software algorithms can also enable variety of different types of communication from text based asynchronous conversations such as email to text based synchronous conversations such as chat
software can also enable audio and video conversations via tools such as sky pe and go ogle hangouts
these tools can enable participation from individuals anywhere in the world saving them the time and expense of travel and increasing the participation and engagement of disputants
fourth party tools can offer online joint document editing such as go ogle docs where parties can collaboratively author documents or online that help parties explore their options or provide early resolution for before the complainant even informs the respondent about their concerns
software tools can quickly address simple misunderstandings before they escalate or offer library of creative possibilities to help parties craft their ideal solutions
every year technology gets more powerful and more intuitive making the fourth party an increasingly helpful presence at the negotiating table
there is little doubt that more advances are just around the corner
technology as tool for facilitated processes asynchronous communication one of greatest capabilities is its ability to enable text based asynchronous processes such as in mediation processes to accommodate the needs of certain types of conflicts and dispute resolution processes
asynchronous communications such as email open up some exciting possibilities in conflict resolution
in an asynchronous dispute resolution process technology is tool that gives access to the process to parties they can participate from different locations and at different times rather than participating in real time interactions
for instance in mediation process sessions are often held jointly with both parties sitting at the same colin rule in du sen journal of the international ombudsman association table
if the neutral wants to have private conversation with one of the parties the neutral needs to pause the joint session and begin caucus session sending the other party out of the room for certain period of time
there are often sensitivities around how much time the mediator spends in caucus with one party versus the other party
if the mediator sends party out into the hallway and talks to party for twenty minutes and then switches parties and speaks to party for only five minutes that can create concerns in both parties
is the mediator showing favoritism to one side versus the other
is the mediator putting more pressure on one side to ease his or her demands versus the other side
in contrast in an online asynchronous process three conversations can take place at the same time
one conversation is joint discussion between both parties and the mediator the second conversation is private conversation between party and the mediator the third conversation is private conversation between party and the mediator
the parties can post messages into each conversation at any time
this ability is sometimes referred to as
it may be that party is not interested in having extensive private conversations with the mediator and does not post very much in his or her private caucus conversation
party on the other hand may want to post lots of messages in the private conversation perhaps because he or she has never been in dispute resolution process before and has many more questions about what is going on
because party and party have equal access to the mediator they have no concerns about asymmetries in the amount of time the mediator spends with each of them in caucus conversations
however the mediator is free to spend as much time as is required for the effective administration of the resolution process with each party in their private channels
another benefit of concurrent caucusing is the ability to get private feedback from the parties even when it appears the conversation in the joint discussion is going well
in face to face dispute resolution processes the mediator is often reluctant to caucus with the parties while progress is being made because of the risk that such caucus would slow down or derail the joint problem solving that is occurring
however one of the parties may have misgivings or concerns as the process moves quickly toward proposed resolution and the lack of private communication channel may make it difficult for that party to raise those concerns
an asynchronous conversation with concurrent discussions enables the mediator to check in with the parties even when the joint conversation is going well which may enable the mediator to be more aware of concerns that may potentially derail resolution or interfere with further adherence to an eventual agreement
asynchronous communication is not only helpful to parties it can also benefit conflict resolution practitioners
one of these new capabilities is to enable the mediator to dynamically reframe negotiation communication between the parties
in some of the face to face mediations the authors have conducted emotions run high and parties have made comments that were intentionally hurtful which served to significantly complicate the conversation and undermine trust
when such an incendiary comment is made in an asynchronous communication environment the neutral can see the comment prior to the other party viewing it and discuss it with the party who originally posted it in order to learn more about what the poster is aiming to achieve
for instance neutral may put an angrily worded post into comment which creates window of time in which the mediator might ask the poster how he or she feels this comment will be received by the other party and whether he or she feels it will help move the process toward mutually satisfactory solution
upon reflection the party may decide that redrafting the comment is advisable because it might have negative impact on the negotiation
this type of precommunication reframing is only colin rule in du sen journal of the international ombudsman association possible in an asynchronous interaction because in face to face interaction comment uttered by one party is heard by the other party as soon as the comment leaves the first lips
then the neutral is put into difficult situation where it is impossible to the bell that has just been by the provocative comment
in om buds work new capabilities make very useful option for om buds to use in dispute resolution processes
workplace environments have struggled with the challenge of resolving disputes for decades
part of this is because confronting conflict can be very unpleasant
for instance people in some cultures find it quite embarrassing to admit to having dispute and those in other cultures may find it difficult to have direct face to face communication with someone of different status
resolution processes that rely exclusively upon face to face communication can sometimes find themselves or ineffective in contexts like these
in the first example embarrassment if an ombudsperson approaches an individual in situation like this and asks that person about the existence of conflict the party will often deny it
the person may feel that experiencing conflict is shameful and an indication of selfishness or personal weakness
however even if the party refuses to acknowledge the existence of conflict it still may potentially worsen over time
online communication channels can sometimes provide way for the matter to be addressed without requiring an embarrassing face to face confrontation
the change of communication type afforded by online dispute resolution mechanisms can help the parties get bit of distance from the disagreement which can create space to brainstorm effective ways to resolve it
the parties engaged in the online communication may in fact act like nothing is going on in their face to face interactions but the online channel enables them to communicate openly and brainstorm solutions
one cannot assume that the optimal informal conflict resolution process is always direct face to face communication once one knows about cultural considerations and the different needs of those who contact an om buds office
asynchronous communication can be beneficial when an ombudsman is working within an organization populated by individuals who speak different languages and dialects
disputes possibly arising from cultural miscommunications or language difficulties may require process that supports and helps the ombudsman bridge the resulting communication challenges
face to face interaction particularly if the process is conducted in second or third language for one of the parties can be complicated by misunderstandings and inaccurate translations
text based asynchronous communication can enable the parties to be more reflective and thoughtful in the messages they exchange which can moderate the potential for further misunderstandings because they have an opportunity to review and edit their messages before sharing them with the other side
asynchronous communication can also enable the parties to do research in the midst of the negotiation potentially empowering them with important data that can help achieve more robust and fair resolution
it can also enable the parties to consult with other experts or supporters to ensure that they are fully informed of applicable rights and are equipped with accurate information instead of presumptions and guesses
asynchronous communication can also be prioritized against other obligations because it does not require immediate response to every message
in this way asynchronous interaction can help parties be at their best in resolution process which leads to better resolutions
online dispute resolution can also alter the access to information within their organization
online communication can be anonymous and anonymity can be powerful tool in getting people to be honest about their perspectives anonymity can drive trust in an environment colin rule in du sen journal of the international ombudsman association where there may be lack of perceived or actual safety in speaking up
in the face to face context anonymity is often infeasible if not impossible
for instance an om buds might create an online form to collect concerns and feedback anonymously enabling the ombudsperson to further research specific areas or provide supporting information for making recommendations gathered through these channels
as om buds practitioners understand well for situations where individuals may be afraid of retaliation or stigmatization an anonymous forum can give them way to share information that they want to share without fear
in many ways om buds serve as that forum but an online tool overseen by the om buds office can enhance this ability and be instrumental in allowing such information to surface
tools can also be used creatively in raising awareness about an om buds program and conducting outreach to constituents
om buds offices typically make outreach efforts to ensure that those who have access to the office know about the program the people involved in the program how the office can help how to contact the office etc
most om buds offices already use web sites to provide such information some also take advantage of online intake and calendaring tools
it is natural next step to extend these tools to make the information more accessible
in addition since many om buds offices also provide training and education there are opportunities to think about how can help support these efforts through online forums boards web in ar sessions virtual town halls etc
online dispute resolution can also be very helpful in the reporting upward context
ombudsman programs typically collect data to share picture of the types of issues received and feedback the organization should be aware of and many use case management system
tools can make the collection and management of data monitoring of issues and followup of reports transparent and thoroughly documented
it is plausible for an om buds office to have tool for an system that not only assists with the resolution process but also supports the larger case management system assists with the awareness and outreach efforts of the program and automatically generates reports including trend analyses and red flags sharing them with appropriate audiences
in this way tools can become partner for an om buds office and its staff they can even help improve coordination the sharing of updated information communication and discussions between ombudsmen in common office
down sides to technology in dispute resolution it must also be noted that integrating technology is not always good thing when it comes to dispute resolution processes
sometimes the lack of nonverbal communication can make engagement between the parties more complicated or perpetuate misconceptions and misunderstandings
in some disputes one party may be much more comfortable with technology than the other party as result the use of technology may perpetuate power imbalances
for example if one party is able to type much faster than the other party and the dispute is being resolved in an asynchronous text based chat type environment the faster typist may have significant advantage and may leverage that advantage by getting in two or three words for every word that the other party types
or if one party has powerful computer with fast internet connection and the other party is relying on an older computer with slow dialup connection it can also generate imbalances between the parties
equal access to the right tools for the process can affect actual or perceived fairness in process
of course it is important to remember that conflict can signal rupture in relationship and technology may not play role in helping to soothe and heal the harms caused by that rupture
the authors do colin rule in du sen journal of the international ombudsman association not advocate the integration of technology into every dispute resolution process
instead they urge ombudsmen to incorporate these tools and techniques into their toolbox of approaches so that the tools can be appropriately deployed in situations where they can add value to the but avoided in situations where they are likely to be distraction or further complicate matters
questions ombudsmen may have as they incorporate helpful tools ombudsmen may have several questions when incorporating technology into their practices
one of them focuses on confidentiality and record keeping
if for example an office adheres to the standards of practice and code of ethics an ombudsman does not keep records that contain identifying information on behalf of the organization see standard
however tools and services such as encryption deleting identifying records using independent third party services and other security measures may help address this question
an online tool does not necessarily create or keep identifying records but the om buds profession many need to consider this issue
many ombudsmen are already using tools such as company or external email systems sky pe doodle and survey monkey because they help them reach the right audience and have become indispensable in to those who have dispersed constituency
however confidentiality and security are issues that should be addressed because many of these tools are not confidential
some concerns are also due to the about how technology affects confidentiality which is reason for ombudsmen to become more familiar with tools
much of this also depends on the agreement between the om buds program and the organization and the level of independence program has around confidentiality
because an ombudsman is an informal resource would using online dispute resolution make the process more formal or less formal
we think that it does not if it is clearly for the purposes of informal dispute resolution
can be used to facilitate both formal and informal processes without changing their character
it supports the facilitator as and helps practitioner use methods of communication that are already familiar to their constituents when appropriate
ombudsmen likely have several questions about using technology in their practices but final question worth mentioning here is fear of incorporating something new and perhaps some self doubt about their abilities to pursue learn and use new technology in their practices
focusing on providing safe in person places for visitors is invaluable however om buds also need to find ways to reach those who may not be able to engage in in person sessions
therefore the question this begs of practitioners is how to build awareness and technology more broadly
technology cannot replace ombudsmen but it can enhance their ability to reach others
the authors encourage others to learn what would be only for their offices and their practices but also for themselves as practitioners who can be equipped with new set of skills
conclusion new technologies often stimulate skepticism about their acceptability and worry about what will be lost if that technology catches on
in the when banks were beginning to roll out automated teller machines at ms for their customers common argument against the at ms was that people wanted to have personal relationships with their bankers
the trust generated by shaking colin rule in du sen journal of the international ombudsman hand and looking into his or her eyes could never be established with faceless machine just distributing cash
think about your own experience though
when was the last time you went inside bank to withdraw money from your account
do you miss the experience of standing in line and speaking to teller in person
in modern times it is unusual for individuals to go inside bank branch to take care of simple tasks regarding their bank accounts but they will see teller if they need to deal with complex problems beyond the capabilities of machines
in the last few years at ms have become even more powerful and flexible taking stacks of checks all at once scanning and reading them and rarely making mistakes
bank customers now trust the machines and in many cases prefer them to people for simple interactions
the tellers instead focus on the exceptional tasks that require deliberation and advice
banks have transferred administrative tasks to the at ms who are kind of like the of banking
these changes are good for consumers and good for the banks
similar change is coming to the practice of dispute resolution
om buds play an indispensable role in connecting and supporting people in their organizations and the heart of that will always be face to face interaction
but technology is getting better at handling the administrative burdens of conflict resolution
visitors to an om buds office increasingly expect to be able to raise concern or make complaint at any hour of the day or night because they recognize the software is always there continuously available in way that humans simply cannot be
as it improves software will help ombudsmen provide relevant information to parties improve responsiveness expand transparency and accessibility and provide continuous process improvement
it will also enable us to focus our efforts on the cases that most require human touch instead of spreading ourselves thinly over many cases that demand equal measures of our attention
it will help ombudsmen reach more people and help more people reach the services of an ombudsman
the increased sophistication of our technology tools will continue to transform the role of the ombudsperson especially as the expectations of our parties change along with wider transformation
ombudsmen should continuously educate themselves about newly available technology tools so their practices can evolve with the times
if done right this expansion of technology will help to make us more effective in our organizations and keep us matter what new technologies emerge in the future and what role they play in creating or resolving workplace conflicts

ombudsman mediation conflict resolution frames narrative kathleen moore the art of om buds ing using multiple frames to resolve conflict
organizational ombudsmen provide impartial independent and confidential dispute resolution to employees within organizations and rely on several well established alternative dispute resolution processes to assist parties in reaching solutions
these include individual coaching in which an employee brings concern and privately discusses options for handling the matter on his her own shuttle diplomacy in which the ombudsman goes back and forth between parties with information and negotiable options without bringing the parties together and facilitation and mediation in which ombudsmen bring together all involved parties to arrive at solutions that are mutually agreeable
the process of generating options from which to proceed is fundamental to most processes
it is important to note that differences exist in whether the ombudsman believes it is his her responsibility to propose options or whether the options should come solely from the parties
although few researchers have explored the process of generating options the assumption is that the ombudsman assists the parties in identifying alternative positions interests or behaviors as byproduct of either elicit ive questioning or discussions with the parties regarding desired outcomes in the matter
one might ask how does an ombudsman assist parties in conceptualizing journal of the international ombudsman association kathleen moore problems imagining solutions and developing variety of ways of seeing the problem
how in fact does an ombudsman propose options that are appropriate
is there guiding principle or step by step process in which certain types of options are considered first
this paper explores how specific model from corporate management and leadership literature may provide useful framework in explaining this process and answering these important questions
the model arises from the bestselling text from lee bol man and terrence deal entitled modern approaches to understanding and managing organizations
first published in and now in its th edition the book is classic in the management and leadership field
this model offers different lenses through which to frame and reframe issues and conflicts suggesting structure and order that can organize clues about motives of the parties
it provides way to introduce relevant external factors that give the ombudsman path through the dead ends and murky alleyways of conflict to superhighway where the ombudsman and parties can together more readily develop options that may bring the situation to satisfying end result
ombudsmen do not work solely on instinct but also with more tangible coinage
to fully appreciate the blending of intuition practical theory and techniques it is necessary to first review the stages of conflict resolution and especially the general process of framing and generating options which an organizational ombudsman employs
second this paper will review the bol man and deal organizational model to familiarize the reader with the concepts contained therein
finally readers will explore case study that illustrates how the bol man and deal model may prove useful overarching framework for the organizational ombudsman to situate her practice of problem setting and generating options
several general stages characterize an problem solving intervention
first the party or parties contact the ombudsman and arrange confidential meeting
if the interaction establishes clear expectations for building baseline trust and comfort the party presents an initial characterization of the situation
the ombudsman outlines the guiding principles of her role and sets general expectations of how she might be useful in resolving problems
thus the ombudsman and parties establish an initial implicit agreement about the scope of the work they will pursue together
as the party begins to tell his story the ombudsman takes note of variety of information and cues including psychological substantive and procedural information
moore describes the utility of spotlight ing the role of psychological conditions that affect the parties in conflict
moore recommends that mediators expanded by this author to include ombudsmen who are mediating consider the psychological readiness of the parties in addition to their substantive concerns such as the remedies they desire or the procedural preferences for achieving their substantive resolution
moore also considers substantive interests which are often central needs on which negotiations focus including particular goods such as money and time
procedural interests refer to the preferences that mediator has for the way that the parties discuss their differences and the manner in which the bargaining outcome is implemented
possible procedural interests might be that each person has the opportunity to speak his or her mind that negotiations occur in an orderly and timely leading to written document or contract if it should result from the process
he should then design appropriate procedures to reduce potential negative impacts and enhance positive ones
journal of the international ombudsman association kathleen moore the ombudsman begins to ask herself the following questions what seems to have been the most injurious event that harmed the party what seems to matter most to the party about that event what is the history of the relationship between the parties currently what sort of relationship is anticipated in the future and what remedy is the party seeking
ideally several results emerge from the initial and ongoing engagement with the ombudsman
these results include general understanding of the situation the range of potentially satisfactory solutions and an assessment of the likelihood of productive problem solving relationship between the parties
critical aspect for success in any stage of the intervention is the establishment of working relationship that is devoted to building mechanisms for trust and cooperation for solving the conflict at hand
the ombudsman can also help parties find creative options for resolution through self reflection leading and guiding them to reflect on their needs worries and hopes in trusting and non evaluative space
this reflection fosters more effective reality testing of the own feelings and attitudes as well as reality testing cues from the environment
ability to accurately read and respond to stimuli from outside can help him move away from thinking in preconceived categories
carl rogers the renowned psychotherapist and master of communication states that this person is able to take in the evidence in new situation as it is rather than distorting it to fit pattern which he already
this increasing ability to be open to experience makes him far more realistic in dealing with new people new situations new problems and older familiar ones as well
it means his beliefs are not rigid that he can tolerate ambiguity
as trust develops an interaction begins in which the ombudsman and the party together develop potential options for viewing the context or the situation evaluating the options that seem possible and discarding some and finally shifting into tentative adoption of strategy to implement action or perhaps even and see which is sometimes appropriate
ack off describes this process as desirable future and inventing ways of bringing it
as parties and the ombudsman share information and the working relationship gels the ombudsman develops working formulation of the problem that she tentatively shares with the parties for inspection and analysis
we can define this preliminary casting as framing
donald sch on although not writing specifically about ombudsmen in the reflective practitioner suggested framing happens through process he calls
he said in real world practice problems do not present themselves to the practitioner as givens
they must be constructed from the materials of problematic situations which are puzzling troubling and uncertain
in order to convert problematic situation to problem practitioner must do certain kind of work
he must make sense of an uncertain
when he sets the problem he selects what he will treat as the of the situation he sets the boundaries of his attention to it and he imposes upon it coherence which allows him to say what is wrong and in what directions the situation needs to be changed
problem setting is process in which interactively he names the things to which he will attend and frames the context in which he will attend to
it is through the nontechnical process of framing the problematic situation that we may organize and clarify both the ends to be achieved and the possible means of achieving them
journal of the international ombudsman association kathleen moore sch on explained that the specialized practitioner in the course of his practice many variations on relatively small number of cases presented over and over in which he develops repertoire of expectations images and techniques
he learns what to look for and how to respond to what he
one can also apply model of reflective practice to describe the orientation to problem solving within the organization
as an experienced problem solver for the organization in which she works the ombudsman has developed an understanding not only of the general types and peculiarities of conflicts that often percolate and arise there but she also has had experience and developed repertoire of remedies that are likely to satisfy both organizational and individual interests in that culture
and according to sch on are the interpretive schemes that mediators use to make sense of and organize their activities while at work on
ko lb described this activity in the following way what mediator or ombudsman who is mediating or coaching or providing organizational consultation does in case is blend of intentional and explicit technique the tacit and taken for granted ways each has developed of dealing with the typical cases in practice and more general beliefs about the causes of conflict and the possibilities for its resolution
we see frames as way to capture some of the implicit but nonetheless powerful orientations mediators have toward their role
this focus on frames derives from our observation that mediators are rarely passive actors in the process
rather they actively orchestrate the ways the dispute will be handled and let the parties know in no uncertain terms what is expected of them
frames give focus to the myriad of choices mediators make while at work in dispute and suggest as well what comes to be seen as problematic and difficult
although she often follows the reflection and framing process described above the ombudsman does not simply impose her formulations or reframing on the party
instead there is highly interactive process in which the ombudsman uses elicit ive questions to discover the psychological and substantive interests in order to drive the reflective process
the transactional nature of the process allows the ombudsman to remain open to the discovery of deepened understanding of the party as well as the discovery of new twists and turns regarding the problem
this verbal inquiry turns into the preliminary reframing of the situation but remains open to the feedback thoughts beliefs and emotional tone which serve to refine the framing dialogue
mayer stated that the evolution of an enduring conflict can be tracked by the various ways the conflict has been framed over time
struggles over framing are often central to the way conflict is enacted
each framing both reflects the nature of the conflict and promotes particular set of interests and approaches to engagement
one of the most profound impacts of agreements in enduring conflict is their potential for developing promoting and solidifying new framing of conflict
to the extent that these new narrative frames are rooted in the fundamental needs of the disputants and the structure of the conflict they can have permanent impact on how people engage in conflict
in summary we see how the ombudsman begins her work by establishing trustworthy contact with the party developing an information gathering dialogue to understand the history and interests of the party with an eye towards the psychological substantive and procedural needs em journal of the international ombudsman association kathleen moore bedded in the situation deepening relationship with the person as she listens closely offering feedback so that the two interact to de construct the interwoven elements of the presenting problem creating framework of the problem for the party assessing the reframing jointly with the party and reaching consensus regarding tentative strategies possible for resolution and shifting to agreement on which option to implement
in any event the options must satisfy the substantive procedural and psychological interests of the parties if they are to be considered as acceptable solutions to the moore
bol man and deal suggest four perspectives through which to understand organizations as well as reframe organizational problems
the four categories or lenses are as follows structural human resource political and symbolic
although there are both weaknesses and strengths in viewing issues and organizations through any of the lenses the authors described the selective applicability of each showed how they can help individuals understand what is happening within organizations and demonstrated how they can illuminate different approaches to deal with difficult situations within organizations
bol man and book is written for an audience of managers and leaders but the framework is useful for anyone in an organization who may have to engage in problem solving when issues arise
they believe that understanding organizations is nearly impossible when the manager is unconsciously wed to single narrow perspective
most organizations are managers in all organizations large or small public or private can increase their effectiveness and their freedom through the use of multiple vantage points
they believe that managers who understand their own default frame and who can adeptly rely on more than one limited perspective are better equipped to understand and manage the complex everyday world of organizations
sometimes they can make significant difference in how that world responds
bol man deal the four frames described are based on the four major schools of organizational research and theory
for each frame bol man and deal provided label and consolidated the central assumptions and propositions
journal of the international ombudsman association kathleen moore table emphasis problems arise when preferred solutions structural formal roles policies and coordination processes
existing structure does not fit the needs of the organization
identification of the mismatch possible reorganization
human resource individual skills needs and attitudes
human needs to belong and contribute skills are thwarted
tailor organization to enable people to feel good about their contributions
political changing coalitions around interests that change as issues come and go
power is so unevenly distributed that it is difficult to accomplish goals feel secure
develop solutions through political skill and complex conflict resolution
symbolic unlike others this abandons assumptions of rationality
organizations are bound by histories rituals and myths more than by rules
individuals are not aware of their symbolic roles and do not em body the symbols and rituals in meaningful ways
develop improvements through clarity of symbols and myths that link to productivity
the structural frame emphasizes the importance of formal roles and relationships
structures commonly depicted in organization charts are created to fit an environment and technology
organizations allocate responsibilities to participants of and create rules policies and management hierarchies to coordinate diverse activities
problems arise when the structure does not fit the situation
at that point some form of reorganization is needed to remedy the mismatch
the human resource frame bol man and term the author would suggest an alternative that more effectively captures the humanistic element of the framework establishes its territory because organizations are inhabited by people
individuals have needs feelings and prejudices
they have both skills and limitations
they have great capacity to learn and sometimes even greater tendency to defend old attitudes and beliefs
from human resource perspective the key to effectiveness is to tailor organizations to people to find an organizational form that will enable people to get the job done while feeling good about what they are doing
problems arise when human needs such as the need for achievement to belong and to practice skills are throttled
the political frame views organizations as arenas of scarce resources where power and influence are constantly affecting the allocation of resources among individuals or groups
conflict is expected because of differences in needs perspectives and lifestyles among individuals and groups
bargaining coercion and compromise are all part of everyday organizational life
coalitions form around specific interests and may change as issues come and go
problems may arise because power is unevenly distributed or is so broadly dispersed that it is difficult to get anything done
solutions are developed through political skill and acumen much as machiavel li suggested centuries ago
the symbolic frame abandons the assumptions of rationality that appear in each of the other frames and treats the organization as theater or carnival
organizations are viewed as held together more by shared values and culture than by goals and policies
are propelled more by rituals ceremonies stories heroes and myths than by rules policies and managerial problems arise when actors play their parts badly when symbols lose their meaning when ceremonies and rituals lose their potency
improvements come through symbol myth and bol man deal
journal of the international ombudsman association kathleen moore keeping these four frames in mind let us turn our attention to an example of conflict that might appear in the office of the ombudsman and analyze options according to the assumptions found from each frame
the following scenario is fictional but is representative of casework in an organization comprised of individuals engaged in scientific research
there are three parties involved the principal investigator pi of prominent laboratory in pharmaceutical research facility and two postdoctoral fellows post docs from european countries who have been recruited and brought to the organization to provide expertise in particular area of brain imaging and surgery
one is an in format ic ian mathematician with expertise in creating innovative computer scans and the other is physician with and clinical skills in surgery
the pi contacted the ombudsman for assistance in managing dispute between these two researchers
the pi expected the two to collaborate on research and clinical applications of particular brain imaging technology as applied to surgical techniques
the pi stated that the post docs had not been getting along for some time and had ceased essential communication thus stalemating the exchange of scientific information
the pi admitted that he had tried to out of hoping the two would eventually work out their differences and the expected scientific collaboration would find productive track
however recent incident occurred in which the two exchanged angry words and the physician shoved the mathematician jamming her arm into revolving door
this occurred in front of other members of the lab disrupting the work of the lab and creating division of loyalties among the staff
the mathematician post doc who was shoved has threatened to bring charges against the physician and demanded the early termination of his appointment due to what she felt was violation of workplace respect and what constituted workplace violence
the pi explained that he spoke to both separately and told them he would like them to work with the ombudsman to mediate the dispute
both reluctantly agreed possibly to mitigate disciplinary proceedings
the ombudsman at this point entered in an information gathering discussion with the pi
the discussion ascertained the involvement in the development of the collaboration how he recruited and selected the two post docs and his scientific and personal impressions of their work and maturation as scientific colleagues
the ombudsman needs to know how active and direct he has been regarding his expectations of the post docs in the collaboration
he may or may not have been specific about his expectations with respect to authorship of papers from the work allocation of scientific resources boundaries of their personal scientific input with respect to each other and him and expectations of guidance and mentor ing from him for the duration of the two year project
it was important to understand how involved the pi was willing to be in managing the conflict and how he saw his role in influencing the social and professional culture of the lab and the caliber of communications and relationships that develop there
it was during this conversation of inquiry that cooperative spirit began to build between the pi and the ombudsman regarding the manner in which this situation could be resolved
this preliminary dialogue gave the ombudsman beginning sense of context of the issues important to the pi as she prepared to meet with the post docs
for the purposes of brevity we will assume that the ombudsman met with each of the post docs
the ombudsman can meet with the post docs either separately journal of the international ombudsman association kathleen moore or together
there are advantages and disadvantages to each option and it is largely matter of practice preference that dictates the choice
the ombudsman engaged them in exploratory conversations as described in the sections above and generated working hypothesis regarding how to reframe the problem to each of them
at this point in the process we now shift to an exploration of the bol man and deal model and its application in reframing the problematic situation between the post docs
defining the issues the first perspective the ombudsman may take is that the issues might fit loosely in the structural frame
there appears to be problem of coordination and communication ill defined roles vague goals and no consistent processes for communication between the pi and the two post docs
conversations with the pi and the two post docs revealed that there was no clear understanding about how they would collaborate on day today basis
when the two arrived in the lab they were left to themselves to define the processes by which they would exchange information obtain guidance from the pi and proceed with the scientific research including publishing and authorship expectations
there was no agreement on the type or duration of guidance the pi would provide or how to establish the goals of the scientific work itself
both post docs felt that the lack of structure lack of definition of roles and vague goals contributed to their frustration during their transition to the american lab
options for resolution structural solution might include suggesting the three discuss the kinds of regular meetings or structures that would assist them in defining concrete scientific goals clarifying each role and responsibilities in meeting those goals and identifying agreed upon processes for communication of scientific content as well as personal checking in by the pi to see how the two post docs were adjusting to the american lab and bureaucratic issues that they felt impeded their work
defining the issues using this frame the ombudsman could suggest that the issues emanate from misunderstandings of the working style of each poor interpersonal skills and differences in personal temperament and culture that affect each communication skills
in the discussions with the post docs they identified that they were by the way the other interacted
for example the female mathematician post doc preferred to do her work alone and felt resentful when other colleagues interrupted her work with questions or even invitations to lunch or breaks
for her this was disruption of her internal creative process
she also felt uncomfortable with the others in the lab whom she did not know well and she preferred to work independently and with little guidance or input from others
the physician post doc man enjoyed giving advice to others who had questions and welcomed interruptions and conversation
the physician saw the mathematician as nerd ish and
the mathematician saw the physician as giving more attention to relationships within the lab than to the work itself
furthermore she did not respect his more casual working style
thus the two had divergent styles of working that immediately impeded the willingness to communicate and on personal level they seem to like each other
finally english was the second language for the mathematician and the third language for the physician
the added step of fine tuning english to share information made the situation far worse
journal of the international ombudsman association kathleen moore another factor contributed to the mismatch between individual needs and organizational ones
because the mathematician arrived in the lab first she was given the responsibility for coordination and drafting of the lab protocol which would drive the collaboration
she was not suited nor interested in the coordination aspects that would require her to meet with other lab members and work in more collaborative style not aligned to her comfort level
although she was given the lead on the drafting of the protocol it was not clearly understood who would be first or second author on papers that would no doubt result from this work
the issue of authorship had never been discussed openly but was item one on the hidden agenda of both parties
options for resolution using the human resource frame possible remedy might be to engage the post docs in discussion about how to legitimize and more effectively deploy their different working styles
perhaps the physician would enjoy managing the protocol duties relieving the mathematician of task she did not enjoy
the ombudsman might hypothesize that the pi whom both post docs respected enormously might play valuable role here in several regards
the pi could make explicit his policy and expectation of the authorship question reaffirm his confidence and trust in both of their unique qualities and talents and consider assigning roles and responsibilities suited to their different skills and interests
this represents structural solution to human resource mismatch
defining the issues this view suggests that power and influence constantly affect allocation of resources among individuals and that bargaining coercion and compromise are to be expected in everyday life
it is also important to keep in mind that when power is perceived to be unfairly acquired or wielded it is natural for individuals in such situation to guard against potential psychological substantive or procedural loss dynamic that can rock the boat in unintended ways
this can be conceptualized as natural protective measure
in this lab power was so broadly dispersed and ill defined that it was difficult to get anything done
when the post docs needed equipment instruments or other materials they had to personally approach the procurement officer to order the items
this proved daunting and bureaucratic tangle that felt far from efficient and delayed experiments
the mathematician not wanting to address the procurement clerk whom she felt was uncooperative and not wanting to burden her pi with the difficulty began to either do without things she needed or borrow software from colleagues in her home lab
this became problematic in several ways it limited her effectiveness in communicating with the procurement officer and her pi and because the physician post doc would often hear her talking on the phone in her native language he assumed the conversation was not in english in order to exclude him
this assumption contributed to their spiraling distancing and distrust of each other because it created and fostered distance between two people who may have otherwise supported one another in dealing with shared problem the procurement process and possibly devised concrete ideas to remedy the situation
the unfortunate assumption further fractured the cohesive team building possibilities that might have been nurtured in the lab
as it turned out the physician had managed to effectively learn the bureaucratic system cooperate with the procurement officer and continue to place orders for things he needed
this engendered resentment and envy from the mathematician who was not as assertive and did not effectively navigate the procurement system
using the political framework the mathematician had in turn assumed that the physician was positioning himself among the americans in hopes to remain in the country at the end of his fellowship
the physician worried that the mathematician was loyal only to journal of the international ombudsman association kathleen moore her colleagues at home and might share data or information with them without sharing it with himself and the others in the us lab
in any event neither had an accurate understanding of what the other had in mind for the duration of the collaboration larger career goals or expectations from the other in achieving them
they were operating from different frames about their roles their communications how power should and was wielded in the lab and the ultimate personal and professional meanings of this period in their careers
options for resolution it proved useful to ask how each post doc managed their administrative duties as well as to discuss their perceptions regarding responsibility for coordinating and drafting the lab protocol that was intended to serve as the fundamental guidance for the collaboration
the mathematician expressed her discomfort with the role of coordinating the protocol and also appeared uncomfortable working jointly with other members of the lab with respect to administrative tasks
the physician on the other hand expressed comfort and ease with both aspects of interaction and responsibility
it seemed possible that the two might consider switching roles allowing the physician to assist with the lab protocol and administration which he might enjoy and which might serve as relief for the mathematician
defining the issues the two post docs held very different views of the context of their collaboration
the mathematician left her home under tremendous political and familial pressure
she was the first student from her university and the first child in her family to have the opportunity to study and work in america
she felt the weight of the burden of her academic community and of her expectations crushing her
she was charged with representing her academic specialty that of informatics mathematics in biomedical collaboration that held tremendous meaning for her
personally and professionally the stakes were high
she felt intense pressure to publish in established american journals her future professional status largely depended on the recognition she brought from this american collaboration
to her successfully publishing in an american journal symbolized not solely personal and professional achievement but national pride and familial standing in the community at home
she singlemindedly focused on this goal rather than reflecting on how she would integrate with the lab colleagues or develop lasting professional relationships
in contrast the physician had previously studied abroad and felt little performance anxiety
he was primarily engaged in the collaboration to learn and expand his surgical expertise so that he could stay in america and start private clinical practice
options for resolution the fact that the two cared about different symbols and power dynamics is not automatically problem
instead pointing out the multiple realities legitimizing each and perhaps developing joint symbol for their work together could soften their hardened opinions about each motivations
ironically not only did the two hold disparate symbolic views of what constituted success individually they also shared mythic expectation that their professional and personal identities could best be fostered in the united states
for both the united states symbolized freedom to study and to excel in ways not possible at home
an unrealistic symbolic expectation or myth about what can be achieved can present its own thorny perceptions so there could be value in attempting to discuss what might constitute joint symbol to envision and conduct their collaboration
in this section we will explore this case in more depth including the perspectives of others involved and how their frames affected the conflict
we will see how the different frames that the parties had shaped the ways they talked to one another and to the ombudsman
it is clear that the frames were not solely of use to the ombudsman the parties themselves are operating from and reacting based on different frames
we introduce the next question trifecta for practice consideration
in what way does the frame choice affect the paths for resolution
how does an ombudsman choose frame
what happens when parties have different frames from one another
it is easy to imagine the limits of reframing and generating options if one operates from only one frame
for example in the scenario above if the ombudsman had utilized only structural frame she would have set the problem in only those terms and attended to resolving it through the reframing of the lack of structure ill defined roles and vague goals
satisfactory result may have included newly defined goals specific role identification and mechanism to meet regularly for critical assessment of the progress of the project
however this path would leave unaddressed issues of working style the political interpretations of the intentions and the wide chasm between each symbolic assumptions
although this weakness might not threaten the satisfactory structural solution it would not allow the parties an opportunity to recognize and address important aspects of the conflict that would not only widen their self awareness but perhaps also strengthen the synergy of the scientific collaboration and pursuit of individual interests
in this situation the ombudsman chose structural frame intertwined with elements from the human resource frame dancing back and forth between issues related to power as outlined in the political frame
she arrived at this arrangement only after talking with shadow but crucial parties to the situation the pi and the lab manager
both provided key and new information about the impact of the conflict on the entire lab
this new information also expanded the framing possibilities by highlighting the different frames of those involved
the pi approached the situation as one that required disciplinary response and he thought the dispute was about cultural difference or personal dislike
he ultimately admitted he was not really sure of these issues as he was absent much of the time
his stated goal was to shepherd the professional relationship back to productive level so that the scientific work could continue
the pi was only secondarily concerned with improving the understanding or relationship between the two scientists
he recommended that the ombudsman speak with the lab manager to gain broader context of the personal and professional dynamics
the ombudsman met with the lab manager who indeed provided new information about the professional styles and personalities of each scientist and their incompatibilities
she believed dispute involving authorship of paper that involved the husband who had worked in the lab several years prior provided the underpinning for the deterioration of the relationship
she further believed the dispute was failure of well defined establishment of authorship process in the department rather than straightforward difference in personalities and work styles
journal of the international ombudsman association kathleen moore the ombudsman next met individually with each of the post docs
during these meetings each told their story and defended their position with respect to the shoving incident which was the stated problem
the mathematician was keenly aware of how the dynamics between the two might impact others in the lab
she felt that the situation was such severe violation of scientific integrity that she should look for another position in order to restore order to the lab
this perspective constituted blend of the human resource and symbolic frames perhaps reflection of either her perceptions of power or her perceived lack of power
the physician on the other hand professed that the situation affected no one else in the lab and that sometimes got out of
he felt that his statement to the mathematician be watching was not real threat and that the other post doc should understand that people often say things in the heat of the moment that they do not really mean
he added that the mathematician told him send you straight to the hell which showed that they both acted in an unprofessional manner and that she had provoked him
he claimed not to be too bothered by the comment and distanced himself from the fact that he shoved the other post doc calling it an
his strategy was to and get on with the science and basically ignore the mathematician
he happened to mention in passing he had some concerns about how authorship was established in the lab
when the ombudsman met with the two scientists together they each took position on either side of the table forming triangle and avoiding each other
as each told the story of what had happened they debated their positions back and forth regarding who was responsible for shoving for sending whom to the hell etc
the ombudsman intentionally waited to see whether either party would surface the issue of authorship that had been mentioned by the lab manager and physician
when neither party mentioned the authorship issue and the debate about who should be disciplined and how continued unabated the ombudsman wondered aloud whether the triggering event in their relationship was actually authorship of the paper
this was the first conscious framing of the conflict
it captured an idea that had not been identified or vocalized by the parties or the pi
both post docs reacted with surprise and readily agreed
the ombudsman then was able to ask questions to elicit ways in which things could have gone very differently during the authorship process
the questions introduced other potential frames with which to view the situation
for example the ombudsman asked the physician whether it would have changed his perspective about the role in the authorship process if he knew that the pi had approved the authorship order but had neglected to share that information with him
the ombudsman had learned this information from caucus with the mathematician
the physician said it might have that it was easier to blame the other post doc based on their rocky communication history rather than on any unhappiness with the pi whom he was still trying to impress since he was so new in the lab
this line of thought represented shift in reframing into the symbolic aspects of what it means to belong in the lab and how power is wielded in making decisions whose work is considered valuable with whom the pi communicates most frequently etc
the ombudsman shifted to testing the human resource frame when the post docs reverted into an argument about who was to blame for the shoving incident
the ombudsman asked the physician journal of the international ombudsman association kathleen moore first privately in caucus whether it was acceptable to communicate that he admitted he should have said or apologized when he was moving the equipment that ran into the other post doc
he agreed to have the ombudsman share that information
afterwards both post docs sat very quietly
after few minutes the ombudsman broke the silence by asking the mathematician whether it made difference to learn that the physician believed he should have handled things differently and apologized
she agreed that it did make difference
another long silence resulted in which neither party spoke word or indeed looked up from the table
the ombudsman also sat quietly for few minutes to allow them to process what had been said
the ombudsman was uncomfortable but did not want to direct the interaction at this critical point
finally the ombudsman raised the possibility of different perspective different frame as it were one of personal apology and the possibility of acceptance and forgiveness the human resource frame
this notion appeared to stop the action between them
the tension seemed to drain away
the moment seemed comfortable at this point so the ombudsman ventured yet another frame
she asked if they wanted to talk few minutes about how they might introduce and use tact in their daily life in the lab to smooth the relationship to devote time to develop the criteria for setting up boundaries and systems to resume work in the laboratory structural frame or engage in both discussions
they both agreed to focus on how to resume productive work in the laboratory that incorporated ways to share space and exchange specimens when needed preferring to focus on the structural aspects of the situation
they spelled out in detail ways in which they would like to separate their areas of scientific focus allowing them some professional space from each other and to foster personal autonomy
as part of set of recommendations to their pi they agreed to inform him that they wished to switch roles of administration and lab protocol development as mentioned above so that the physician would assume primary responsibility for development of the lab protocol and coordinate administrative processes within the lab
they also agreed that establishing processes for regular dialogue with all members of the lab would allow everyone the opportunity to discuss emergent administrative and scientific issues
they agreed that the lab sorely needed written communication from the pi about his expectations regarding authorship processes
they ended with solutions intersecting the structural and human resource frames with increased shared power dynamic in the political frame
this case also provides an opportunity to highlight mediation techniques that involve the ombudsman mindfully using information to support the parties and foster resolution
in addition to introducing different frames to help the parties think about their perspective differently this technique illustrates an important aspect of conflict resolution practice
the ombudsman was able to assist the parties in calling forth needed adaptive roles to the through the use of tact and information control
she consciously over communicated some facts and under communicated others
she intentionally imparted versions of the other party so that closer relationship between the two might look possible to each of them by conveying reformulations or refr am in gs of what had gone wrong in the past
she presented entrusted information from private meetings by seeking permission and by voicing tentative overtures to maximize the timing of the new information so that the injured party might accept the information in its most positive translation
one of the most provocative moves an ombudsman can make is to ask questions from another frame to help parties reflect on the existence and legitimacy of different perspectives
this technique expands awareness for the parties and through raising other frames fosters habit of impartiality in the ombudsman
ombudsmen can consider different frames in order to keep check on their own impartiality
an additional advantage may be that for both the parties to conflict and the ombudsman utilizing different frames allows for shifts in focus without presumption that one frame is or
this orientation can stimulate an expectation and ethos that there is value in simply observing differences in approaches without judgment of which is better or worse
this fictional scenario illustrates how the bol man and deal conceptual model of organizational theory can provide framework for framing and generating options for the organizational ombudsman and parties to conflict
each recasting suggests questions to ask and additional options to consider
not every situation will require the same depth of attention to each
but deliberate reframing of disputes from these vantage points may open up additional avenues for the ombudsman in forming hypotheses imagining solutions generating options from these frames and facilitating the dialogue between all parties towards reaching tentative strategies that meet the psychological procedural and substantive interests of the parties

the primary purpose of human resources departments is to serve and protect the institution not the individual employee
in many institutions human resources also has role in employee relations labor relations and answering questions about policies and practices
the extent to which human resources offices provide support to staff varies widely
what is less variable is the fact that human resources personnel are often hired to directly serve those in power
given that bullies are typically people with some sort of positional power human resources staff may not be in the best position to approach those with power regarding allegations of bullying
therefore in matters involving bullying by people with positional power human resources staff members are in the precarious position as who cannot in fact enforce
rather they advise and coach executive staff to adopt more agreeable behaviors
problems can arise when the executive finds that these recommendations contradict their preferred style of wielding authority
this circular problem can render the human resources person largely powerless to address complaints of bullying by those with power

this does not address the actual problem of bullying
respondent given the economic status of the country firmly believe that bullying will continue
people are tolerating more because higher education is becoming more businesslike
people are often reminded that they are lucky to have
this is very unfortunate and human resources is doing nothing to strategize to change the perception
respondent have held four jobs in fundraising for higher education and at three of the organizations the toxic atmosphere was beyond oppressive and people were afraid to say anything
human resources offices have usually protected the bullies because they were senior staff and the person being bullied was let go or left in frustration
know lot of people who have felt very let down by human resources offices and it would be helpful to have human resources offer greater assistance and support
it gives you the confidence to not suffer in silence

holl is wagner offered interventions that om buds can employ in variety of difficult scenarios with compelling applications to workplace bullying
the om buds can silently influence policy
according to wagner om buds can offer insight into discussions on fair labor practice
though om buds are never present for the resolution of formal pending cases the om buds can contribute to later discussions on policy to suggest phrases to guard against repeat of the same unfair labor practice
aggregated anonymous om buds case data can project objective evidence highlighting trends of bullying and incivility
such data can inform leadership about emerging problems and give an early warning before they mushroom into more egregious problems
the om buds can highlight bias unfairness and unresponsiveness in organizational policies and procedures
while hr many be perceived as existing to protect the organization om buds can objectively evaluate the application of policies with an eye towards fairness to all
when the om buds sees trends emerging in problematic policy application or institutional apathy the om buds can bring such inequities forward to policy makers
the om buds operates from basis of impartiality and as such can draw attention to problematic and toxic behaviors in the organization including bullying without taking sides
the om buds can benefit an organization and its employees by serving as safe environment to raise and address concerns
similar to the canary in the mine that saved lives in toxic mine shafts om buds can also sound an early alert that preserves careers and avoids organizational costs
unlike human resources personnel in many institutions that serve the leadership and potentially the power structure that exhibits bullying behavior the om buds can operate as catalyst for change by making recommendations that foster healthier work environments

ombudsman internationalism internal self regulation accountability mary ro we
in our world of organizational mary ro we is the mother of us all
professionally we are all her children
mary retired in from the massachusetts institute of technology mit where she was an ombudsman for years
she has literally created parts of our operational vocabulary such as and and ensured the currency of the term
she has modelled creative and functional ombudsman interaction through her voluminous writings and her video trainings
she was the first instructor for the international ombudsman training courses and has been mentor to untold hundreds of us for the past four decades
mary has developed innovations in how we reflect upon our profession
for example she spearheaded the crystal ball presentations given for years at the annual conferences and the compensation and practice surveys for organizational ombudsmen
she has nurtured rigorous and determined operational philosophical and procedural questing and questioning not least through her pioneering editorial board work for the journal of the international ombudsman association
mary embodies the modelling of inclusiveness in all aspects of our work in addition to her seemingly tireless and extraordinarily effective advocacy for organizational ombudsmen globally
to assess the nature of mary insinuation into our professional collective consciousness commend the profile of her that longtime university of colorado ombudsman tom wrote for the journal of the international ombudsman series
in april of was honoured to deliver the first annual mary ro we keynote presentation at the annual conference in atlanta georgia
the conference organ is ers stipulated that the paper
critiques an area in the ombudsman profession or practice that warrants exploration
reflects at least one contribution from mary examining an emerging issue or topic andor research in organizational ombudsman practice and
reflects the significant contributions mary has provided the organizational ombudsman profession and associations throughout her career
accordingly focused my remarks on two broad issues that reflect on the practice of ombudsmen and on the profession as it is presently administered
the importance of establishing new standard of internal self regulation
the following article represents the talk delivered in atlanta with slight modifications for publication
it is my privilege to offer paper that honours mary ro we
journal of the international ombudsman association david milleri am so proud to be an organizational ombudsman to be part of this profession
although some of what discuss in the following remarks may appear critical want to assure all readers and colleagues of my deep respect and appreciation for all those who have served as officeholders and volunteers for the and predecessor organizations the ombudsman association toa and university and college om buds association and of my full support for the extraordinary quality and professionalism their work has generated
this explains part of my pride in this profession
at the same time cherish the idea that we must uphold the obligation to dissent
in what follows trust you will allow both the support and the obligation as propose some thoughts your hilarious or indignant as mary ro we herself would often say
story like to remember in the context of ombudsman toil concerns the great orchestral conductor herbert von ka raj an
after reportedly difficult rehearsal he is said to have stormed down to his waiting car and then flopped into the back seat saying just drive
von ka raj an replied need me everywhere
the has been going for more than years and we now have truly global association
at recent conference convened in bangkok under the auspices of the asia pacific regional advisory committee of the international committee fourteen of us gathered
we started collecting information about where asia pacific regional colleagues are actively far the list includes the following countries afghanistan armenia australia az er bai jan bangladesh bhutan da russ al am cambodia china cook islands fiji hong kong georgia guam india indonesia iraq israel japan jordan kazak hs tan kiri ba ti south korea republic lao lebanon macao malaysia mal dives marshall islands micronesia mongolia my an mar na uru nepal new zealand pakistan palau papua new guinea philippines russia samoa saudi arabia solomon islands singapore sri lan ka taiwan tajiki stan thailand timor leste tonga turkmen ist an turkey tu va lu united arab emirates uzbek ist an and vietnam
the reach of the few ombudsmen in the asia pacific region is out of all proportion to the numbers working there
the metric used by the to determine that reach and the reach of other ra cs should believe reflect the breadth of this influence not just the relatively small numbers providing it
the time is appropriate in my view for the to more actively work to ensure it is taking meaningful lessons back from this regional industry and the ombudsman practitioners implementing it from beyond north america
for believe we have to ask some important questions of ourselves as an association of professionals about how we relate professionally to the regions
for what added value does the and its annual conference bring to parts of the world outside north america
one esteemed colleague in bangkok asked us all would go to the annual conference when it reflects mainly the concerns of the united states
what relevance does that have for me
colleagues also discussed the need for support and nurturing of their practice in the region as that we get through enabling regional meetings
journal of the international ombudsman association david how can we learn more from the regions and how can we truly represent them and grow together
should we not be taking more risks in growing developing and connecting to the regions
training courses have been provided with some regularity in europe since
undertook the first iteration of om buds training in africa in and at the time of this writing the first foundations of organizational ombudsman practice and other courses were successfully concluded in south africa
additionally the has had successful programme of annual conference scholarships for members from developing countries
practically such funding helps ensure participation particularly where an absence of formal invitation or conference role might otherwise prevent funding for attendance from an own organization
the seeds sown from this scholarship programme have helped nurture the reach as seen in the recent south african training programme mentioned above
having shown how successful such outreach and connection with the regions can be let us plan for more and more regularly
accordingly would like to propose that the current systems for feedback and application of lessons learned from the regions be afforded greater focus and attention by the board committees and the management partner
the aim would be simply to ensure that the association acknowledges and responds to the activities issues and needs of ombudsmen in the regions more easily openly and actively
the fact of the matter is that now in our tenth year the and our profession has more to offer and more to learn from the regions and we should seize those opportunities
as participant in that bangkok gathering was moved and grateful for the excellent content the reassurance that came with sharing and modelling of approaches and experience and the camaraderie of fellow ombudsmen in the asia pacific region
that workshop was an excellent model for the to follow and learn from
of course pr ac ti ca li ties such as financial cost may make regional activities less viable
but we need to know and learn from observations from the regions if our profession is to grow in relevance across the globe
otherwise we might find that our current standards of practice make cultural engagement more difficult in professional settings where for example taking initiative is regarded as equivalent to insubordination or the power of hierarchy is beyond the scope of traditional western egalitarianism
perhaps the nuances of language need local refinement in way that challenges the certainties of our present published standards
some practical suggestions for enabling stronger feedback and operational is ing lessons from the regions might ensure that members practitioners and professionals in the different regions have equitable access to the its bodies services and opportunities for example by ensuring that the regional networks such as the ra cs have clear roles in relation to the and the ability to have exchanges on regional needs and share developments with the board and all the standing establish minimum quota of annual conference presentations from regional ombudsmen eg by ensuring that there are presentations devoted to feedback from each of the regions in plenary session as used to be the case with the ensure rotation of annual conference locations beyond the united states eg at least one in three conferences to be held beyond north america the title of the course om buds was changed to foundations of organizational ombudsman practice when the content was revised in recent years
journal of the international ombudsman association david commit to at least one regional training opportunity annually in each region outside north reserve minimum of three positions on the board of directors for ombudsmen from outside the united states
and now for the second broad theme our need as profession to critically strengthen our internal self regulation
in my annual ombudsman reports for the global fund have made reference to the issues raised by visitors in the context of life miller
this field of enquiry has many pathways some of them interesting for an association like the
for example given the extent and sophistication of the functioning it is reasonable to assert that we have moved to the stage of professional have professional support policy and procedural guidance and task forces
having said that recent searching critique of our profession was recently made by attorney and om buds observer charles howard in plenary speech at the annual conference
he touched on key challenges he saw facing the profession including the relative insularity of the ombudsman profession the need for better decision making processes our professional need for greater internal and external accountability the necessity of developing third party evaluations of ombudsman programmes and practitioners the importance of ombudsmen having better io af ac il it ated support including access to lawyers through the and the need for the profession to revisit the code of ethics and standards of practice howard
want to follow on later from some of these suggestions and will do so through the vehicle of issues that emerged during my recent tenure as editor of the journal of the international ombudsman association
the point wish to make with these examples is that the ability to demonstrate clear capacity for internal self regulation and accountability is crucial for our professional credibility and respect internally and externally
to begin would like to spell out the circumstances of question that came in the form of an email whilst was the editor of the journal of the international ombudsman association
the correspondent person asked if the journal would accept for publication critique of an organizational practice
as was my normal practice when potential author approached the editorial board about possible topic suggested by return that we talk by phone
the correspondent agreed to this and sent some additional documentation that verified an allegation of breach of the standards of practice
in other words this was not said she situation documents substantiated the verifiable complaints that person wished to put into print
in our telephone call it was clear the correspondent was hurt offended and disadvantaged as result of the described lapses in the practice standards of the ombudsman involved
the complainant was suffering and insistent that the verifiable actions of the ombudsman were not the of the situation
other complaints about ombudsman misconduct of which have been aware have included an instance of verified plagiarism documented instance of public disorderly conduct and an om journal of the international ombudsman association david miller buds man who was proven to have lied about their qualifications in their curriculum vitae cv
other reported instances of ombudsman misconduct have included allegations of an ombudsman allegedly engaged in conflict of interest adultery within the organization frequent ombudsman who routinely failed to respond to visitors and an ombudsman apparently routinely sharing information with management without visitor consent to do so
although employers intervened in some of these cases in only one instance mentioned here did the ombudsman lose their apparent standing visa vis the
if am identified as having committed misconduct as an ombudsman at my place of work it would be possible at present for me to move to another employer and work as an ombudsman
this is because we the or the ombudsman profession have no current instruments for self regulation of proven misconduct other than an instance in which the practitioner is certified through the board of certification for certified organizational ombudsman practitioners coop and another certified organizational ombudsman practitioner lays the complaint
coming back to person sought advice from close colleagues and the president of the board of directors
took the view supported by my colleagues that the journal was not the forum for ventilating this did not wish to publish paper so obviously targeting colleague where only one side of the story would be presented and when there might be more satisfactory options available
it also seemed obvious to me that the correspondent wanted to be heard and wanted some investigation andor accountability exercised over the actions of the ombudsman by the peers
in sum however when it came to accountability for the behaviour as professional body could demonstrate none
processes for internal self regulation for an association like ours are complex because they typically involve fine meshing of policy procedure and law
in addition to being an organizational ombudsman am registered clinical psychologist and as prerequisite of maintaining my licence to practice am required to abide by the code of conduct of my professional society in my case the new zealand college of clinical psychologists
further my professional conduct is subject to scrutiny by the new zealand board legislatively mandated body responsible for matters of quality in all things to do with psychological practice
this is relatively common structural approach to the administration of complaints through professional associations they are linked to disciplinary tribunals grounded in national or state laws and implemented through national or state bodies charged with legislative oversight of the conduct
as clinical practitioner have always worked within the law whilst sometimes responsibly challenging it
all over the world it has been my experience that the law is an ally just as due process and fair process are often allies for ombudsman visitors
the reason for examining such an issue is simply based in my wish that our profession is able to formalise its moral authority by demonstrating its mechanisms of internal and external accountability
it is also based in the fact that assembling such mechanism leads to options for strengthening our professional practice in other additional ways
because we are an international association with colleagues working in huge number of independent sovereign legal jurisdictions how can internal self regulation grounded in national and state laws possibly work
if we are to follow the model offered by many professional associations think we need to consider doing the following journal of the international ombudsman association david miller
separate the realms of national or state legislative requirements from that of professional membership requirements when complaints are laid
ensure we have clearly articulated and relevant principles for membership behaviour eg our current standards of practice and code of ethics
have an standing committee on professional conduct as with the board of professional practices committee
have on call legal support for the membership and for the
have on call support for best practices for practitioners and other organizational actors stake holders who want to discuss what best practices based on our standards and code of ethics look like and how to effectively integrate them
develop clearly articulated process for visitors andor members to follow when they seek to make complaints this includes concerns that may be raised by colleagues about an behaviour
we have an excellent template for this purpose in the complaints procedure of the board of certification
have an ombudsman service for organizational zero barrier office for ombudsman practitioners in which visitors can confidentially share information review options and receive information on appropriate referrals and potential interventions
this service would stand as complement to the board based response options when complaints arise
this model is available in other professional contexts when for example medical staff and health practitioners are subject to complaints or legal action
it is all the more relevant as possible prevention option when we are small organization and allegations of misconduct may be accordingly magnified both internally and externally
any complaints process worth its salt would require an adherence to administrative and legal fairness
those subject to complaints would be given full opportunity to answer any allegations in setting that is neutral impartial confidential and in which only relevant information is considered in context whose possible outcomes are not predetermined and which are proportional to the proven allegations
so in the case of person if we had such measures in place workable complaints procedure might work as following receipt of the complaint to the standing committee the would acknowledge receipt and send person an information sheet identifying likely steps and copy of the complaint would be sent to the identified ombudsman or copy would be sent also to the legal the standing committee would then commence its process of information gathering
this could be determined to some degree by the nature of the allegation
it would likely involve review of relevant available documentation
the identified person or office would be given the opportunity to give their side without advice or input from the standing committee
once all the information is in it would be sent in the most appropriate form back to the complainant and respondent person and the relevant ombudsman with the question this an accurate account as you see it
the standing committee would then convene subcommittee to triage out those matters worthy of further investigation for example in the case of falsified cv or substantiated violations of standards
of course it may be that there is insufficient evidence to be worthy of action by the
journal of the international ombudsman association david the subcommittee would write summary of the case and its reviewed elements and give an opinion on what should happen next
some options might no further sending an advisory letter to the practitioner eg recommended actions to be taken including training mentor ing or regular discussion with appointing an independent panel to conduct full investigation eg the panel would comprise three independent board appointed individuals at least two of whom must be certified organizational ombudsmen referring cases that involve suspected criminality to competent organizational and national or state authorities
the relevant steps would then be taken
where the board judged the matter to be within its professional remit they would notify the complainant and the ombudsman of the outcome and act according to the recommendation of its subcommittee or independent panel
this suggested process is illustrated in figure below
in its first ten years those who have served us all through the phases of evolution of the are responsible for our professional maturation and we owe them lasting debt of gratitude
the growth of the organization on all levels serves as model for organizational development
because of that if it is not already being done would urge that key function of the association is curat ing its history
this is because the history of our own species repeatedly illustrates that as we grow we forget
and although lessons in organizational they philosophical ideological practical or even be absorbed in the growing accretion of organizational lore that we increasingly come to see as way things the logic of those lessons will remain and will have instructive power as questions about the way things are arise in the future
but this is the case only if they are recorded
and this is not defensive should be celebrating how we are not just what we are
journal of the international ombudsman association david miller in this presentation have talked about mary extraordinary foundation building and continuing expansive contributions our growing internationalism and how our strengthened internal self regulation can benefit our internal and external professional credibility
as come to conclude have to confess that have been lamentably late convert to the truth that in life as in art and in science and in love the best destination is the journey itself
as proud new zealander like to offer sentinel poem from one of our finest poets james man of deep spirituality who towards the end of his life lived on the remote banks of one of our mightiest rivers the whang an ui
think this poem is especially fitting for ombudsmen high country weather alone we are born and die alone yet see the red gold cirrus over snow mountain shine
upon the upland road ride easy stranger surrender to the sky your heart of anger
upon our upland road our profession is solidly launched and our journey is well and inevitably underway
as described earlier believe it is possible to support assert and emulate our current standards of practice whilst in addition upholding the obligation to dissent
these are not incompatible positions and their inherent tension can help generate vital professional creativity if they are respectfully entwined
this expression of support and dissent is respectfully proposed and most gratefully given in honour of mary ro we

journal of the international ombudsman association
journal of the international ombudsman association in this article we offer two ideas that one book can challenge all ombudsmen to consider their work through new lens and that om buds can learn together in way that may provide model for shared learning
this article will first offer review of an influential new text for our field
second we will outline the learning model that we developed to guide our work and that could serve as template for other practitioners interested in engaging in similar dialogues
paradox book review polarities framing ombudsman reflective practice conflict theory professional development jenna brown jan morse and jim wo hl embracing paradox three om buds and book
journal of the international ombudsman association jenna brown jan morse and jim previous books include beyond neutrality staying with conflict and the dynamics of conflict
they reflected the thoughts and feelings about his work in dispute resolution and offered ideas that informed our views and our practices
without knowing exactly what the conflict paradox would offer we were interested in most recent observations and reflections
we were also interested in how book could affect our work
the conflict paradox is the ideal text for new or experienced ombudsman who is looking to enrich and further develop his or her practice
paradox is two seemingly contradictory truths both of which are indeed true
the first commonly used handbook on negotiation techniques was getting to yes originally published more than years ago by harvard negotiation project faculty members roger fisher and william
it assisted those working with disputing parties such as mediators and ombudsmen but its basic approach and well worn metaphors describing approaches to problem solving and focused on the transactional level of dispute resolution and was thus limited in scope
book builds on the early work of fisher and to fully develop bridge to deeper understanding of the nature of conflict
he constructs framework of paradoxes that are central to the work of conflict interveners
mayer borrows from philosophy and science as physicist niels bo hr said great truth is truth whose opposite is also great sch roed er
herein lies the power of the paradox framework
it is lens to examine situation from multiple points of view through process of dialectical inquiry which aims to discover truth through examining and interrogating competing ideas perspectives or arguments
in conflict setting the end result of this analysis may be richer understanding of the issues and better resolution for the parties
book invites the reader to transcend the binary frames by which conflicts are commonly understood as means to gain deeper understanding and open potential paths forward
his target audience includes mediators om buds coaches and conflict participants
as he states in the preface to the conflict paradox much of the conflict literature is geared toward the pr ac ti ca li ties of improving communication reappraising positions and seeking cooperation
greater concern however is how to navigate those pr ac ti ca li ties in chaotic world of human society fraught with intense emotions complex interactional systems long histories and troubling power
road map is to de construct the seemingly contradictory choices or polarities by which conflict is framed for disputants themselves and the interveners who assist the parties in resolving their conflict
the subtitle seven dilemmas at the core of disputes reflects the polarities explored in the core of the book competition and cooperation optimism and realism avoidance and engagement principle and compromise neutrality and advocacy emotion and logic and autonomy and community
the text squarely rejects the notion that the polarities in these paradoxes are opposites and instead encourages readers to become comfortable with them as
concluding the book is particularly well crafted final chapter that will lead the reader to explore the endless paradoxes native to their personal and professional lives beyond conflict
the interconnectedness of these seemingly mutually exclusive polarities drives thesis and challenges the body of literature on conflict analysis and intervention
drawing on philosophy biology conflict research psychology and the own experience as mediator mayer proposes journal of the international ombudsman association that neither polarity is actually viable without its corresponding opposite
the second chapter on the paradox of and is notable example of approach
after analyzing the thomas kil mann conflict styles inventory and the lax and se beni us to explain the distinctions between cooperating and competing he launches into discussion of the evolution of the competitive cooperative paradox using game theory via robert the evolution of cooperation
here mayer shows us how experimentation with the dilemma revealed that an optimally successful game strategy was competitive approach characterized as being provocative forgiving and mayer
mayer illuminates the winning strategy not as an either or strategic choice but rather an example of cooperation as method of competition and the simultaneous use of competitive strategy as means of cooperation
in the chapter exploring the paradox of and mayer draws on theories from family therapy sociology and biology even referencing work on the social life of spiders
to demonstrate the interconnectedness of the individual self and the community
own personal journey living in collective communities is especially informative in this chapter
for mayer posture of cooperation cannot be understood without recognizing simultaneously the element of competition optimism cannot exist without realism logic and emotion are never truly devoid of the other compromise without principles is as illusory as principles without compromise
this premise challenges the reader to seek and embrace in each conflict reality that encompasses the continuum of human responses
through this lens of paradoxes mayer finds enriched understanding of the sources of and responses to conflict
for conflict interveners especially this enriched understanding creates possibilities for reframing metaphor exploration and solutions
woven throughout the text are case examples of how the conflict paradox is accessible to the parties engaged in conflict and the conflict interveners
to demonstrate furthering principles through compromise mayer relates narrative involving an emergency room patient who suffered misdiagnosis resulting in negative consequences for her health and finances
attempts to seek resolution through meetings with the hospital staff were unproductive
the discussions alternatively focused on compromised financial solution and the values of acknowledging responsibility as well as the harm she experienced and preventing the problem from happening to another patient
these discussions failed to reach mutually acceptable resolution
however in subsequent mediated discussion between the patient her own physician and the emergency hospital administration the patient found way to express her underlying principles while also working toward an acceptable financial settlement
while conventional interpretation of this episode might center on the distinction between competing positions and interests la fisher and or prior it izing principles in order to choose where to compromise appraisal of the elements of the negotiation are more nuanced
the resource centered focus of the hospital administrators and the values important to the patient representing the paradox of compromise and principles each informed at times exacerbated and ultimately facilitated solution
compromise was the path by which the patient was able to further her principles while the administrators arrived at financial solution through engagement in discussion of values their own as well as those held by the patient
rather than polarities compromise and principles distinct but
in addition to such case examples interspersed among the discussions of science and conflict theory mayer includes practical from sections that draw on the extensive experiences as mediator and sometimes conflict participant in exploring the relevant paradoxes
jenna brown jan morse and jim wo hl journal of the international ombudsman association if om buds and mediators have become comfortable even reliant on the polarities in which people approach disputes the conflict paradox presents nuanced and persuasively argued alternate reality
when the polarities mayer explores are perceived as mutually exclusive choices they trap disputants and interveners into choosing divergent realities viewing them as paradoxes challenges disputants and all parties to engage in more intellectually and emotionally sophisticated level of understanding that invites truth embraces the unity of both
there is elegance to both writing and his argument
focusing on desired outcome and providing opportunities for genuine growth can help the parties from destructive to creative
mayer states that diversity complexity clarity and simplicity are necessary to find the underlying unity beyond seeming opposites
when using paradox lens simplistic clarity is abandoned in favor of deeper dive into an examination of the nature of the conflict
integration of polarities provides the opportunity to examine the issues across broader landscape of possibilities
mayer who uses the terms neutrality and impartiality interchangeably argues that conflict interveners are well served when they adopt strategy that integrates neutrality with advocacy work as interveners requires that we learn to function as both advocates and neutrals to fulfill our commitment to our clients and to promote constructive approach to
mayer identifies three key skills of the advocate communication strategic thinking and emotional management
his advice to conflict interveners is to focus on effective coaching and problem solving be empathetic and caring do not take on the pain anger or fear avoid rescue strategies and know how to intervene in complex systems
mayer acknowledges what many om buds have long suspected that just not possible to be neutral all the time and okay
the paradox framework is an approach to help om buds make sense of conflict for themselves and for and with parties
it is usual for people in conflict and who are so close to their problems to lose sight of their situation or to be constrained in narrow and ineffective view
the ombudsman using the paradox framework can help parties acknowledge the real and contrasting truths of their situation freeing them to consider alternatives and approaches that can lead to effective resolutions
and the framework scales up to the organizational level as om buds identify systemic issues and work to change dysfunctional and complex systems problems
engaging in conflict intervention through the paradox lens seems to require the particular skills of suspension of judgment and tolerance of ambiguity
there may be challenges in using this model in situations where the intervener or the parties may lack the skills needed to manage the complexities that arise
even as seasoned practitioners we found this book to be very provocative and challenging particularly the chapter on neutrality and advocacy
therefore we appreciate invitation to all conflict interveners to venture out beyond the comfortable and well defined world of absolutes into the rich and messy uncertainty of paradox
we could have each read this book on our own but we felt that reading it together with people who do similar work would provide us with an opportunity to deepen our experience with this book its ideas and its application to our work
it also would allow us to share meaningful connection with one another
jenna brown jan morse and jim wo hl journal of the international ombudsman association our plan read and discuss two chapters of the book at time and keep log about our impressions
we arranged monthly conference calls to discuss our reflections after which we circulated running notes to digest our conversations
in addition to our group calls we arranged conference call with mayer and howard gad lin then ombudsman at the national institutes of health who knows mayer and has long considered the work of the organizational ombudsman in different contexts
to prepare for the call with the author we each wrote questions in hopes of further illuminating what the book could offer to ombudsmen in particular
mayer explained that his intention in writing the book was not to create theoretical formulation but to use the concept of paradox to further our understanding of the world and our work and to apply the approach to conflict
he also wonders what is it that we actually do that makes difference and why some of things that we say are good things to do are actually good to do
our field is so full of aphorisms or little rules or beliefs if we can understand them at different
mayer said he wrote the book to
telephone interview october after the call our discussion had new book in written form as well as sharing our learning experience with others in the field
several elements made this exercise successful and could be replicated by others with an interest in following our experience and focus
we each brought significant experience as om buds and in reflecting on om buds work
enhancing our discussion was our ability to connect the topics in the book to actual casework without getting lost in the details of the case stories
we each had different and sometimes overlapping perspectives on an array of topics such as the om buds as intervener and addressing systemic change which made for richer dialogue than had we agreed on most points
we set pace that we felt was fast enough to keep everyone reading and slow enough to allow time to think and reflect
we read the book over period of three months and had four conference calls
each of us volunteered to lead some aspect of the project initiating the group and setting its pace recording and distributing notes leading the preparation for the meeting with the author and leading the writing project
by sharing the workload we were able to accomplish great deal in relatively short amount of time
reading the book together was from the start an exciting goal
engaging in meaningful dialogue with the author set up new tasks namely focusing our thoughts and questions
writing book review challenged us to put our thoughts into words for others outside of the group
however with good process and delegation of responsibilities we were able to realize these goals
at the beginning of each call we confirmed the purpose and goal of the call
near the end of every call we reflected on the experience thus far and confirmed the chapters to be read for the next call
minimal and inexpensive resources book phone email and the time
the authors agreed that the learning model worked very well for this book
this model gave us an opportunity to engage in detailed and informative discussions about important topics in the field of jenna brown jan morse and jim wo hl journal of the international ombudsman association dispute resolution
throughout our discussions it was useful to explore various perspectives on how the framework would work for om buds identify potential pitfalls and discuss ideas on how to incorporate the strategies mayer presents
taking on the challenge of the paradox framework was almost like learning new language
we helped each other test this new way of thinking and the means to express those new ideas
as the ombudsman profession continues to grow and evolve it is essential that practitioners seek to understand and work with emerging knowledge learned through experience
learning from new texts that feature emerging knowledge is benefit to practicing om buds and the ombudsman profession

introduction the authors of this paper are members of the baker hughes organizational om buds office which was established in with team of five professionals of varying backgrounds experience and skill sets
our aim in this paper is to share our team approach to an om buds office including reflections on our experiences to date
our hope is that this paper encourages additional dialogue about the team approach to an om buds office specifically or provides support to organizational om buds offices generally
purpose charter and governance in the chief executive officer of baker hughes endorsed the establishment of an organizational om buds office as new means for employees to raise issues and gain prompt assistance with workplace concerns
just prior to this time the company had completed significant organizational restructuring and sizeable acquisition
results of the employee engagement survey revealed confusion about existing sources of support and sense of disconnection from leadership
in response executive leadership aimed to address those concerns in part by establishing an om buds office as an additional and confidential resource of support and guidance for employees
leadership intended the om buds office to not internal sources of support such as representatives in human resources compliance safety and security
to help resolve confusion the om buds office would provide an easy point of contact for guidance through any work related concern including information about other internal sources of support
to help with connections the om buds office would add direct conduit to leadership
visionary leadership inspired the establishment of the om buds office and for nearly five years employees have benefited from having this meaningful source of individual and confidential guidance
the om buds office has supported employees in addressing their workplace concerns improving their communication skills upholding positive corporate culture preserving their relationships and promoting positive work environment
meanwhile through the om buds office the company has benefited from having the om buds support in maintaining an ethical and engaged workforce
while protecting the anonymity of callers the om buds office has informed leadership of emerging concerns enabling them to act timely and pro actively
wherever possible the om buds office has recommended improvements to practices and policies to minimize or prevent workplace issues
to encourage an engaged workforce the om buds office has assisted employees with communication negotiation team building and conflict management
the om buds office was established by charter setting forth the overall purpose structure responsibilities and governance of the om buds office including the expectations of om buds covered employees and management baker hughes
journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
each element of the om buds operations conforms to the international ombudsman association code of ethics and standards of practice sop international ombudsman association
the om buds office has access to the highest levels of the company and works with cross functional committee for performance and administrative purposes
the om buds governance committee is comprised of seven members including chair and four members who are appointed by the chief executive officer
the other two members come from below the executive level in the company and serve for two year term
the oversees the om buds performance of intended objectives and recommends opportunities to improve its integration into the organization
the has no knowledge of specific matters brought by employees to the om buds office
neither the nor any of its members may request or compel disclosure of confidential information brought to the om buds office
staffing team to enable quality service to enable quality service the om buds office was staffed with team of four key roles the principal om buds om buds information specialist and office coordinator
each role fulfills specific needs and contributes to the overall efficient functioning of the team
the principal om buds serves as an om buds particularly in situations involving high risk to the organization
in addition the principal serves as the primary point of contact to the office for executives and leaders of the company and supervises the om buds office staff
the principal and two other om buds provide traditional om buds services including guiding employees who are seeking assistance suggesting opportunities for systemic improvement and educating the employees on the unique nature of the om buds office
the information specialist is the primary gatherer and synthesizer of data resulting from cases that come to the om buds office
the information specialist serves in fulltime capacity which is rare in the om buds world and supports the goal of deriving maximum systemic benefits for the company while ensuring caller confidentiality
the coordinator serves as the initial and closing contact for employees reaching out to the office often acts as quick information source for callers and handles many administrative matters
to help accelerate the establishment the company sought external hires with prior experience and expertise in dispute resolution and organizational om buds work
three members of the team principal om buds and coordinator were external hires having over forty years of combined experience in conflict management organizational development and human resources from variety of industries and institutions
to embed institutional knowledge into the team two members of the team om buds and information specialist were internal hires having over fifty years of combined knowledge and history working for the organization
journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
reflection on staffing team to enable quality service we have found that staffing the om buds office with mix of people from within and outside the company helped the office become established and integrate more quickly and effectively
the external team members members of the team who came in from outside the company brought in relevant skills and experience which boosted the om buds credibility
being new to the company these team members lacked internal history roles or relationships that could have caused challenges in establishing the om buds neutrality
also the external team members were useful in questioning cultural practices that were new to them but had become commonplace to the internal team members
the internal team members were able to educate their external teammates about the structure culture policies and business practices
this helped prevent early missteps that could have occurred due to lack of familiarity with the company
in addition internal team members had established connections with important stake holders such as the human resources legal and compliance departments which were useful in creating inroads for the om buds office
in short the team has benefited from having nice balance of teammates with depth of experience within and outside the company
overall we believe it is worth the expense and effort to staff the om buds office with team of people in variety of roles
of course it is important to strike the right balance based on demand for use from employees served
we believe the team and the company have benefited from having dedicated roles to provide om buds work case intake data collection and reporting and connection to leadership
specifically staffing the om buds with team of roles has enabled us to meet demands as they arose draw on unique strengths of individual team members and harness the power of creative collaboration
as is true with any collaborative effort enabling strong team performance has taken significant time and energy
the team has come together numerous times every week to keep each other updated concerning cases and informed of company developments
in the following pages we will review each role on the team including descriptions contributions and our reflections
coordinator role and contributions while the office coordinator coordinator fulfills variety of roles the most critical is to be the initial face and voice of the om buds office for callers
most callers are first time users of the office
they may have read or heard about om buds but before their first experience they are not sure what to expect
in addition they are often distressed andor in the midst of conflict
caller who is distressed or in conflict needs positive first contact to feel confident about resource he or she has never used before
journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
in the initial call the coordinator has several key goals including serving as warm yet professional voice of the office while potentially calming and providing hope to troubled person giving very brief sense of the specialized role of an organizational om buds office mentioning the four ethical principles of independence neutrality informality and confidentiality assessing the nature of the as an informational request readily handled on the spot by the coordinator or as case requiring session scheduled with the om buds and identifying special considerations such as technical or cultural implications involvement of high ranking personnel ethical implications or other circumstances which could impact assignment to specific om buds
when the caller makes request for information or referral that may be fulfilled without need of an om buds the coordinator deems the call and assists the caller directly
empowering the coordinator to provide such service gives callers immediate help which sends clear signal of the support of employees
as the coordinator is member of the om buds office which promises confidentiality to employees this initial discussion is likewise explicitly confidential relieving the caller of any concerns about repercussions
when the coordinator determines that the caller would benefit from meeting with an om buds to express concerns and explore options for resolution they offer to assign the to an om buds and to schedule the initial session between the caller and an om buds
the coordinator takes into account the convenience of time for the caller availability of an om buds the need if any for specialized knowledge and the balance of case assignments among the team
if the caller is physically located near the assigned office the coordinator can offer the session either in person or via telephone
after the initial call the coordinator assigns call number whether case or contact and completes an intake form and cover sheet including essential details about the caller and their concerns
in the intake form the assigned om buds receives the name telephone number and essential concerns of the caller
in the cover sheet the coordinator has method to keep track of open cases
while the case is active the om buds retains the intake form and notes on developments in the case
after the case is closed the intake form cover sheet and notes taken by the om buds during casework are destroyed
whereas certain case related information is entered into database no caller identifying information is entered
this process allows us to maintain our confidentiality commitment identify and report broad usage statistics and remain aligned with the sop requirement of keeping no case records standard of practice
depending upon circumstances the coordinator may participate in case categorization sessions which can add number of benefits to the process
for instance the journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
coordinator may offer insight into the initial concerns based on information shared at intake
in addition the coordinator provides another set of eyes and ears for improved consistency in case categorization
also if the career goals include developing into an om buds role conducting intake participating in case categorization sessions and hearing about om buds case management practices provides excellent exposure and opportunities to learn
our office desires to survey users regarding services and the coordinator role is well suited to conduct such surveys
the caller knows the coordinator from the initial intake so when the coordinator calls to conduct the survey there is little likelihood that the caller would be alarmed or concerned
also having the coordinator conduct the surveys lends some separation from the om buds with whom the caller worked which increases the likelihood in receiving unfiltered feedback
participation in the user survey is voluntary the coordinator invites but does not require the caller to participate
any responses remain anonymous even to the om buds only the coordinator knows who made the comments
the coordinator also provides administrative support to the om buds team
if the individual in the coordinator role has the necessary skill set and so desires he or she can assist in the development of various marketing and outreach materials
reflection on the coordinator role as previously mentioned the coordinator serves as central point of contact for the om buds office which has been important as our team members are based in multiple locations
the coordinator has played an integral part of conducting case intake assigning cases planning outreach campaigns handling logistics and coordinating details between colleagues in other departments and om buds team members
the coordinator also has conducted some outreach activities on behalf of the office handing out literature and answering questions at employee events
most importantly the coordinator has been the first and last voice that caller heard when contacting the om buds office
from the coordinator callers received calm and compassionate person who put them at ease when they were upset
the coordinator helped reduce caller apprehension in using the om buds office by explaining the purpose of the office hearing the essence of the concerns and scheduling cases with om buds
in those instances when the coordinator was out of the office and an om buds took call cold by directly answering an incoming call we noticed decrease in the preparedness to work with the om buds
in contrast the om buds noticed positive impact on our working with callers by having the coordinator separately handle the intake stage of the process
not only has the coordinator helped reduce fear of using the office the coordinator helped ready the employee to work well with an om buds
even when the meeting with the om buds has been the very day after intake with the journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
coordinator by that time and with the contributions the employee has been better equipped to work effectively through their concerns
occasionally callers have been frustrated or confused about having to explain their concerns to the coordinator and then again to the assigned om buds
in our experience we have been able to reduce this confusion when the om buds has recapped briefly the essence of the concerns that the coordinator captured from the case intake call
by doing this the caller has understood that communication has sense honoring the caller for the time already spent talking with the coordinator
typically this has encouraged the caller to invest more time by sharing details of the concerns with the om buds
information specialist role and contributions the information specialist specialist provides the team with meaningful data analyses and quality reporting to help the office recommend systemic improvements to leadership and demonstrate the value of the om buds office
as fulltime member of the om buds team the specialist makes the same commitment to confidentiality as other team members and has access to case data
the specialist gathers data gleaned from om buds casework enters case related data into database specifically designed for om buds casework and organizes the data into easily digested formats including graphs tables and descriptions
the om buds team regularly reviews these graphs and tables to consider their use in reports to leadership and management
such reports present an overview of the nature of concerns brought by callers without compromising caller confidentiality
in addition the reports provide leadership summary of the issues impacting morale performance efficiency and productivity
the specialist is responsible for managing the structure and use of the database
in addition the specialist makes sure that the database aligns with the sop
to conform to confidentiality requirements the specialist excludes all caller identifying information from the database ensures that the database and servers are secured by data encryption and physical protection and oversees regular schedule of case related document destruction standard of practice
in addition the specialist limits access to the database only to members of the om buds office
the specialist customizes the database to reflect the operating structure and the nature of issues identified by the om buds team
as the company changes its operating structure the specialist alters the database to align with changes to business segments facilities and product lines
the specialist enters and maintains the quality of the data in the database to ensure that data being captured is current consistent and correct
the specialist runs reports comparing case data to organizational statistics
data can be analyzed by geography business segment demographics and nature of concerns
the journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
specialist enters relevant case related information into the database such as information about the nature of concerns eg categories dimensions and issues and demographics and physical location of callers
again the specialist carefully excludes names and other caller identifying information standard of practice
with input from the om buds who worked the case the specialist enters additional relevant information such as the amount of time caller had been dealing with the issues other resources involved eg business or how the caller has been impacted eg or and om buds actions in assisting the caller eg or
including all this information in the database allows the team to identify patterns of concerns whether pertaining to the company overall or particular business unit or facility
in addition the principal can ask the specialist to run reports to assess the performance for instance identifying most common om buds activities and effective outreach methods
the specialist also draws on data generated by the other departments such as human resources
when gathering such data the specialist disguises the specific use of the data to ensure caller confidentiality
for instance the specialist may request broader dataset than needed or seek information in the form of report rather than running specialized queries or making inquiries about individuals
when reaching out to others in the company for information the specialist requests data in raw form rather than generating specific query that might identify the caller or concerns
reflection on the information specialist role the information specialist role has provided tremendous value to our om buds office
having dedicated fulltime employee with skills in data analytics and reporting who is covered by the confidentiality requirements has enabled the team to prepare meaningful reports that convey relevant information to the stake holders
with support from the specialist we have been able to manage and appropriately share data equipping leadership and management with important factual information that contributes to informed decision making
in short the specialist role enables the om buds office to provide positive data driven systemic impact on the organization
as mentioned previously we staffed the specialist with an internal hire whose experience in data analytics and reporting was based on the systems and culture
the prior knowledge and mastery of many of the reporting systems and data gathering platforms expanded the breadth of the reporting capabilities
for instance the specialist had access and ability to draw reports from the human resources information system which allows the om buds to conduct appropriate information gathering on an informal basis
the specialist came to the om buds office with ample experience in data and analytics but without prior knowledge or experience of the om buds function
to help the specialist assimilate to the om buds team and perform in the role the specialist underwent journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
foundations training with the and has attended annual conferences both as participant and presenter
in addition the specialist has participated as member of the communications committee and in other relevant organizations
these have been real investments in the education and experiences which have brought about improved functioning for the team
because of these investments the specialist has fully integrated into the team participating in all team meetings contributing to team discussions and even filling in for the coordinator by conducting case intake and case surveys
om buds role and contributions casework practices and conflict management consultation are the core work of om buds
despite unique experiences education and skill sets each om buds offers common core competencies and strategies to ensure consistent and reliable service
such core competencies include mastery of conflict skills and theories of negotiation such as interest based negotiation
organizational om buds practice according to the sop
because each situation is unique an om buds adapts to the person and situation and employs variety of approaches to build connection and offer high quality service to the caller
while working with caller the om buds explains the role of the om buds and how the process works listens with compassion to the caller clarifies concerns identifies possible goals and explores the options and potential outcomes
depending on circumstances the om buds may also provide information on policies or programs give feedback help the caller with strategy or serve as sounding board
typically the om buds works one on one with caller from the outset of the case to its closure
however an om buds may confer with team members to seek support or guidance in working with difficult issue
on rare occasion an om buds may explore transferring the case to another om buds if the original om buds identifies potential conflict of interest or has personal reaction to caller that may compromise neutrality
employees sometimes come to the om buds office as last resort when conflict has escalated and relationships are damaged
it is not uncommon for an om buds to hear complex and challenging dilemmas
in these more difficult situations the its provide dual support
first it can enhance the experiences
second it can provide essential support to the om buds working the case
with regular practice of coming together to discuss active cases each om buds gains essential support and constructive feedback to better manage cases
specifically team feedback in case reviews empowers the om buds by tapping into the wealth of wisdom of diverse knowledge skills and abilities sharing learning and hearing about similar circumstances journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
generating or testing ideas surfacing missing information and trying new approaches enabling supportive and gentle way to hold one another accountable to the sop and expressing personal responses to difficult cases supporting one another and developing healthy self care tools and strategies
reflection on the om buds role it is important for an om buds office to be connected to the organization it serves
gaining and maintaining credibility with key stake holders while keeping adequate independence can be delicate business and the saying heads are better than has rung true for us
having three om buds working from variety of locations has helped the team keep broader pulse on the climate learn about new developments adapt with change and manage through the organizational culture
in addition as mentioned previously having om buds with diversity in background and experiences has enriched the thinking empowering it to envision new approaches to challenges and influence change
the success of an om buds office is often built on reputation of trust
as such trust builds over time the om buds office becomes more effective
over the past four plus years each om buds has contributed directly to the reputation of trust through connections with callers leaders and stake holders across the company
however three om buds can only reach so far
as is true for many organizations our company operates across large geography
we have found it challenging to stay connected to thousands of employees working in hundreds of facilities
even with the om buds working in several locations the potential to develop connections and gain information has been constrained somewhat
just as no two artists paint alike no two om buds work alike
in our experience each of the three om buds has approached om buds work in unique way drawing on their own set of strengths skills education and experiences
the richness inherent in these different approaches comes to life in case reviews where one om buds debriefs the case and gains wisdom from the wealth of strengths skills education and experiences of the other om buds
in this way each of us has been enriched and our callers benefit from the strengths of the entire team
principal om buds role and contributions as an om buds the principal om buds principal delivers om buds services to the company
in addition the principal provides leadership for the om buds office
in particular the principal oversees development implementation integration and outreach efforts for initial launch expansion and communication of the office
this includes public relations activities to raise visibility awareness and understanding of the om buds office across the organization
the principal consults with executive journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
in particular the chief executive legal and human resources review the contributions from the om buds office and keep them apprised of the general nature of employee concerns and systemic issues
the principal ensures the execution of written charter outlining the mandate purpose and structure of the om buds office and adherence to the sop
in addition the principal establishes and monitors effective processes and procedures for the operations
the principal builds and supports team of individuals to ensure the office delivers value added results
specifically the principal directs all aspects of the om buds team performance including learning and development training business goals performance reviews and succession planning
in addition the principal supports each om buds team member in attaining and maintaining the certified organizational ombudsman practitioner coop designation
the principal oversees the design and delivery of variety of aggregated case data reports to leadership and employees relating to the overall nature of concerns and usage of the om buds office
leadership reports are tailored to provide aggregated case data about caller concerns from the business segment
annual reports to employees provide updates on the om buds performance and contributions
these reports may include the nature of concerns received and hypothetical scenarios with examples of om buds actions
such reports remind employees of the availability of the office and encourage its use
all reports are carefully prepared to protect confidentiality
along with other members of the team the principal identifies trends that may have negative impacts for the company and positive impacts of decisions or changes that might have gotten little attention
the principal offers recommendations through upward feedback and outward communication to increase understanding and improve outcomes
the principal serves as resource and advisor on organizational concerns identifying and analyzing gaps between the stated goals and actual practices
the principal consults with leadership and management on possible organizational changes promoting learning and improved communication at all levels
reflection on the principal role as practicing om buds the principal provides om buds services to employees of all functions and levels
to be of maximum assistance in casework the principal works to engender trust and establish genuine rapport
like the other om buds the principal uses om buds skills to listen offer feedback and provide guidance to better equip and prepare callers in addressing their issues effectively
in most instances any om buds can be assigned to handle case that comes into the office
on occasion either the nature of the concerns or other circumstances cause us to view the case as having heightened sensitivity or risk
in such an instance we have found it helpful to assign the case to the journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
regardless of the risk or severity of the case the continued involvement in casework is essential to the overall performance and cohesion
without such regular practice in casework the principal would be less attuned to the climate and hampered in ability to identify systemic concerns
like all members of the om buds office the principal presents face for the om buds office to the population to inspire trust and promote usage
we understand that the role of the om buds and even the name itself is odd and relatively unfamiliar
by presenting the faces names and contact information of all team members including the we have intended to make the office more approachable and accessible
broadly speaking the communications with the covered population are intentionally personal welcoming and open
beginning in following the first full year of our operations every annual report of the om buds office has always included letter addressed to covered employees and signed by the principal
we believe using personal approach such as providing all names and photos of the team in reports and on our web site has helped present the om buds office as an accessible resource for employees when they need help
the principal brings issues forward to leadership
when conveying messages the principal considers wide range of factors and priorities set within the context of the culture and industry
the company operates in the oil and gas industry which requires keen focus on market that can rapidly impact our operations
mindful of this focus the principal considers changing business conditions and the employee climate when bringing issues forward
issues may involve perceived concerns missed opportunities or potential vulnerabilities
considering range of factors the principal ascertain whether when and how to bring concerns to leadership
and once brought the principal presents the information in way that engages dialogue and discussion even when the news may be difficult to hear
as manager of the om buds team the principal oversees the performance and development of team members manages budgets and governs all administrative aspects of the office
as an administrator the principal draws on distinct set of skills not necessarily required as an om buds such as time management resource allocation staffing and budget decisions
while the principal must provide leadership to the team and the company the principal must also provide competent administrative and people management skills
to balance these dual sets of responsibilities the principal has needed to focus sufficient attention to both leadership and administrative management
lastly and most importantly the principal must ensure that the om buds office itself stays true to ethical principles and operates with integrity
this has been especially true these initial years of our operation
misstep in the first few years could have caused irreparable confusion distrust resentment and possibly even questioning the value of the office
while all team members share in the accountability of operating with journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
integrity the principal bears the ultimate responsibility for actions taken by the office or individual team members and ensuring overall adherence to ethical principles
magic of the team approach as already described our om buds office was established with team approach in mind
now in our fifth year in operation we remain grateful for our team structure and impressed by the wisdom it brings
from the very beginning we knew we needed method to capture the concerns we were hearing
we chose to adapt the uniform reporting categories tool developed by diverse team of respected om buds international ombudsman association
we believed that beginning with the and its nine categories of concerns would enable us to gather and report on high level data from our caseload internally with our leaders and compare our experiences with those of other organizational om buds offices
its nine categories give us common language and great beginning
over time within the nine categories we have added dimensions and issues as they were expressed by employees resulting in new tool that developed from the yet was customized for our company
we consider our baker hughes working document adding new issues as they emerge in our casework
as an example our compensation and benefits category one of nine categories has grown from an initial five dimensions with issues to dimensions with issues
with our adapted in hand we engage the wisdom in process we call or for short
briefly case cat involves team meetings in person or via web phone to debrief current cases and categorize the issues
with three om buds handling cases we anticipated challenge in achieving consistency in issue identification
we realized that each of us might interpret the issues slightly differently if data were captured inconsistently reports from the database would be unreliable
our leadership wanted to learn about employee concerns and the value the office was adding to the company and we planned to rely on reports from our caseload to inform them
to ensure consistency in data gathering and to develop reliable reports we draw on the wisdom by debriefing and categorizing cases together
as noted issue identification is team exercise
we come together in case cat at least once per week to debrief and categorize active cases
the om buds handling case debriefs the case and describes the concerns
other members of the team listen along and generate lists of potential issues raised
once the om buds completes debrief the others recite issues they identified
the om buds who handled the case has the final say about the issues that will be recorded in the database but issues that have been identified by two or more members of the team become persuasively appropriate
journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
obviously with all team members participating in case cat these meetings require significant investments of time and focus
reflection on the magic of the team approach we have reflected on the balance of our workload and consistently regard the case cat process as well worth the investment
we could have chosen to categorize cases individually and save this time for other work
but we have seen too much value come from case cat to give it up
for instance we have seen that we are not always consistent in our review of the issues
sometimes we categorize cases team members identifying almost all of the same issues
in most instances however each om buds categorizes cases at least little differently
with the benefit of considering wider range of potential issues the om buds handling the case selects the final set of issues that best captures the essential nature of the concerns
with all this team effort we set ourselves up for quality issue identification and ensure that our data and reports are as accurate and reliable as possible
our team approach to case cat gave us more than just improved quality and consistency in issue identification and reporting
over the years we began to realize added value brought by the experiences in case cat
below is list of the unexpected advantages typically we debrief cases while they are still open
new ideas and suggestions regularly arise
the om buds who is working case can relay these new options to the caller
as we review cases together we begin to identify common patterns and themes allowing us to timely inform leadership of emerging concerns or systemic issues
team members operate from multiple locations doing work that can be quite solitary
our case cat meetings build in regular connection and bonding that enrich and strengthen us
we have found this process to be an important way to process and release emotions that we may be carrying from the work we do
reviewing cases together has accelerated the sharing of knowledge and expertise which empowers us to better serve our callers and the company
at times each of us has found that om buds work can be isolating and emotionally draining
gathering together and sharing experiences has promoted feelings of inclusion and groundedness
our team approach to casework and conflict management consultation has helped us draw from the diversity in strength among team members has encouraged healthy connections and has promoted ongoing learning and creativity
though we have not found way to quantify it we suspect that our self care efforts have translated into better outcomes for the callers and the company
journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
adjunct services occasionally the om buds office receives requests for services beyond the conventional
when we receive such request we consider it carefully to ensure that performance of such work would align with the om buds charter and with the sop
we refer to these unconventional requests as
adjunct services may include small or large groups or even broader spectrum of employees across the company
adjunct service requests may include facilitation training workplace assessments mediation andor employee climate checks such as surveys interviews or focus groups
an adjunct service request can be more complex than the core work of one on one case management
usually there are number of people involved with different goals or perspectives
consultative approach works well to determine scope purpose outcomes time lines and resource requirements of each project
the initial information is typically gathered by one om buds leading the service
however the design and delivery of the service frequently involves at least two om buds
delivering adjunct services in this way allows the team to apply and develop broader spectrum of knowledge skills and abilities enable work to be distributed equitably among team members ensuring timely delivery foster diverse perspectives to generate creative solutions and produce better quality services create cohesion among team members and sometimes even help make work more fun
each om buds brings their unique style and perspective to practice and not every om buds has experience with all types of adjunct services
having two or more people offering group facilitation mediation or skills training allows the team to draw on strengths of individual team members and extend them to other om buds team members via co facilitation or training
adjunct services may be complex challenging and intense
designing the most appropriate process paying attention to details and noticing group dynamics while remaining neutral can be difficult for an om buds working alone
working as team provides for greater potential participant impacts as well as fostering healthy team relations
reflection on adjunct services our experiences using team approach to adjunct services such as facilitation or mediation has been advantageous to participants
specifically the differences among the om buds themselves styles age nationality backgrounds work experiences etc
have helped participants find connection and gain comfort with what is usually new and journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
also as om buds team members worked cooperatively they offered an excellent model of effective communication and collaborative problem solving
furthermore we believe that co facilitation has helped keep participants engaged and motivated
as two or more people shared content delivery they were better able to attend to participant comfort and security
as result we have experienced greater openness in discussions increased understanding and improved problem solving
the team approach to adjunct services has allowed us to draw on the strengths in our diversity of thought which enhanced the overall experiences of our participants and produced higher quality outcomes
adjunct services also offered advantages to om buds team members themselves
an om buds who observed peer in action enhanced learning and improved skills
as team members shared in group facilitation for instance the overall quality of the effort increased
having extra sets of ears eyes and hands enabled the fac il ita tors to pay attention to group dynamics and maintain the momentum of the group
in addition conducting adjunct services as team allowed each team member to conserve energy by providing breaks for each co facilitator
finally including check ins and discussions among co fac il ita tors as well as post session debriefs proved to be very useful in promoting individual learning and process improvement
reporting to the company reporting is done on quarterly semiannual annual and as needed basis depending on the intended audience and reasons for reporting
the reporting process requires the skills and contributions of the entire team
the specialist gathers and assimilates data drawn primarily from the database containing case related information and provides initial graphics for discussion and review with the principal and om buds
based on team discussions concerning the being told by the data the specialist further refines the analyses for subsequent review and discussion with team members
the coordinator contributes to team discussions and conducts the user satisfaction surveys
the specialist presents the analyses to the principal and om buds for review consideration and potential refinement
considering all input from the team the principal ultimately decides on the content and form of information to convey
as previously mentioned the coordinator conducts user satisfaction surveys by telephone on an ongoing basis
survey participation is voluntary and information may be offered anonymously
the coordinator places phone call to users of om buds services to gain feedback
specifically the survey includes five statements seeking feedback on their experiences with om buds services
one such statement on our survey is om buds helped me address my needs or helped me resolve my
the coordinator and specialist compile and analyze survey results for use in reports and on the internal web site
journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
reports are delivered quarterly to the due to its oversight function and in serving as an important connection between the om buds office and the company
the principal delivers these reports in person and via web in ar and includes usage statistics such as the comparative changes in call volume and an overall look at the issues employees are taking to the om buds office
in addition the principal relays emerging trends or systemic issues to the which considers this information and decides appropriate action as necessary
reports to the also include summaries from the user satisfaction surveys and comments given by employees so the has information about the quality of om buds services
reports are delivered semiannually and as needed to other important stake holders in the company including leaders of business segments or support functions such as human resources
in these reports leaders gain insight into the kinds of concerns their employees are having
leaders receive an overview of the categories dimensions and issues brought to the om buds office over specific time frames
reports carefully exclude any information that could reveal the identity of our callers and are not left behind
with the exception of the annual report which is disseminated by mail and electronically reports are delivered in person or by web in ar only
recipients never receive copy of the report in print or electronically
reflection on reporting to the company as the om buds office has matured the team has improved its ability to analyze and report on data
in our early years we provided reports on aggregated data covering the entire covered area
as time passed and our case volume increased we were able to sort data by segments such as our north american operations and corporate support functions
as further time passed and with enough cases to ensure validity we have been able to further sort data by narrowing the scope such as from all of north america to more specifically north america land or offshore groups or from all corporate support functions to more specifically the human resources function
the upside of the refined reports is that we have been able to reveal concerns or issues that were unique to particular group
as our leadership teams have remained most interested in hearing about the concerns of their own employees we have been able to respond with useful insights
the down sides of the refined reports relate to statistical reliability and confidentiality
as the scope of reporting has narrowed we have sometimes lacked sufficient volume to suggest common issue
in addition as the more narrowed reporting includes fewer matters we have remained on alert to protect caller confidentiality
our leadership teams have wanted to know whether issues may be emerging within specific facilities or product lines
without sufficient volume to warrant mention as common issue or trend we must keep with our confidentiality commitments to our callers
journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
as mentioned previously we have relayed systemic issues in our reporting process to deliver the information to appropriate members of leadership
we have developed methods to identify systemic issues involving the entire team
the case cat process has served as the primary mechanism to keep the team informed of active caseload
as common issues or trends have developed the team has been able to identify them readily through these regular case reviews
in addition in other team meetings we have identified systemic issues or emerging trends based on team member observations of organizational changes or developments
whether via case cat or other team meetings we believe that these team wide conversations about potential patterns or systemic issues have enabled us to fulfill our role as an agent of change and systemic improvement for the company
in essence our reporting has evolved in way that captures the perspectives of several om buds who have observed the company from variety of vantage points
rich dialogues about systemic issues have brought well rounded messages to the appropriate members of leadership in as relevant and timely format possible
marketing and education communications are vital in the initial establishment and continued education and outreach of an om buds office
our communications include brochures articles posted on the web site handouts and excerpts included in written reports eg annual reports
given the unique nature of the work we do our communications are developed internally by the om buds team members themselves
having the team working together on communications both shares the burden and increases the likelihood of quality output
writing abilities vary from person to person however each member of the team has strengths to talent visual ideas sensing what with the company tone and culture
once the content is developed we circulate communications internally to stake holders in human resources legal and internal communications for feedback and help with layout and design
meetings with leaders and employees in person are highly effective in informing people about an om buds services it provides and the principles under which it operates
all members of the om buds team can be effective in such outreach activities
most typically the principal will be the primary presenter to leadership
the om buds frequently deliver employee briefings describing the nature of the om buds office the role of the om buds and how the process works
in addition they provide assurance to potential users of the approachability of the om buds
often there are outreach opportunities where detailed presentation would not be the best approach
these can include open houses charity activities health fairs or town hall meetings
all om buds team members participate in these events provide handouts and answer general the annual reports for and can be found online at

journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
having team means having more resources to deploy and the potential for broader employee outreach
reflection on marketing and education we have found it necessary to develop and share variety of tools to reach out to and inform the company about the om buds office
although in person meetings are most effective in informing people about the om buds office such meetings have been fairly difficult to organize
our employees work in hundreds of facilities across wide geographical expanse in varying shifts and times
given these challenges and the fact that we are small team we have relied on print brochures wallet cards posters annual reports and electronic email news articles and web announcements communications
we have engaged the talent in developing these communications
individual members contributed according to their strengths whether in drafting content preparing artwork or editing final products
using the individual talents of the team enabled us to develop effective and high quality communication materials
in our print and video pieces having variety of voices and faces added to the overall impact of our communications on our audiences
in addition to our internal outreach and education for the company we have extended our outreach outside the company
over the years we have had the opportunity to serve as ambassadors for the om buds function with customers suppliers relevant professional associations and members of communities where the company has physical presence
for instance team members and fellow baker hughes employee in the health safety and environment department coauthored paper exploring potential synergies from an om buds office and social responsibility goals bon ni vier brooke lander lewis
this paper was later presented to forum of professionals some of whom had no prior knowledge of or experience with an om buds at the society of petroleum engineers ep health safety security environmental conference americas held in denver colorado in
we believe our external outreach has created goodwill for the company and bolstered its social responsibility initiatives
whether the participation in external activities involved written communications or actual participation those activities shone positive light on the company as an employer of choice
business planning and team development putting time energy and resources into business planning and team development brings many advantages
it strengthens the individual members of the team by encouraging their growth and development
in addition the team benefits from having the ability to shift work among team members as needed or desired to work more effectively and efficiently
finally the company benefits from having fully enabled team to serve employees who call on us for help
journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
an important ancillary responsibility of practicing om buds is in providing support to the om buds community and promoting the organizational om buds function to other organizations and society at large
having team of varied and specialized roles and skills has allowed us to participate in variety of ways to promote the om buds profession without overwhelming any single member with excessive additional responsibilities
as such all team members contribute to the organizational om buds profession by speaking teaching writing and mentor ing and externally
where possible each team member contributes to the or affiliated organizations such as the corporate organizational ombudsman roundtable or the certified organizational ombudsman practitioner coop program
reflection on business planning and team development each person on the team has grown developed and benefited by participating in business planning and team development opportunities
by sharing knowledge and expertise with other team members each person has become stronger in their role and grown in understanding and support of one another
we have benefitted individually and as team by considering our performance and operations over time
for instance as we have reflected on feedback from our callers we have made adjustments to our protocols
and as we have evaluated those adjustments we have been able to mark improvements in the quality and standards of our service to the company
as is often discussed among our om buds colleagues individual members can experience grief or become overwhelmed due to the nature of the work we do
in addition where team members are contributing to both internal and external efforts they can experience burnout or exhaustion
when our team lost player other team members stepped in to share the added workload
keeping the team engaged inspired and renewed can be challenging
at these times we have been grateful to be able to call on our mentors in the om buds field and fellow om buddies for additional support and good counsel
conclusion we believe that our team approach to an om buds office has empowered us to better fulfill the purpose in rounding out the integrated conflict management system with an independent neutral informal and confidential process ro we williams
since it opened in the om buds office at baker hughes has helped the company surface serious issues and has found ways to provide early warning of them to the company
consistent with other organizational om buds we have guided to internal formal channels any number of whistle blowing issues such as sexual harassment waste fraud andor abuse potential suicidal and homicidal behavior journal of the international ombudsman association ja gn eaux et al
retaliation and wide variety of integrity as described by the december practice report ro we hede en
organizational om buds work in near absolute confidentiality the sop provides eight safeguards to confidentiality and only one an om buds judges situation as presenting an imminent risk of serious harm standard of practice
in such instance and like our colleagues we are able and willing to breach ro we hede en
also consistent with other om buds such breach of confidentiality is rarely required as we are in finding ways to get information where it needs to go without compromising the confidentiality of ro we hede en
options include receiving permission from the caller helping the caller find way to get the information where it needed to go or finding an effective way for compliance office to find the information for itself ro we hede en
staffed with set of specialized roles filled by professionals with varied skill sets and backgrounds we were able to quickly organize and perform valuable services accelerate the credibility integrate into the culture and demonstrate the value the office provides to the company
since the establishment employees have had the option to call on us for confidential help when they have needed it
when they have done so we have guided them through the array of options available to them
our callers have told us that they struggled with issues unsure of what to do and fearful of potential negative consequences for raising concerns
we consistently hear their appreciation to the company for having safe place to talk things out learn of options and prepare their way forward

dear readers in the world of research many individuals utilize auto ethnography as form of exploring concepts and ideas in the broader political social and economic context
auto ethnography allows the researcher to use self reflection as means to explore their own personal experience in relation to these concepts and contexts
it is different from autobiography in that autobiographies only tell the story of the individual without placing it into the larger cultural experience
in this published piece by jan new comb and dawn du quet the authors discuss how the role of om buds changed them through their own lens of experience and as such provide solid examples of reflexive auto ethnography
their stories and how they have chosen to tell them lend insight into the reflective practices that benefit the field as whole as well as provide readers an opportunity to engage with different form of research practice not yet often considered in the om buds literature
this journal welcomes submissions of auto ethnographic those interested in learning more about it might consult the following resources
walnut creek ca left coast press
the ethnographic methodological novel about auto ethnography
auto ethnography personal narrative reflexivity researcher as subject
handbook of qualitative research nd ed

we hope that you enjoy ms new comb and ms reflections and that they serve as guide for readers to become reflexive in their own practice
the editorial board journal of the international ombudsman association new comb du quet introduction many years ago two young women living on opposite sides of the north american continent shared common interest superman stories about someone with extraordinary powers who used his gifts in service to others who stood for justice and courage in the face of daunting challenges
jan new comb and dawn du quet never dreamed they would eventually meet
they got to know each other while serving as board members of the corporate ombudsman association
jan is american dawn is canadian jan is an extrovert dawn is an introvert
they are of different political convictions yet the bond between them is strong
it is based on shared belief in the tremendous advantage of the non adversarial approach desire to continually broaden their perspectives and to learn from each other
above all it is based on mutual respect
the result has been an enduring friendship full of warmth and laughter that has lasted almost years
jan currently uses her ombudsman skills in new role as coach and consultant
dawn continues as an external organizational ombudsman
they recently shared thoughts on their ombudsman experiences and how the role itself can change the practitioner
dawn du quet the office of an ombudsman is safe harbor
simply fair process valuing difference in the many ways it presents
we strive for the restoration of human dignity of personal wellbeing
in often challenging circumstances we look for common ground fair solutions
surely each voyage of dispute resolution leaves its mark on the ombudsman
over time we are subtly changed
humility one of the most meaningful gifts the ombudsman role has given me hope is deeper humility
north american women of my generation were raised with the growth of rights equal opportunity and affirmative action
for many of us in the past one of the ways to gain acceptance in world was to emulate work even dress like work much harder just to be recognized if at all
now we are assertive we challenge the status quo we participate with dignity and self assurance
in what for many still remains an unequal not necessarily an asset
yet as years pass find different kind of humility has developed
the more listen to the situation of others their experience their courage their ideas for change the more know never have all the answers or the life experience
continue to hear innovative journal of the international ombudsman association new comb du quet solutions wish thought of from so many in whose shoes never walk
it is truly lifelong learning process and lessons in humility come from unexpected sources
retirement from large airline in created opportunities for me to expand the work love into different sectors this time as an external organizational ombudsman
quite by chance was introduced to two women from the mohawk reserve near montreal
they invited me to visit and eventually to assist in dispute resolution in their community
it was the beginning of many warm enriching and enlightening friendships that continue to this day
first nations people seem to hold up mirror to nonnatives
realized had developed certain way of being manner of speech vocabulary reflecting the corporate culture of my career
soon learned it was neither appreciated nor helpful in native community their first lesson to me in humility
yet without any loss of respect they freed me to simply be me
they did it by simply being them
it is said that nonnatives tend to ask kind of work do you do
whereas an indigenous person might wonder are you
they wanted to know more about who am as person my values
in the process experienced strong feeling of vulnerability again of humility
the outcome was new and deeper awareness of self
have since come to know the mohawk people and through them myself
as nonnative it is an honor to assist in dispute resolution in an indigenous community
native people say there is reason why we are given two ears and one mouth to listen twice as much as we speak listen with humility in order to understand more deeply ultimately withhold judgment until all have spoken
to great degree is that not what an ombudsman does
so it is with much gratefulness to first nations visitors and friends as well as so many others along the journey that humility continues to accompany assertiveness in the offer of service as an ombudsman
humanity with all our knowledge of the law of policy of corporate and institutional culture it is often our sensitivity to an feelings that brings the greatest comfort to visitors
have learned the best approach is not always the logical one but the more humane one the one that acknowledges feelings their legitimacy and their ownership
one needs to be comfortable with their expression remaining silent while the visitor releases burden of stress often carried for too long
the challenge for the ombudsman to achieve balance between empathy and objectivity
behavior can be influenced by so many different factors including personal health family life etc
to say nothing of the work situation
have learned there is often journal of the international ombudsman association new comb du quet so much more in play than the presenting issue
hopefully my office is an oasis where human feelings can be expressed safely and issues discussed without fear
believe empathy has increased with maturity and objectivity with experience
it is often in listening to visitors that something resonates within me something that encourages an inner journey
have found the role of ombudsman constantly draws me deeper
with this increased awareness of what it is to be human emotional intelligence too has matured
the ability to sense really going on how people feel has been enhanced
my personal comfort level with who am is stronger
have evolved in the ombudsman role
on professional level tap into my own humanity in order to better serve
little thank you note from visitor made me think about the advantages of this capacity in an ombudsman
the visitor was an employee of the police force
her note said you for giving me back the right to my
it was explained to me that view was that emotions are to be left at home as they negatively affect performance
that visitor gave me much food for thought in certain types of work what is the cost of muffling emotions in order to allegedly perform more effectively
what is the best way for us to help the visitor working in such an environment
how do we ourselves preserve our own wellbeing within these unique professions
while am not aware of any existing study on accessing our humanity in our work the experience of other practitioners regarding this issue may be of interest to all
as it turned out the very existence of the office reassured the visitor
in the prevailing workplace culture she expected nonjudgmental empathetic listening
she was even more surprised to be asked her own views on improving the situation
for the first time she said she felt valued
without going into any more detail her thank you note was greatly human level it was more meaningful than anything else may have accomplished to resolve the situation
it spoke to the value of creating safe place of recognizing the legitimacy of feelings of accessing our own humanity in the service of others
human rights as young girl accompanied my dad on visit to the united nations in new york
we entered the magnificent general assembly
asked what all the little boxes were on the arm of every seat
each person can listen to the speaker in their own language
all you have to do is push
could have friends from all over the world and we could all understand each other
journal of the international ombudsman association new comb du quet it was my first exposure to an environment dedicated to the pursuit of world peace and where human rights matter
never forgot how good it felt to be there and how much wanted to be part of it
cross cultural friendships are deeply meaningful for me
they permeate both my personal and professional lives
the ombudsman role has actually enhanced my feeling of belonging to the global community
some visitors have said to me the only place they encounter discrimination is at work
surely in this place where we spend so much of our daily lives we have an expectation of respectful treatment
their greatest asset is the diversity of their workforce and the message needs to come from the top
the ombudsman role has made me more mindful of the possible existence of discrimination as covertly even innocently as it may present itself
it has made me more active in the promotion of respect
use my recommendations to create educational opportunities regarding human rights in the workplace
visitor to my office had the family name ka tch urian
share this story with his permission
he was fed up with colleagues making fun of him by pronouncing his name like sneeze
he wanted something done to stop this lack of respect for his family name
valuing work relationships he want to identify any offenders
he also want anyone to know he had come to the office
we decided together that an awareness session on respect in the workplace could be timely for the whole group
during the session which was very informal in nature mentioned having recently gone to ottawa to hear the dalai lama speak
something he said inspired me languages are sacred all cultures are
slipped this comment into our exchanges
several weeks later mr ka tch urian dropped into my office to say thanks
the demeaning pronunciation of his name had stopped
an ombudsman knows how much these expressions of thanks mean
what the visitor and did was simple
we created deeper awareness of the value of respect
with the help of mr ka tch urian knew we had quietly influenced change
during another awareness session once asked participants does the word mean to would you describe your own
with some awkwardness came soft answer everything my mother taught
there was an audible sigh of appreciation in the room
later learned the respondent was of croatian ancestry
his mother had recently lost her life during the bosnian croatian conflict
every day we arrive at work with so much more than our professional skill
we are accompanied by silent companions wherever we go our race language culture spirituality political beliefs sexual orientation education health relationships joys and sorrows
if diversity is truly the norm in an organization it will reflect the diversity of the population it serves and from which it journal of the international ombudsman association new comb du quet ultimately hires qualified people
human rights in the workplace really means respect and ideally all that flows from it into all aspects of organizational life
the awareness sessions led served to highlight differences in the life experience skills and ideas of workplace colleagues
we talked about the nature of discrimination shared experiences many had lived
we exchanged thoughts on how to promote greater respect
as each session progressed deeper appreciation of each other seemed to develop
we gradually entered an oasis of common shared desire to be valued simply for who we are and for all we can offer in short to be respected
as ombudsman facilitating these gatherings was so rewarding on human level
inspired by diversity and difference came away enriched every time
as an external organizational ombudsman have also become much more aware of human rights issues regarding first nations
indigenous communities may be in the minority in north america yet despite the traumatic effects of colonization they have continued to survive
they were here in north america long before our ancestors
they teach us to be mindful of history their unique place in it and our own as descendants of newcomers
the mohawk community has shared with me the primary importance of land of preserving language culture and values the most profound of which is respect
they have shown me the benefits of restorative justice over punishment
have learned that the philosophy of restoring what has been lost including respect encourages learning experience for the offender without diminishing their value as continuing member of the community
by creating an opportunity to make amends in mutually acceptable way offenders themselves are treated with respect
what healing humane approach to conflict resolution
it has become part of my philosophy as an ombudsman
diversity and its natural companion inclusiveness are joy for me
they not only increase our awareness of the importance of human rights but also of the need to rid ourselves of old stereotypes
they help us understand the great value of mutual respect respect for our organizations our communities our country and among nations
in his inspiring book former secretary general of the un dag reflects hunger of mine can be satisfied for the simple reason that the nature of life is such that can realize my individuality by becoming bridge for
upon reflection believe this is who wished to be who hope am still becoming
in looking back over this journey as an ombudsman and how it has changed me think about all those many inspirational and now absent mentors
in later years wish could have thanked my father for his insight in visiting the un
was able indirectly to journal of the international ombudsman association new comb du quet acknowledge dag through his nephew knut who happened to be director general of the international air transport association ia ta while worked there
in meaningful conversation one day we shared our common admiration for his devotion to world peace through respectful dialogue
managed to express appreciation indirectly to harper lee for her inspiring story of social justice in to kill mockingbird and directly to gregory peck for his moving portrayal of the southern lawyer
he happened to host conversation with gregory in montreal number of years ago
in answer to my question regarding harper lee he said they were still in touch and had remained friends
after we had spoken for few minutes asked him if could give him hug
warm memory of good man who portrayed another good man inspiring so many including me
continue to thank the mohawk community for their welcoming way for their patience in educating me regarding the other side of history we were never taught in school for the opportunity to work together in challenging situations and for many warm friendships that continue to this day
most of all thank all those visitors to my office for their trust and often for their great courage in coming forward to be of service to others
it is you who have been the greatest source of change in me
lifetime of others still to jan new comb had just graduated from law school after four years of night classes while still working full time
corporate america was trying to provide equal opportunities for women and was looking forward to my last assignment prior to capturing an early retirement
the vice president who hired me indicated that he wanted diversity and balanced approach in the office
the two of us became the first ombudsman team in our person division and the second in our very large international corporation
always concerned about abuse of power and protection of tended to be bit of champion for anyone perceived as the underdog
thank goodness had also obtained mediation training because soon experienced that there is so much more to resolving conflict than considering legal rights
as listened to people and the stories that found their way to my door common theme emerged rather than potential violations nearly all situations presented serious communication breakdown and the unpleasant or confusing feelings associated with it
sometimes there had been no communication at all with the person or about the policy the visitor was concerned about
sometimes communication had been attempted but was not effective and serious misunderstandings had developed
in the most journal of the international ombudsman association new comb du quet difficult cases there had been deceitful andor disrespectful communication on one or both sides
one thing became obvious different personalities see the world differently
the ben zig er thinking styles assessment bt sa helps explain this frontal right thinkers are sensitive to abstract patterns and experience the world using dynamic mental process characterized by visual imagination
they connect seemingly unrelated input to form big picture in their minds attending to detail only if necessary
they are creative in their approach to problem solving looking for integrative solutions to satisfy the interests of all stake holders
frontal left thinkers are very logical analytical and goal oriented
facts not feelings are their focus
power hierarchy and authority are important to them
when faced with conflict they want to win
basal left thinkers follow rules and established procedures needing details to be able to build and understand the big picture in their minds
problem solving for them is often grounded in consulting existing policy or asking how others have done something before
basal right thinkers value harmony and are very sensitive to feelings and vocal tone
they will tend to avoid conflict when they can or try to make people happy if they
we all have one natural thinking style preference with additional competency development in varying amounts in the other three thinking styles
fortunately having significant development in three of these four thinking styles was able to act as an effective translator as looked for the common ground upon which to fashion mutually acceptable solutions
often would have an intuitive about what was actually going on
this hunch is hard to explain because just intuitive initial impression formed by absorbing all available like words body language tone of voice place in the organizational hierarchy and energy levels
my hunch the what was often right but the reason the why was sometimes based on my own experiences and opinions
this awareness helped me change my approach
learned to develop the patience to hold hunch in temporary space suspending judgment until in depth information gathering was accomplished
hunch or theory is just thoroughly explored and tested
many times the initial expressed concern turned out to be tip of the
as practiced remaining neutral and listening to all sides to discern each perception as well as what might also be factually true underlying interests feelings and concerns were revealed
it is amazing how each past experience in addition to thinking journal of the international ombudsman association new comb du quet style also colors perceptions of each may see and hear the same thing but may interpret it very differently
although my legal training was helpful in assessing possible risks to the corporation mediation skills were far more valuable in developing options to consider and resolving situations in mutually acceptable manner
the best resolutions were often achieved by hosting both sides at my round table to explore the issues and hear the underlying interests at play working together in real time to find solution
when this possible because people refused to meet or were in different geographical locations became good option
it often took more time but did protect the visitor from the potential discomfort of facing someone they perceived as an adversary
however in peer to peer situations especially when people have to continue working together avoidance as useful
resolution is always the preferred outcome but sometimes the best that can be achieved is respectful
being natural problem solver changed by learning to accept that fix everything and sometimes is not required
lacking an acceptable outcome helped visitors explore other options
sometimes just helping visitor come to terms with understanding and accepting the situation was sufficient
still remember one of these stories vividly after all these years
the young man was being laid off and had pregnant wife and two young children to support
he felt the decision had been made unfairly and was concerned about his ability to support his family
after thorough investigation and eventually meeting with the vice president of manufacturing had to gently deliver the news that his layoff would not be reversed
when he understood that everyone would eventually be laid off because the long term plans involved closing our division he realized that in tough job market he would actually have better chance to find another job before hundreds or thousands more unemployed workers hit the streets
few days later he walked into my office with huge bouquet of flowers
told him understand the gesture because able to save his job
he said he felt that had done everything could possibly have done on his behalf and he appreciated knowing that had gone to bat for him
the happy ending came when he found that new job in florida moved his family there and received christmas card letting me know that all was well
this was one of many intrinsically gratifying experiences as an ombudsman
in fact often said it was job would do for free if could afford to
sincerely believe learned and benefitted immensely from the privilege of functioning in this role as much or even more than the people served
it became continual process of staying open to unpredictable possibilities and refining my skills
journal of the international ombudsman association new comb du quet so what were the biggest personal changes or lessons learned for me
came to realize how important the skill of really is to effective conflict to what is said and how it is said in addition to what may not be said but can be observed intuitively by paying attention to tone or body language providing clues to need for further exploration
came to appreciate that attending to feelings is very often more important than facts or legalities
gained greater understanding about why laws and legal systems are often so challenged to fashion real resolutions
effectively meeting the needs of both parties in dispute is not possible in an adversarial system where there is and
also lawyers and judges tend to focus on facts and laws rather than feelings or mutually acceptable creative solutions
however there are some situations where mutual resolution cannot be crafted and decision is required
things such as imminent threats of violence clear sexual harassment vs
misunderstandings or other serious legal issues may require additional action
in these situations would report imminent threats of violence coach visitors about accessing the formal system or make recommendations to management for organizational or policy changes
many years later continue to benefit from all of these experiences
am no longer officially an ombudsman but still use effective communication and mediation skills as coach consultant helping people and organizations find elegant solutions to their concerns
after all listening and searching for common ground go long way toward understanding and problem solving in most any circumstance
conclusion reflecting on our unique experiences remarkable number of common themes emerged from two very different practitioners respect for people perspectives and perceptions
new and deeper awareness of self and our own assumptions and biases
the importance of listening and the patience to fully explore an issue beyond the initially expressed concern
acknowledging and honoring feelings as well as facts laws and policies
the ability to act as translator or bridge between people searching for common ground to aid in fashioning resolution
and perhaps most significant continuing to develop an attitude of service curiosity and openness to learning while providing safe space for visitors to explore their concerns
these common themes helped us grow in the ombudsman role and continue to nourish long enjoyable and enduring friendship

journal of the international ombudsman association blair
introduction was honored to be invited to deliver the mary ro we honorary keynote address at the annual conference of the international ombudsman association
was also to combine my training my experience and my perspective into some coherent statement of my ideas about our profession while keeping true to the goal whereby keynote address will critique an area in the om buds profession that warrants discussion debate and
wanted to create statement that would be both engaging and helpful and that would lead to future discussions
after lot of self doubt and reflection settled on the theme of the role of the organizational
to say was surprised by the response to the keynote would be an understatement
it was more gratifying than could have predicted
my perspective and experiences resonated with many other om buds who embraced my ideas
others believed had stretched the role of an om buds too far
some found my ideas disconcerting or contrary to standards of practice sop position reject
still others had visceral reaction and worried it would create dangerous in the profession because my views were simply too radical and risky to implement in their institutions
taken together the various positive and negative reactions told me my goal of provoking introspection and discussion had been met
what follows is not transcript of my address
instead it is refashioning that hope will be useful whether or not someone reading this was present to hear my remarks
first briefly discuss the case used as an example in the keynote
then share my personal experience of being an om buds as it has shaped my current ideas about the role
next provide more detailed explanation of how our om buds office approached the case in question
finally explore the difference between being transactional leader and transformational leader and its relevance to the om buds role
as way of introducing my ideas let me offer brief overview of the case presented in the keynote
it involved widespread and decades old problems with staff in large unit on our campus
first level supervisors and departmental leadership were responsible for sexual harassment sexual assault and extortion
those who were the survivors and victims were vulnerable on number of counts and were initially and understandably unwilling to speak to anyone in authority about the situation
ultimately these practices were revealed stopped and those responsible were held accountable
wondered if the sensational facts of the case and its feel good conclusion might distract from my larger message but used this case because it served as practical example that emphasized many of the ideas wanted to share in re imagining our roles as organizational om buds
it was framework illustrating how wanted to shift the approach to the work that we do
journal of the international ombudsman association blair colleague remarked after the keynote case helped me realize how important and meaningful my work can truly be
for the first time it really made me feel good about being part of this
that is certainly heartwarming statement but it unfortunately confirmed my concern that the underlying factors that guided the om buds decisions and actions towards the conclusion and resolution had likely been overlooked
what wanted to convey most was that our office had shifted the paradigm in our practice from transactional to transformational and in the process embraced our roles as transformational leaders in our organization
subsequent post keynote conversations convinced me that not everyone fully understood the efforts that went into the resolution of the case
these efforts included the patient gathering of information through one on one and group meetings the careful analysis of trends and patterns the thoughtful development of goals and action plans and their strategic implementation and the collaboration between victims allies administrators and other decision makers
the om buds office often guided these efforts from behind the scenes unknown to many involved
we were able to help bring about this change by developing systematic approach of working with groups and individuals to manage their particular situation through focused training sessions
these gave victims and their allies the tools to resist and the confidence to hope
we educated people on how best to utilize formal and informal processes
working with decision makers we shared information about the shortfall of relevant policies and procedures and suggested appropriate changes
we facilitated meetings with key administrators while gently urging them to collaborate and problem solve as the complexity and scope of the issue unfolded
in addition we strategically placed the institution on notice through series of carefully orchestrated steps
all of these actions and many more in concert brought about much needed change for the individuals involved the department the institution and the organizational culture
everyone can agree that change is certainty for individual om buds
we can control some changes others we cannot control
what matters is how we respond to change
rigid and static interpretation of our guiding principles may prevent us from making truly meaningful contribution to our organizations may erect unnecessary barriers to assisting people who come to us for help and may limit our satisfaction in our work
any of these results will have significant consequences for the profession
change is also certainty for our profession
as write has an ethics and professional standards task force in place that review and propose to the board updates to standards of practice sop and code of ethics coe to assure that they are consistent with legal and professional development bylaws and member the international ombudsman association
om buds must grapple with change to remain relevant
let me now turn to explaining what led me to become an om buds who seeks to be transformational leader
by that mean someone who works to bring about meaningful change
journal of the international ombudsman association blair my personal experience about fourteen years ago several people encouraged me to apply for the newly created position of associate university om buds officer at columbia university
they told me that would be good at it and taking the position would be good fit for me and for the university
one mentor said would be particularly effective in the role because possessed the ability to relate well to people at all levels in the institution and had excellent problem solving skills and crisis management experience
honestly did not know whether this was true
had little appreciation for what the position of om buds entailed how the office functioned and its place in the culture and structure of the university
went ahead and applied and marsha wagner took chance and brought me into the profession
had wonderful teacher in marsha wagner and will always be grateful to her and other role models in the profession
became certified mediator participated in training courses through the ombudsman association and later and took advantage of many opportunities to learn informally from more experienced om buds
embraced the profession and committed to practicing according to the standards and principles
at the same time began to have private doubts
the more met with people who came to me for help the more listened and offered options to help them untangle complicated situations and develop strategies for next steps the more interacted with the formal leaders of the organization the more began to feel some uneasiness about how we practiced
conversations with practicing om buds throughout the years lead me to believe that most if not all om buds at some point struggle with staying neutral but my doubts were even more fundamental
at first thought perhaps it was the result of the to be expected divide between the theoretical taught in training sessions and the practical application of my new skills
wondered how much my personal style natural tendencies and experiences contributed to my uncertainty
expected at some point soon to reconcile these tensions and find comfortable sense of or balance if you will in my work
alas such was not the case
soon realized that as an om buds saw the organization with greater clarity but in different light than when was an employee in other capacities
it was as if someone had cleaned the grimy lens of pair of much needed glasses
was now privy to sensitive information acquired from confidential conversations
now had broader and deeper knowledge of an organizational culture that at times rewarded poor behavior and at times penalized those making positive contribution
it was easy to go along and avoid difficult conversations and decisions
bureaucratic snafus and inconsistent implementation of policies and practices often created perception of an uncaring institution in which unfair outcomes were readily journal of the international ombudsman association blair tolerated
of course also knew of many wonderful achievements done by wonderful people but as om buds we hear much more negative than positive information
all of this became challenge for me and felt trapped in position of inactivity for fear of making mistake and violating our sop and coe
did not want to become jaded and cynical and allow that perspective to prevent me from developing options and far reaching solutions while managing the urge to right what saw as wrong
increasingly felt that the work was doing was little more than an effort in futility true professional dilemma
heard complicated issues with profound implications for the organization
dutifully provided to the appropriate decision makers with suggestions for addressing the concerns
often they listened politely and did nothing whether from inertia disagreement fear or some other reason that was not explained
this way of passing on information is the embodiment of transactional role
it is bureaucratic benign and in the longrun less effective than is desirable
om buds rarely encounter simple problems with simple solutions
whenever an issue affects an individual or group it has an impact on the organization as well
om buds are in unique position and have special opportunity to make connections and see the implications for all concerned
we have the information to do trend analysis and find patterns where others might not
in many ways this is threat and risk assessment
imagine the single pebble that rolls down the side of hill that creates rock slide that results in an avalanche that does significant damage to the hill or even destroys it
making connections and understanding consequences from our unique vantage point is form of risk assessment that should be integral to our work
interestingly whenever have asked om buds if they do risk assessment most say they do not
however if we de construct the process into gathering data and information analyzing the trends and patterns that become evident and seeing the likely consequences we see we do engage in form of risk assessment
it is practice we need to integrate into our work with individuals groups of people who come to us for help and on the organizational level
it is taking the next step of deciding how when where why and with whom we share what we have learned that some om buds apparently find disconcerting or even inappropriate
developing goals objectives and action plans carefully structured to address specific problems and concerns in the organization may be difficult but it must be done if we are to be truly successful as om buds
this part of our work has the greatest potential for helping other leaders make transformative changes
the sop and coe offer little guidance for this aspect of our work
they tell us what we should and should not do but not how to do it
in professional development the university of north carolina at chapel hill may have the only om buds program that invites people to share good news with us
we also invite suggestions about how to improve carolina
this is stated in our brochure and we routinely include it in presentations
journal of the international ombudsman association blair courses greater attention is paid to what we should or cannot do with less focus on how to do what we appropriately want to do
it is not uncommon for some participants to leave foundational course with wealth of information great experience and with new friends and contacts but without sufficient useful practical information
some seem nearly paralyzed when faced with circumstances they have not encountered or heard discussed
fear of making mistake may lead to indecisiveness
know because been there myself wondering whether avoiding some issues would make me irrelevant and unable to make the impact had hoped to make
this hesitation to move forward on systemic issues was contrary to my natural instincts and left me uncomfortable
would have benefitted from more direction from and other om buds
know some other om buds have had the same experience know because now many of these om buds contact me to talk about their frustrations and fears
while struggling with these professional dilemmas moved to north carolina in to develop and launch the university om buds office at the university of north carolina at chapel hill
was determined to create an office that approached our work in way that took these concerns into account
not long after arrived worked on case that was perfect opportunity to do so
it challenged me to think about our work differently
learned that department on campus had common practice where some managers offered temporary and permanent positions to women in exchange for sex and to both men and women in exchange for money
sadly the practice was generations old
the habits that helped sustain this behavior over time became part of the organizational culture in this one unit and became accepted as the way it is
most people felt nothing could be done and resistance was pointless because previous attempts to address the matter had been ruthlessly suppressed
people needed their jobs and had legitimate fear of losing them or of suffering some other form of retribution if they spoke up
nothing about bringing an end to these practices happened quickly
it took time before individuals in the department would speak openly and honestly to me
it took time to collect their experiences and the effect they had on each person
needed to show my empathy and sorrow as well as my assurance that something could be done
it took time to understand the people history and culture of the concerns and interests
they learned to trust me because spoke language they could understand and appreciate
to be clear this was not language based on different ethnic and cultural groups but it was language that fostered cross cultural communication
it is the universal language of empathy honesty and humanity
it also took time to learn the diverse perspectives of people outside the department who shared responsibility for what happened
it took time to develop trust across the journal of the international ombudsman association blair university community so would be listened to
it took time to connect the dots to see how some seemingly unrelated issues were all relevant and to plan strategy for how and when to involve others
after significant period of time gathering information identified the goals and considered where they overlapped with the goals and where there was space between them
it took lot of strategic thinking and planning to move forward
worked hard to foster collaboration between those who had been wronged their allies and those who had the authority to initiate and oversee change
the outcome most of which became public was beneficial to everyone involved with the exception of those who lost their jobs because their wrongdoing had been exposed
this outcome was transformational in many ways
first significant set of employees was no longer subject to the unacceptable and likely illegal actions of their supervisors
these beleaguered employees could come to work without fear of being subject to the demands and whims of their supervisors
changes in structure and policy as well as in personnel were implemented
formal support systems were put in place
administrators were praised for the direct way they dealt with the problem
the om buds office was praised for bringing the problem to light and for offering options for responding
our perspective was actively promoted and sought
particularly when oversight groups struggled with dichotomy between which was often policy and procedurally driven and the right which was human rights and justice driven
second many people across the campus became aware of the om buds office and the important role it filled on campus
conversations and consultations by decision makers and those who felt powerless concluded that we could be trusted and that we could help get things done
the office strengthened its already positive relationships with the human resources professionals and the attorneys representing the university
the case solidified my belief that more active and participatory om buds program was more meaningful for individuals who came to us for help and for the organization
essentially embraced an activist om buds philosophy gad lin
the om buds office evolved from transactional way of doing business and embraced more transformational leadership role
we were intentional and strategic in managing this change
significant change occurred transformational change occurred and applaud the former chancellor who not only supported but insisted on change once he understood the scope of the problem
starting with one person who came to me for help with different matter was able to encourage and ultimately convince many others to come talk with me
had to reassure them over and over that the om buds office was safe place and that we kept our word with regard to confidentiality
this case occurred before the title ix letter to colleagues
we are not currently title ix who are obligated to report allegations of sexual harassment and assault
if we had been this case could not have unfolded as it did
it would have ended when explained our confidentiality and reporting requirements to the first visitor
journal of the international ombudsman association blair it is easy to attribute our success to the egregious facts in this case but that conclusion misses my point
did not select it because of its sensational nature or because many details were already public
rather this case elegantly illustrates my message that there is role for the om buds beyond the transactional
it demonstrates that as om buds we can use these same strategies and opportunities for positive change even when the situation is one that does not cause jaws to drop
willingness to act may require re imagining the role of the om buds and commitment to professional self awareness and growth
individual om buds and the profession as whole are always maturing and evolving in response to new knowledge changing work environments external events we do not control our own developing abilities and application of ethical standards in cases of first impression
sticking my nose in and sticking my neck out took me into unchartered territory and admit did lot of risk assessment for the om buds office before moving forward
it paid off in the results for the department in better alignment between university values and policies and its practices and in new respect and increased stature for the om buds office
our work was recognized and our reputation enhanced across campus
the office was publicly praised for its role in this situation
think was if om buds truly mean it when we say we believe in and can advocate for
am not confident fully understand what this means since fairness is in the eyes of the beholder
unlike in most situations had specific outcomes in mind to eradicate these practices and if possible to hold wrongdoers accountable
thought fairness demanded both of these
the om buds office navigated this process without compromising the spirit of the sop and coe
however we were not shy about sharing our views thoughts and opinions
final decisions were not ours but by design we intentionally influenced many of the outcomes
do have any conclusions from this experience that might be useful to other om buds
certainly hope so learn all you can learn
learn from visitors from what they say and say and from their nonverbal cues
learn by listening and watching when leaders and those whom they lead speak
learn the history of your organization and its values and traditions
look for gaps between espoused values and actual practices
consider the lawsuits filed by accuser and accused in title ix sexual misconduct cases about the fairness of process adopted by college or university after review by attorneys and input from experts
see for sex assault young men are filing more lawsuits to clear their the washington post april
washington post com local education expelled for sex assault young men are filing more lawsuits to ce ar their names
journal of the international ombudsman association blair never compromise your integrity or fundamental operating principles
one instance of doing so can destroy your credibility
choosing not to act when you see clear need to act will diminish you in your own eyes and if known in the eyes of others who believe in fair treatment for all members of your community
get to know others at all levels of your organization
believe it is acceptable to eat lunch or have coffee with others who are part of the community
believe it is acceptable to serve as consultant not member to committees or task forces when asked and if you believe you can be useful
your office can develop allies and partners who can support you
let others make decisions but help them by providing reliable information and the unique perspective that an om buds has
going from transactional to transformative serves your institution and your visitors
now wish to share some observations about how we as om buds practice
please note that my observations do not apply to all om buds or to any om buds at all times
the transactional om buds we too often approach our work from position of feeling inadequate isolated and powerless
at times we think we do not deserve place at the table
believe these feelings stem primarily from two sources first our confidentiality which is an essential part of our value limits us
om buds are unable to tell anyone the details of our work
we can make only vague statements of our contributions to the wellbeing of visitors and our organizations
we cannot prove it was our efforts that averted grievance lawsuit withdrawal from school bad publicity losing valued employee or some other negative result
we cannot disclose when our ideas have improved policies or when they have made sure funds were managed properly
we cannot calculate the intangible benefits of making our institutions better places
second om buds are too often professionally insecure
many people in our organizations do not understand our work or appreciate our roles
they may assume we are duplicating the work of others or are trying to invade their turf
we have to explain ourselves over and over
many of us do not have meaningful job security we have all seen om buds offices dismantled or kept open with reduced responsibilities and resources
we are underpaid in many instances and have few opportunities to move to new positions
we envy the benefits of other professions most notably the privilege held by lawyers
our insecurity results in our not being our own best advocates
we want to be something we are not
we fixate on the need to have legal privilege
while this is very important we expend journal of the international ombudsman association blair great deal of energy and effort trying to persuade the appropriate decision makers in our organizations to allow us this benefit
however clumsy attempts to secure for om buds have backfired because of our confusion between privilege and confidentiality
some in our organizations view us as and overreaching when the fact remains that om buds in the united states simply do not have privilege because it has not been granted by any court or legislature here
in our efforts to advocate for legal privilege in our organizations we fail to appreciate the uniqueness of our roles and its potential for innovation and progressiveness
the concept hope we will all discuss is that of the om buds gad lin
by that mean we need to do more than be reactive or stay in our comfort zone
of course we must work with the visitors who seek us out but we must not give in to the temptation to isolate ourselves in our offices
it is far too easy and safe to do so
to be honest for many of us this suits our personal inclinations
this is the part of our work in which we have more control and we see an immediate impact on the individual who came to us for help
we must guard against self imposed mar gi na liz ati on as we mute our voices even when we have something to say
we run the risk of becoming irrelevant if we avoid engaging with the organization on larger comprehensive level
throughout the years interactions with colleagues in the profession have helped me to realize that most of us are modest people which is usually good quality but it can prevent speaking out in ways that draw appropriate attention to ourselves
we must engage on macro level
if we do our impact will be more significant appreciation for our work will increase and we may well find new professional satisfaction
we serve the organization when we assist individuals and we serve individuals when we assist the organization
we must become better advocates for ourselves and our profession
we have valuable role to play in our organizations and are in special position to improve them
even when an om buds program has been created as quick fix after some specific problem or embarrassment the om buds has an opportunity to prove their worth
the leadership of the om buds in transformational change dispute resolution and conflict management are essential elements of our identity and practice
our identity and practice can also include transformational leadership if we are willing to include it
om buds may need to take more active and more assertive participatory role in our organizations
in short we may need to become activist om buds
rigid interpretations of the sop may restrict om buds from taking on the responsibilities of an activist om buds
the purist perspective which is one valid way to conceive of our role held by some om buds reinforces this limitation
to some it may seem that om buds cannot appropriately engage in activities not explicitly approved in the sop
to others holding another valid perspective the sop allow plenty of room for the use of good journal of the international ombudsman association blair judgment in setting boundaries in the ways we deal with the realities of the organizations in which we practice
no one wants to commit or appear to commit any form of om buds
but always playing it safe reduces the possibilities for making the maximum contributions to organizations and visitors alike
if we stand silent when we see troubling policies or practices that persist because of avoidance by senior leadership we miss significant opportunities to be catalyst for positive change
in my view the sop allow for direct action in many circumstances
our informality allows us great deal of flexibility in helping people help themselves and in helping the organization
we can say and do things that those who oversee and implement formal processes cannot
our flexibility is enhanced by being off the record and not serving as an office of notice
in some cases informal and formal processes can complement each other and even collaborate to respond to dispute
some om buds step out as soon as someone who comes to us for help initiates formal process
prefer to make that decision on case by case basis
although not in the sop or coe om buds are taught that we can move information and concerns to decision makers through
we can do so either with permission from visitor or if we can devise way to protect the identity while passing along our thoughts
for example many times suggestion that department review the policy on conflict of interest or alcohol use does not indicate why the suggestion is being made or call to the auditor to suggest that particular unit be moved up on the priority list for auditing does not reveal to anyone who brought information to the om buds
the term is insufficient to describe the range of what om buds can and sometimes should do
suggest an audience of one or small group
it implies that om buds do not engage with all levels of the organization
an om buds needs to engage variety of people at all levels over time even if they do not come directly to us for help or advice
seems passive suggesting response given by someone who has received information or observed some action
yes but the om buds can do more than merely pass on information to someone else
we can collect analyze and interpret what we are told and what we observe from our unique vantage point
no one else in the organization has access to the same information
it is not enough for an om buds to provide information and then step back and observe decisions makers from afar when we may well have useful ideas about how to respond to the information we provide
we will often have to be part of ongoing conversations in order to advance transformational change
we can help others develop goals objectives and action plans to manage change
we need to take full advantage of our role
still decision makers may choose to do nothing even with the information
we need to ask ourselves what is our responsibility to the organization at that point
until membership categories were dependent on practicing according to the sop and even now only those om buds who do are eligible to become certified
journal of the international ombudsman association blair organizational om buds routinely say we have no power
while technically true the message others hear is that the om buds has good intentions but is actually irrelevant and inconsequential when it comes to actually having an impact
however strong om buds has plenty of influence which is form of referent power french raven
if we have built relationships established mutual trust and contributed to thoughtful conversations with those who hold power then our ideas will be sought and given meaningful consideration
yes it is complicated to use influence and stay neutral but it is possible if we are careful and explain why we say what we say
encourage you not to tiptoe or run in the opposite direction when we see opportunities or when we are invited to give our perspective and yes to use our influence
trip to south africa for as part of five member instructor team of organizational om buds truly deepened my appreciation of the value of influence and affirmed my belief that om buds can be transformational leaders
the south african government has mandated all public colleges and universities to implement om buds programs similar to one that was operating at the university of cape town
was invited to provide training for those taking on the om buds role role that was new to them and to their institutions
participants in the class included individuals from other organizations and sectors ranging from the military to municipality and community programs
it is important to note that the post apartheid south african constitution is regarded as one of the most progressive in the world
mention this because noted how frequently class participants kept using the word
at the social event the night before class began one man said to me am looking forward to learning some transformational
learned that transformation is constitutionally mandated for public institutions
on the first day of training we explained the four principles of the organizational om buds profession
the consensus of the class was that the role as we described it was too passive for the needs of post apartheid south africa
we heard that informality and that we were merely with instead of possessing or using it for the greater good
people wondered how an om buds could contribute to much needed change in south africa if we were not more active in leading or at least participating in it
in response our team revised the curriculum we would have lost the group had we not
we addressed their concerns by acknowledging them and respected them by not taking defensive position or tone
we openly discussed the concerns clarified points where necessary and pushed back when appropriate
it was only after we explained the flexibility we have and the range of actions we can take because of our informality that participants began to understand the value of an organizational om buds
this experience in south africa helped me realize that organizational om buds have the potential to become transformational leaders in our organizations
we can use our influence to promote fairness and help organizations align their policies and practices with their stated values
hope we will use our skills at trend analysis and development journal of the international ombudsman association blair of goals and action plans and then continue to be available to those responsible for decisions and those affected by them
if we do we will improve our organizations enhance respect for the om buds role create additional opportunities and increase our own personal job satisfaction
conclusion ours is young profession that is still in an early developmental stage
we will always be evolving and adapting as people issues cultural norms and environments change
we can approach this reality with fear or with confidence
if we do not actively engage with the tough issues in our organizations we risk decline in the understanding of and support for our work as well as professional life that is very likely less satisfying than it could be
am pleased that is reexamining our sop
we must ask whether they impede the growth and development of our profession whether they strain professional relationships whether they contribute to unnecessary tensions in the and most importantly whether they stand in the way of more fully realized profession
we must move beyond the rigid interpretation of our sop and coe and dispel the many mis perceptions about how we should or should not practice
it contributes to our limiting ourselves
the organizational om buds profession needs to incorporate more progressive proactive and assertive way of doing its work by embracing the role of transformational leadership
this approach entails the thoughtful and deliberate shift in the profession from transactional way of doing business to transformational leadership role
transformation is more practical and meaningful for the individuals who come to us for help for the organization we serve and for ourselves
responsibility goes hand in hand with opportunities for leadership
we enjoy level of independence and autonomy that most in our organizations do not have
we must hold ourselves accountable every day for our work
transformative leadership without personal accountability is unhealthy and potentially harmful
we must always be honest with ourselves and question the rationale for our choices
if we are not satisfied with even proud of that rationale then we must rethink our choices
every om buds has the opportunity to shape their role and stay open to new opportunities
my message here can be distilled to encouraging you to embrace and enjoy that freedom and to use it responsibly

journal of the international ombudsman association burton
introduction looking back at the history of om buds practice in the united states and beyond many of these offices arose in times when protest incivility and questions about rights permeated daily conversations
today is no different save one piece
in the and establishment of om buds offices emerged as part of larger trend to create channels by which authority could be questioned
seen as an important mechanism for giving voice to those without power or with less power than authorities and leaders the trend included giving protections for those who raised issues or dissented so that they could exercise those rights without or with less risk punishment or retribution
while this trend enhanced the right to dissent or disagree it included the belief that disagreements were legitimate and could be resolved by taking into account the different perspectives and interests of the disputants
at the same time there existed general agreement that in many situations individuals could agree on or could establish shared understanding about events or issues in dispute and that many matters could be addressed by moving away from seeing relationships and conflicts from win lose orientation
the difference from the initial days of om buds practice to today appears to be movement away from dialogue and deliberation
questions have emerged as to what space an om buds can occupy in the current conversations around the political climate and civil discourse
given the standards of practice neutral space seems natural for om buds when conflict arises
however neutrality also calls for us to refrain from siding with one side or another
what happens if the conflict is between those who argue for civil discourse and those who do not want civil discourse or if civil discourse is rejected by both sides
yet it is that same call to resolve conflict and ease tensions that urges om buds to find space within the conversation and provide opportunities for individuals to come together
in addition it is often calls for justice fairness and equity that keep om buds so engaged in their work
these calls can seem to conflict with the goal of neutrality
however neutrality does not prohibit one from having an opinion about the issues at hand
for that reason om buds may be best situated to build this space
planned happenstance happenstance learning theory the standards of practice as outlined by the international ombudsman association have afforded om buds planned happenstance in the development of the field
term coined by describes the concept whereby career has been designed in such way that when an opportunity presents itself one may fully take advantage of it
the era that the om buds community now finds itself in appears as one of in that the many years that om buds have encouraged civil discourse in organizations attended to neutrality and journal of the international ombudsman association burton informality and attended to biases have given the field cause to hone skills required for repairing the current fractures in society
within planned happenstance theory environmental conditions and events play vital role in the ways one divines career and profession
zimb ar do stated that power of the environment can greatly control human behavior
present times have created just such space where the environment can greatly control the ways in which the om buds profession further defines itself and assists others in defining their own actions within their organizations
this time provides an opportunity for the profession to further assist others in understanding civil discourse and conflict resolution and moment for om buds to further define the profession and communicate its value to others across the globe
within happenstance learning theory individuals take action to better prepare for events that change their circumstances
in this day it seems that many om buds fear what changes in administrations and in the overall political climate mean especially as it relates to their role how it might affect them rather than how they might see it as space to further define roles within organizations
this concern needs to be framed in terms of the climate being an opportunity for the field
second om buds as professional body need to identify initial concerns in order to better position the field for opportunity an aim of this article
third they can use successful past experiences with unplanned events as basis for current actions
there exists history wherein om buds practitioners have dealt with the unknown and shifts in organizational structure and leadership and assisted others in best understanding these shifts
fourth om buds can recognize potential opportunities
opportunities do not come without certain level of risk
however to recognize this era as an opportunity for the field to better define itself and an opportunity for the field to act on its standards of practice in providing space for others to address concerns remains key
finally om buds can overcome any blocks to action that they may have
for example some om buds may believe that the standards of practice hinder the ability to act as agents of justice rather than enhance the ability to do so
to assist om buds practitioners in planning for the happenstance provided by the current era this article outlines several areas for om buds to consider in an effort to further define the field and help others to better understand it as well as work to address the fractures in the global society
these areas center on two themes the om buds experience and om buds practice the om buds experience
fear and anxiety journal of the international ombudsman association burton om buds practice
large group conversations the om buds experience identity much of what happens in this new era may conflict with or confirm the beliefs of the individual om buds
how does one account for this in their practice without displaying personal bias in their words or actions
the honest truth exists that an om buds can never be wholly unbiased when it comes to their identity and personal views
for example the field recognizes gender and race as factors of which an om buds needs to be aware and self conscious
the same could be said of political perspectives
the key is to recognize that bias and learn to create strategies to recognize it and attend to it when working with visitor or administrator with an opposing view as well as recognize the perspective of differentiating between the individual and the office itself
being an om buds might place some constraints on political involvement and create more caution about involvement as private citizen but as private citizens om buds practitioners may be unwilling to limit their involvement in politics entirely
one just needs to attend to their identity and bias when working with visitors
while many resources on bias center on racial and gender biases these strategies and theories could be extrapolated for working with political bias in this era as well

fear anxiety while om buds look for fairness within systems in this new era one may indeed become targets when providing resources and supports to individuals who increasingly feel that their voices have not been heard
whether these threats come from budgetary constraints or from other venues media backlash complaints about the om buds office itself etc
om buds have historically had the charge to speak out when processes and systems appear unfair
to deny that as role within the field acts contrary to the very values of neutrality and independence that the field holds dear
while the work of the om buds might face few more barriers om buds also know how systems work and can find hope in that
while om buds do not advocate for visitors we can certainly advocate for ethical and responsible systems and leadership for all constituents within society
it correlates with the role of reporting systemic trends and issues upwards within the organization especially as it relates to concerns relative to recognition of social political economic and cultural factors
when om buds become aware of external factors that act as barriers to process they may respond by advocating for reexamination of the system by the leadership

it differs from the term in that as individuals begin to discuss difficult topics those facilitating cannot guarantee that there will not exist risk
this shift in language helps those involved in conflict or struggling with issues of justice to voice their concerns and rise to the more difficult work of engaging in difficult dialogue

neutrality silence widely agreed upon tenet for om buds om buds debate the possibility of whether an om buds or indeed any individual might truly remain neutral and unbiased
truth and fairness exist as key values for the om buds role
while om buds strive to understand the perspectives of all parties faith endures in common core of facts about which it would be possible to have agreement between the parties
the current climate challenges this assumption with the rise of alternative facts given credence based solely on their having been asserted
how does one engage in discussions or address alternative facts without impacting neutrality or becoming silent and not advocating for fairness

such an endeavor requires navigating the intricacies of internal and external forces satisfying multiple levels of stake holders fostering environments for diverse disciplines securing scarce resources coordinating the eve interdependence and most importantly for the purpose of this article managing the conflicting governance cultures that make higher education unique enterprise
within higher education there coexist two distinctive governance cultures on the one hand bureaucratic more corporate culture of administration with an emphasis on centralized decision making organizational hierarchy and system of policies procedures and objectives intended to make higher education run more like business
on th other hand faculty led cultures are characterized by laissez faire collegial culture of educators that value debate shared decision making and autonomy meant to foster environments that stimulate creativity and critical assessment sometimes of the very systems and practices that it operates within
in addition supporting staff are accountable to both cultures and perform delicate dance between the two
administrators face number of dilemmas because the same policies that protect productive faculty with tenure or multi year contracts also protect the less productive bol man and gall os and there is an increasing need to keep up with the external pace of accreditation diversification and innovation
some might be reluctant to admit that some of these unique features may contribute to higher likelihood of interpersonal and group conflicts among employees but conditions are ripe for competition over resources conflicting views and power struggles
the research also indicates that admin is tra tors are often unprepared to manage these conflicts because the career ladder from faculty to administration does not typically include administrative experience or leadership training
in fact about of academic leaders in the us have any type leadership training or preparation gm el ch as cited in bol man and gall os and many say the move into leadership position was unanticipated cullen and nickers on
one study of experienced and new deans asked tasks and ac ti vi ties those new to leadership roles struggled with most and what experienced leaders wished they had known before taking their and found that struggles they identified were strikingly similar falling into three nearly universal cat eg or ie the ability to lead organizational change the ability to think strategically and solve problems creatively and the ability to develop new leaders and communicate cullen and nickers on
each of these elements are critical for org ani zati on al health in university
nevertheless there appears to be light at the end of the tunnel illustrated by growing number of institutions implementing internal conflict resolution specialists available for their employees
these specialists in the of existing employee mechanisms by providing menu of services aimed at managing workplace conflict in ways that are more constructive effective cost efficient and compatible with the stated values and mission of the american university system
this article provides information on eleven different higher education institutions to demonstrate how conflict resolution specialists and om buds find their place within their university system how they operate and what their primary functions ar journal of the international ombudsman association so sa and ko va ck brief history of resolution higher education some form of dispute resolution has existed in higher education for centuries
student conflicts have used number of avenues including deans department chairs student affairs and more formal grievance and peer jury processes
similarly employee conflicts have traditionally been escorted through the formal chain of command before being investigated by human resources legal services or similar adjudication office
in both cases the de sign ated decision maker conducts some form of investigation decides on the merit and issues verdict that may be an implication of innocence or wrong doing followed by disciplinary action or exoneration
all of which is rights and power based approach to conflict management based on zero sum method that mirrors the legal system and falls short addressing the underlying interests or concerns that drive workplace disputes and affect interpersonal employee relationships
this approach is often costly in both time and resources and does very little to positively impact workplace morale because most workplace complaints meet the test of legal standard meaning they are inappropriately handled
the last few decades of the twentieth century witness ed global expansion of alternative dispute resolution approaches and the emergence of the om buds field in the us by the social protest movements in society at large and specifically on college campuses in the late
this was ca ta ly st for the first few student and campus om buds programs including simon frazer university in british columbia east montana state university and michigan state university who were responding to growing unrest on their campuses
th term is of swedish origin meaning and is conflict management role utilized in organizations
it is often used interchangeably with the terms and for short
according to the history of in higher education by the center for mediation in higher education was set up to encourage institutions to adopt the use of mediation at all levels wart ers followed by funding from the william and flora hew lett foundation in the mid in te nd ed to assist universities in the development of practice relevant theory in analysis and resolution vol pe chandler
this snowballed into twenty prestigious universities including harvard syracuse northwestern and several additional big ten state universities to develop research educational courses and practice activities in resolution
it accelerated the use of methods as dispute system alternative
by approaches experienced sufficient growth and recognition to initiate the national conference on campus mediation programs ned by professor neil and campus mediation center ire ct or bill wart ers at syracuse university as cited in
the growth of conflict resolution specialist and services continued throughout the and first part of the st century
especially noteworthy was the establishment of mb uds offices and other conflict resolution specialist set up by universities to handle employee dispute in addition to student issues
by nearly colleges and universities were listed as members of the international om buds man association with the majority of these institutions having services for all members of the university
this growth indic at es the use of more creative and suitable methods supplementing traditional practices in addressing day today conflicts with informal methods that include preventative measures such as coaching and conflict management training as well as facilitated in te such as mediation conciliation group facilitation and arbitration on the more formal end of the spectrum
for some om buds it also includes providing insight for administrators on trends and areas of concerns that they identify
it is likely th at this expansion was precipitated by number of landmark employee lawsuits experienced by institutions like the university of minnesota and the university of georgia
now universities in states like georgia and florida follow state laws that require publ ic colleges to have college who can assist to florida dept
journal of the international ombudsman association so sa and ko va ck another factor fueling the growth of services for all members of the university community is an increased awareness of the cost and ef fec ts of poorly managed conflict which is considered to be the largest reducible cost in organizations cram and mac williams
workplace conflict contributes to the exorbitant cost of legal cases worker absenteeism and present ee ism turnover rates and it is estimated that managers spend to their time settling disputes between team members raines
services like informal consultations mediation problem solving and leadership training are also more closely aligned with the vision mission and values of modern university that emphasize community inclusiveness diversity collaboration and communication
most importantly it provides compatible methods for dealing with the substantive procedural and interpersonal ssu es at the core of most workplace disputes
it is particularly appropriate for navigating the institutional complexity of coalitions departments and divisions each competing for scarce resources such as funding and access to those with decision making power and all with differing underlying interests
the authors consider this trend to be recognition of the need to manage the human side of higher learning organizations and the potential of conflict resolution services to enhance administrative capa city and organizational effectiveness which can positively impact morale and quality of work life balance for its employees
methods this research began as part of graduate level collaborative learning course on conflict interventions with special focus on the role of mb uds
the professor and his teaching assistant conducted preliminary research on organizations that employed om buds who were internal facing meaning their duty was to assist the employees and not external customers
the students then conducted preliminary research on organizations of their choice either from the compiled list or from their own research that met the criteria of internal facing non federal higher education or private sector organizational om buds
if the organization was willing to participate the students conducted an informal case study
from this research the professor and his now two assistants and co authors selected only colleges and universities with internal facing om buds for emp lo yees then expanded the sample set to eleven in total to add variety to the sample in terms of public private universities size of population and sectarian or non aligned
the authors further developed the research using qualitative methods including sec data and telephone or email correspondence with the conflict resolution specialists at each of the institutions
the authors were particularly interested in how and why the universities created the role the structure and operation of their office what the day today work of an om buds consisted of their standards of practice who they serve the perceived value of the om buds and how that value was evaluated
the om buds or conflict resolution offices in the sample set for this research can be foun in table
profiles for each of them can be found in appendix and the general findings are presented in the following section
although the sample size is not large enough to make robust generalizations the purpose was to explore the intricacies of the unique role within complex university systems and not to describe large quantifiable trends
in addition the authors hope that this research and article can provide different examples of how higher education administrators contemplating the use of con resolution specialists can establish the roles within their own university community and the advantages of doing so

the majority were born out of need or expressed desire from stake holders for its implementation and it is likely that the international om buds man association or its former associations lit ated their formation by providing support as an external body with standards of practice and the framework needed to give the role credibility
the majority of om buds and conflict resolution directors of various ages and background had specialized train ing andor experience in conflict resolution methods divergence from other types of organizations where om buds are often senior members of the existing institution
all of them provided menu of services including coaching mediation training etc
and all of them used active listening and problem solving or option gen erat ing techniques as critical entry point for managing employee issues
they had three major functions which included addressing the top employee issues conducting educational out rea ch and serving as conduit to bring systemic issues to the attention of leaders
surprisingly all used some form of qualitative andor quantitative data to demonstrate value typically through annual reports highlights of employee trends or tracking he journal of the international ombudsman association so sa and ko va ck number of visitors
none appeared to use any cost savings or cost of conflict metrics although their collaboration with other offices is promising for its future realization
finally few universities have top level administrators who recognized the function as essential to any healthy human organization
each of the findings is detailed in the following sections
pragmatic rather han purist approach the authors found that most institutions took pragmatic rather than purist approach to cre ating fit for conflict resolution role within the culture and operations of their organization
some varied by title scope of constituents and some served dual capacity roles within their university but most nine out of eleven could be categorized as al om buds
the swedish term rg ani zati on al ombudsman is often translated as or and is an internal person that assists the members with the resolution of conflicts or concerns
the prima duties of an organizational ombudsman are to work with individuals and groups in an organization to explore and assist them in determining options to help resolve conflicts problematic issues or concerns and to bring systemic concerns to the of the organization for is an organizational
nine out of eleven used variation of om buds title campus om buds faculty om buds university mb uds om buds officer or just mb uds
all could be categorized organizational mb uds and explicitly followed the international om buds man standards of practice meaning the om buds role was to the confidentiality of those seeking services maintain neutral impartial position with respect to he concerns raised work at an informal level of the organizational system and be independent of formal organizational is an organizational
of the eleven only two institutions profiled east carolina university and university of minnesota employ ed for their conflict es ol uti on programs both of which are housed under the office of equity and diversity and who report to second in command as opposed to the majority of om buds who report directly to the president
according to the standards of practice for the international ombudsman association it is critical to distinguish the role of om buds from other dispute handling offices like hr human resources employee assistance programs legal and gen er al counsel office of equity and diversity wd workforce development or the like
by creating directors instead of om buds these two universities are able to exercise some flexibility in the establishment purpose and the services provided
for at university of minnesota the director of the office of conflict resolution julie showers has the same function of an om buds but on occasion assists in the adjudication process of formal grievance since the office handles both informal nd formal channels
an om buds would not be able to perform this function because it would be in contradiction with the standards of practice
another pragmatic approach to fulfilling the function of conflict resolution specialist on budget is to ap poi nt faculty members who can serve dual roles
in the federal government this is referred to as collateral duty
four of the eleven served dual roles as faculty and om buds and most received reduced time andor stipend to fund the operations as well as it being considered part of their service to the university
looming question remains about the purity of impartiality and independence for such role but all of them felt confident that they upheld the principles
dr day the faculty om buds at university of missouri kansas city um kc asserts that as faculty member she does not conduct performance appraisals of faculty or have power over other faculty that would compromise the principles of practice
similarly none of the other three appeared to serve any administrative or supervisory roles and therefore did not have formal power over other employees
journal of the international ombudsman association so sa and ko va ck however the authors also observed that most of the institutions who used dual role om buds served significantly smaller num ber of per year than those who had one or more full time staff assigned to their office
dual faculty om buds served between and visitors per year while other om buds served between and visitors per year
the only exception was ken ne saw university who employs two dual role campus om buds and handles approximately cases per year
these numbers do not reflect the number of employees reached through various mediums like presentation workshops om buds blo gs and other forms of outreach
however it could be an indicator of the limitation of the dual role and is factor for universities to consider when evaluating the scope of impact that an om buds or conflict resolution specialist can make when serving dual roles
origins establish me nt and role of the not surprisingly most of the universities profiled six out eleven established conflict resolution channel for employees because of an immediate conflict or issue they faced and need for ongoing resolution
for example the university of minnesota es ta bl is hed the grievance office which later evolved into the office of conflict resolution after landmark sexual discrimination lawsuit in that negatively impacted the university
similarly ken ne saw university and all other georgia system universities implemented channels after widely publicized university of georgia dispute that awarded professor jan kemp million for wrongful termination
few years into implementation university system of georgia chancellor stephen porch in noted that the conflict resolution initiatives have the system millions of dollars per year in litigation yarn
others like mar quet te university identified diversity issues as catalyst to pursuing conflict resolution role while some said they were responding to frustrations regarding faculty grievance procedures
four other universities simply adapted to the growing trend in the and took preventative measures to mitigate escalating conflicts
the establishment of th ese offices or roles were also methodical and most included an initial influential champion working group committee and collaboration with key stake holders which included support from high level administrators
at the university of california santa ar bara the establishment of the office of the om buds followed academic senate recommendation for its implementation
even so after the om buds who served for years retired uc sb issued ten person task force on resolution and mediation to examine ways that problems between and among staff faculty and students were resolved on the uc sb campus and to recommend the optimum conflict prevention and mediation matrix for the campus
the task force found that despite conflict and complaint es ol uti on resources available none ensured neutrality and the campus was lacking systemic process that allowed the latitude to deal with intra or inter department conflicts
thus they made the recommendation to reopen the om buds office in january
similarly at east carolina university committee was set up with representatives from student affairs legal inclusion and diversity the chairman of the faculty and the vice chancellor of employee relations to determine the best fit for the director of conflict resolution and mediation program
at the university of south florida st petersburg faculty member de ni elliott served as campus om buds for years at the satellite campus
consideration for system wide om buds was propelled by then gene counsel steven prev aux under the direction of president judy gen shaft and included key stake holders like the board of regents union officials faculty leaders and high level administrators at their three campuses regarding the possibility and de sir ability of system wide om buds for its plus employees
system wide om buds role was then established in
in all cases gaps were identified in the existing dispute systems and establishment of conflict resolution specialist was int ended to enhance administrative capacity organizational effectiveness and expand the safety net for university employees
the international ombudsman journal of the international ombudsman association so sa and ko va ck association which officially formed in july following the merger of the university and college uds association with the ombudsman association toa likely played key role in facilitating the formation of these om buds offices because the associations essentially provided blueprint for the institutions to establish them
the resources include formal charter with standards of practice sop and code of ethics based on the four guiding principles of independence impartiality or neutrality confidentiality and informality
the also published manual for establishing offices in cad emic settings in by er
the manual defines the parameters of the om buds scope of practices the limitations of the authority and qualifications to become an om buds
the american bar association section of dispute re so lut ion also enacted charter detailing the for establishment and operation of ombudsman
all offices with titles stated either through personal communication or on their web sites that they followed the standards of practice most were members and few held certified organizational ombudsman practitioner or co credential
in line with the sop all but one of the om buds report directly to the university president and they exist outside of the organizational structure thus they cannot be found on an organizational chart
this is an indicator of the independence and the impartiality that they exercise which could be difficult to summon buy in for in traditionally bureaucratic system if it were not for established in standards that give the operations credibility
all om buds offices were funded by either the president or provost and others received administrative benefits in reduced teaching or service obligations in exchange for serving dual role
the two titled directors were structured under the office for equity and diversity but had independent offices like an om buds
characteristics ser vices and issues the authors held special interest in the substance of these programs hoping to learn more abo ut the om buds and background and skills the services in demand the types of issues they tend and their main functions
previous research and experience with federal and student om buds prompted the authors to believe that organizational om bud are often senior internal transfers and come from diverse vocational backgrounds
however out of those profiled here all but one had some form of specialization in conflict resolution or similar field
the om buds and directors had the following credent ia ls ph ds in conflict resolution organizational communication renown scholar and practitioner in dispute resolution certified mediators certified organizational ombudsman practitioner co certificate in dispute re so lu ti on professional in human resources sp hr juris doctorates with some specialization in labor arbitration or related focus and who had renowned career focused on ethics and labor practices note some respondents had more than one cre de so numbers add up to more than eleven
only one did not meet any of the aforementioned criteria but rather was selected on rotating basis in dual faculty role for having good rapport and people
he is also contributing me mb er of the
the authors believe this level of specialization is an indication of the rise in conflict resolution education in the last three to four decades that has provided an opportunity for those interested in the field to specialize in conflict res ol uti on methods
in addition to credentials those profiled seemed to personify sense of commitment and purpose for their unique function within the organization as being one in which voices and concerns matter even if they warrant adm in is tr at ive adjudication
kerry eg do rf of mar quet te emphatically stated that and voice eg do rf personal communication july
she sees her role among other value added functions as providing the av for those who feel vulnerable hurt or injured or just confused to speak in safe place about their concerns and issues and to hopefully obtain some form of fairness while possibly gaining new skills resources and perspectives
many explained tha their credentials contributed to their proficiency and that skills like patience listening and empathy journal of the international ombudsman association so sa and ko va ck were highly important
julie showers of university of minnesota explained that such role requires one to possess lot of patience and emp at hy it requires patience to listen to other people and it requires empathy to be able to relate to other personal communication march
de ni elliot of the university of south florida st petersburg explained hat as campus om buds she used active listening to provide the visitor with validation and clarity and then to provide guidance or resources specific to the issue
the majority provide services in coaching facilitation mediation trainings and interventions but not surprisingly it seems all of them begin with active listening and problem solving as critical entry point
it is important to note that listening as an ordinary act is not the same as active or reflective listening skills that resolution specialists are trained to practice
reflective listening for example is special type of listening that involves paying respectful attention to the content and feelings expressed in another communication often one with high emotion and sending your understanding of the essence back to the speaker in your own words to ensure accuracy lawyer sw ee dl er
it allows the speaker to feel heard understood and their feelings validated which allows the speaker to digest emotions and gain the clarity needed to move into discussion and action plans
it is intended to empower the speaker so they can self determine what the best resolution is for them
according to one of the om buds at le high university listening is the activity he performs followed by option generation
all of the offices make it known to their university communities that they address employee issues and are an independent impartial informal and confidential resource
all you need is eo ne to point you in the right says the stony brook university ombudsman office home page
they explain they are resource to help employees make sense of their complex organizations and what resources are available to them
many offer examples of the types of issues brought to them like north carolina state that lists sample cases ranging from facilitated group sessions for strategic planning to assistance in addressing salary or compensation concerns
angela dash at northeast oh io medical university handles concerns from simple practical difficulties to handling sensitive complex like incivility ethical dilemmas and harassment or discrimination matters does the om buds handle
in addition to hat they publicly state the authors wanted to learn about the most important functions or what they spent the most time doing
although no aggregate data was possible because all of the offices have different methods of evaluation tracking and reporting three functions stood out in their annual reports and correspondence
they provide insight into typical workplace dynamics within higher education
the first function is addressing the top employee issues which included addressing evaluative relation ships issues related to performance appraisals and poor communication
the second top function was conducting education outreach efforts which included internal networking to enhance the knowledge and use of their services as well as trainings log posts and disseminating resources
the third was the systemic review function of providing administrators with insight into employee trends and issues coupled with recommendations
function add re ssi ng the top employee issues among top employee addressing evaluative relationships was cited as the concern brought to them most often
at ken ne saw university the om buds reports that the majority of the cases involve evaluative relationships half of all cases and peer colleague relationships bout sixth
similarly orth carolina annual report cited relationships with supervisors as the number one concern of visitors and relationships with peer and colleagues the second most frequent concern
dr day of of missouri kansas city said she spends lot of journal of the international ombudsman association so sa and ko va ck time facilitating issues around performance appraisals and dr eg do rf of mar quet te university said the most frequent concerns brought to her are issues between supervise es and supervisors or between co workers and related to performance appraisals and employee duties responsibilities
at the university of california santa barbara the top most common concerns included communication respect treatment and performance appraisal grading
according to julie sho we rs
university of minnesota most complaints stem from miscommunication between supervisors and employees and in her annual report the most common issues across all types of employees included poor communication from leaders an inability or unwillingness to hear and respond to employee concerns and perspectives behaviors that were intimidating insulting or shaming in both private and public settings disrespectful email communication inconsistent application of rules and policies and the unavailability of training and support for supervisors around these issues
the policy most often cited in informal consultations was board of regents policy code of annual report
at first glance it could appear that all of these ni ver siti es face serious relationship and leadership problems but for those familiar with group dynamics and for those working within higher education these concerns are commonplace
relationships with authority are complex and evaluations can be either ff ir ming or contradicting of an self identity and therefore an area of contention
however considering the distinctive governance cultures that coexist one could see this as possibly problematic convergence of the two
on the one hand the la faire collegial culture of educators who create explore and teach with relative freedom and on the other hand the more bureaucratic corporate culture of administrators who are tasked with evaluating performance and meeting university objectives
addition staff interdependently lie somewhere in the middle likely with their own set of workplace cultures and need for effective leadership and communication
julie showers identified in her annual report lack of training and support fo supervisors around these issues
those who go into supervisory positions often lack administrative experience or leadership training
function education outreach second function identified was the need for education and outreach to promote their off ice their role the services they provide and conduct training and initiatives on identified areas of need and build internal capacity in conflict resolution skills
few examples include the conflict at neo med be nice ca mp ai gn hard on problems soft on at state and academic leadership workshop at east carolina coordinated by director nd sponsored by the provost on diagnostic and communication tools for managing con flic and delivered to deans department chairs and other top administrators
many of the om buds indicated that educational outreach was paramount to its integration acceptance and growth
some use blo gs others go college by college introd uc ing themselves and hosting workshops and some are integrated into orientations and campus community events
all used different methods or hybrid but all with the same purpose to create awareness of the options available to employees through their services and to promote conflict resolution competency within the institution
although difficult to measure some kept track of outreach estimates and it expanded their numbers from in person visitors to reaching thousands of university members
the con networking education and relationship building with other university offices that serve faculty and staff like human resources equity and diversity legal and helped them attract visitors and receive referrals
several expressed that serv in visitors was enhanced significantly when all of these worked together collaboratively appreciated that each had unique function and made referrals to each other when appropriate
journal of the international ombudsman association so sa and ko va ck function systemic review the function of syst emic review was particularly interesting
the authors were surprised to find that all eleven of the offices provided some systemic review function to university administrators either through evaluative annual reports or directly reporting to the top ad mini stra tors such as chancellor provost or both
according to the standards of practice ombudsman identifies trends issues and concerns about policies and procedures including potential future issues and concerns without breaching confident ia or anonymity and provides recommendations for responsibly addressing
this function is important because om buds have unique role that may give them insight into systemic trends and unintended consequences of org ani zati on al standards and as well as the ability to conflicts and tensions during times of organizational
such function requires crafting recommendations based on an ony mi zed feedback and having good rap port with top administrators
in recent article in the harvard negotiations journal on the disparities within the academic om buds field by er by er ma identified disparity in standardizing academic duty in making recommendations for institutional improvement
she found that standards make it clear that om buds people are expected to make recommendations but it is not clear if they should be made publicly or by er
in her research she found that percent of interviewees made private recommendations directly to leaders and administrators percent made public recommendations like an annual report and percent did not make recommendations at all
she concludes that those who do not make re com mend at ions could either feel it is not their duty to do so or it could be affected by their relationship with leaders in the organization
nevertheless those interviewed in this research emphasized their ability to provide or serve as an rly warning on systemic issues
at the university of california santa barbara the office of the om buds even has the right to inquire and look into matters that they believe warrant their attention without receiving any complaints from members of he community
om buds steven prev aux at university of south florida believes that organizational om buds are key in revitalizing corporate culture and advancing the strategic mission and om buds woman bu eh ler at stony brook ny addresses issues where she recognizes barriers and provides aggregate data as well as recommendations to remedy the situation
this holistic view of employee trends and systemic issues from the perspective of someone who is both within and outside of the univ ers it system is unique feature and one of great value
demonstrating tang ib le and intangible va lue cooperation may be he key in addition to the top three functions he question of value and how to measure it continues to be subject of disagreement in the om buds field
the provides evaluation categories that can be used in annual reports but some believe the tangible and intangible benefits that are felt by employees are not necessarily measurable and the need for strict adherence to confidentiality and low key exposure makes this difficult ro we and gad lin
dr day of the university of missouri kansas city is aware of the paradox between the standards of practice that eliminate individual record keeping and the need to uphold inform ality and confidentiality and yet demonstrate to others the benefits of the services provide personal communication february
although she does not track everything she does and with whom her annual reports highlight themes and the number of visitors she receives
all of the offices subscribed to some form of measurement using variables such as the number of visitors they receive estimates of outreach efforts and visitor surveys
the use of surveys was interesting because although not journal of the international ombudsman association so sa and ko va ck every one completes them they can provide useful information if designed to do so
there were several examples of creative ways to demonstrate value of services
for example at the university of south florida system wide om buds office visitors rate their sati sf action on like rt scale and are asked if they felt they had the opportunity to express workplace concerns if they were better able to address concerns and the likelihood of referring others to the om buds office
at north carolina state the visitor sur asks what the visitor might have done if they had not contacted the om buds office
out of twenty three visitors three reported they believe they would have filed lawsuit two would have filed formal grievance and one would have left the univ ers it annual report
all three could have been costly alternatives
according to om buds woman bu eh ler of stony brook of all cases come to me during an process where things have not escalated into major conflict or process as formal complaints or grievances
my opinion that this is good indicator of the value of an ombudsman to help visitors address problems conflicts early on before it involves formal processes and formal complaints to other offices expending more time and energy conflict and use of institutional
bu eh ler personal communication march
not to be overlooked is the strong possibility of emotional healing that can take place for both the person who feels they have been mistreated in some way and the other parties to the dispute
letter from mar quet te university president love ll and provost my ers alludes to this important therapeutic aspect that is more likely to occur with than with legal processes when he states any healthy organization particularly one as diverse and complex as mar quet te university disputes grievances and interpersonal conflicts are inevitable
as catholic jesuit institution committed to the tenets of cura personalis it is important hat we have in place variety of resources for individuals to seek resolution and ultimately the office of
none of the programs explicitly used any cost savings cost of conflict or return on investment calculations to eva lu ate their work
some within the field have argued that practitioners cannot assume their value and they must work toward cultivating evaluative goals capacity and value especially in budget challenged organizations such as universities sch en ck and ins ser as cited in by er
there are many challenges to evaluation including objectivity access to data for cost measurability the less visible intangible consequences or benefits of services and the lack of standardization for this practice
part of the issue lies in the fact that there exist well developed analytical tools to monitor and analyze income expenditure and other financial data most organizations lack systems monitoring cost of buss
some factors are easier to measure such as turnover rates and legal fees while others are more difficult such as missed opportunities miscommunication and unpleasant work environment buss
however there does appear to be path in the right direction
nearly all of the om buds or directors of conflict resolution served separate yet cooperative role with other offices like human resources legal ethics and diversity and receive referrals from variety of departments and offices
their ef forts to educate and cooperate with others is critical to building rapport and trust within the university system but it could also be the beginning of creating cooperation with offices such as finance and legal to collecting and analyzing select ed set of easily visible and measurable that can increase the ability to evaluate effectiveness and cost savings buss
for example reduction in the number of employee lawsuits could mean significant cost savings in legal fees be caus for medium size enterprise or less employees the average cost of defense and settlement is per lawsuit and days to resolve his cox
if the case goes to court median judgment is an additional not including the cost of settlement payout or productivity losses employe ment journal of the international ombudsman association so sa and ko va ck practice liability
at the university of minnesota in fiscal year showers conducted consultations of which only filed formal grievance annual report
an estimate of formal grievance cost could provide cost savings evaluation that further supports not demonstrates the value of the ir office of conflict resolution
in the broader context of the field of conflict resolution this topic is weighed down with el uc tan ce and theoretical disagreement which is reflected in its practicing branches like that of the om buds field
some remain more comfortable with qualitative descriptions and rely heavily on the four standards of practice for the distinction fro other units within the organization
several of the participants interviewed perceived their value at least in part to be based on the top administrators continued support and funding for their office
however given need to evolve and ep up with number of external and internal trends it is the opinion of the authors that conflict resolution professionals should do the same and strive to improve their own systems of evaluation as many of the professionals interviewed here have done re gard less of the lack of consensus on the subject
it is part of the need to make business case for conflict management because seemingly rational and number driven business world no matter how compelling be people from ac co un ti ng finance and other quantitative backgrounds prefer to make decisions on the basis of financial estimates before accepting conflict cost management as business as cited in buss
conclusion unfortunately our research revealed that despite those profiled many universities still default to hr and legal services to handle interpersonal employee conflicts
some research suggests that less than of complaints meet the test of legal standards while over cons is ts of perceiving actions as offensive and its accompanying emotions herman as cited in con drey
therefore the problem lies not in the use of these offices but rather in their limited focus and resources because each has its own purpose
none of th em are designed to mitigate interpersonal issues that do not break the procedural policies and regulations they oversee
the research is reaffirmed considering the top employee issues identified among the eleven universities addressing evaluative relationships issues related to performance appraisals and poor communication which are better suited for informal conflict management channels
in addition higher education employees are often reluctant to utilize the legal or rights based proc ed ur es because of the power discrepancies inherent in the bureaucratic hierarchal culture of higher education administration
institutions that rely heavily on power and rights based methods to address employee conflict needlessly escalate the cost of poorly managed conflict and neglect promoting understanding compassion empowerment and creative problem solving for employees and students as the norm rather than the exception
there are two reasons this may be the case
one is pervasive culture of looking at conflict through legal andor production framework and seeing employee conflict as liability
another reason is general lack of profound understanding about dispute resolution alternatives which seemed to be required for those in decision making positions to gain the trust and support necessary to establish om buds as was evident in the establishment of most of the universities in the sample
higher education leaders who embrace the growth and expansion of conflict resolution resources help re fra me the understanding of conflict as one in which conflict is normal and expected and who provide opportunities to manage it constructively are implementing for its institutional inhabitants
universities that overlook the ss en ce of typical workplace disputes are neglecting the research that shows that procedural justice sense of fairness commitment to halting offensive behavior and psychological satisfaction are just as important and related to the in te rest in protecting its legal and financial resources as journal of the international ombudsman association so sa and ko va ck well as public reputation
leaders who are reluctant should bear in mind the sentiment expressed by an om buds interviewed in research who stated suggest university would not need one would be fantasy because it would have to be place where all policies are fair no one abuses power and all communicate well and all community members understand their rights and
the research indicated that the om buds and conflict resolution collaboration with other offices is promising for further development of evaluation methods in which tangible data could be used for cost savings and cost of conflict metrics that can facilitate making the case for these services to satisfy the more corporate culture of administration who is tasked with resource management
however as important as the tangible data on return on investment might be it is at least equally important for proponents of these ser vi to also advocate for the value of the intangible benefits
the most general being that it humanizes the institution by providing barrier that are safe credible and accessible ro we and gad lin and one in which become the one individual in complex institution that constituents trust the by er
it is way for higher education institutions to manage their distinctive governance cultures in proactive manner and demonstrate commitment to their espoused va lu es
leaders illustrate this practice by publicly stating that their om buds office is an service to our and it exemplifies congruency with the institutional values and tenets of cura personalis defined as caring about he academic spiritual and developmental needs of the whole person justice defined as fair processes and consistent implementation and excellence defined as self reflection and continuous institutional improvement president love ll and provost my ers
om bud eg do rf at mar quet te university captured the spirit and essence of this important benefit when she stated think it sends out message to the organization or our university that we care about our employees faculty students and constituents an that we care about their experience here

the location was selected specifically to have it completely separate from the main administration buildings
standards of practic the mb uds to the international om bud sm an association four standards of practice independence impartiality informality and confidentiality
the independence and confidentiality are evident in its separation from the un ive and autonomy of the mb uds to carry out duties without direct supervisor and with complete discretion
dr day is careful with her dual role within the institution and clear about upholding standards for her om buds role that are distinctive from her faculty role
the faculty ombudsperson charter and let ter of agreement prohibits the mb uds from serving on any committee such and promotional and tenure that would have an impact on employment decisions or faculty related resource allocations

dr bark is has doctorate in counseling psychology practices as licensed psychologist and serves as an organizational consultant
for over decade she served as director over counseling student health and testing and disability services and as received training as an om buds
perceived value dr day is aw ar of the paradox between the standards of practice that eliminate individual record keeping and upholding informality and confidentiality and the need to demonstrate the benefits of the services provided

for example themes of issues included student incivility lack of clear definition of non traditional faculty roles part time faculty disparity in rights and responsibilities de part mental gaps by not having up to date governing regulations or bylaws promotion and tenure review processes performance evaluation procedures and under developed communication skills
annually she receives between and visitors but this does not include the amount of faculty reached through other training and educational resources that are more preventative services

she also has an expertise in active listening and solid commitment to importance of ethical practices and facilitating processes to empower individuals to best advocate for themselves
this is an important characteristic because empowering individuals to advocate for themselves is implied in the impartiality principle but often overlooked as meaning simply detached from the issue or person
rather impartiality implies that the mb uds is without favoritism but also an advocate for the capabilities to manage conflict
journal of the international ombudsman association so sa and ko va ck perceived value the mb uds believes that among her contributions to the university is serving as an warning to potentially troublesome behaviors and practices at the university serving as an important alternative to the formal complaint system that might go to litigation and providing an opportunity for people to talk about their issues and explore alternatives in safe confidential environ men with trained listener thereby reducing the human and resource costs associated with the more formal avenues

journal of the international ombudsman association schneider amply fi ng trends wit data one primary function of an organizational om buds is to identify and report trends in visitor issues and make recommendations for responsibly addressing them best practices supplement to standards of
while this is often referred to as there is also apparent value in reporting laterally across the organization to those who have discretion and proximity to address matters directly locally and ef fe ct ive ly
but under what circumstances should issues be reported and to whom
there is no magic number of incidents that creates trend no clear algorithm for determining when concern might warrant broader more systematic response
moreover rep or ti ng trends and making recommendations are delicate tasks that may produce unintended consequences
the om buds must tenaciously protect the identity of her visitors which can be challenging when trends relate to areas of the organization that are smaller or have very unique purpose
om buds also risk offending those who have clear and well defined oversight in the areas of concern
this important aspect of om buds practice is precarious work that requires well planned communication and mutual respect
trends should be brought to light when systematic response seems warranted when concerns seem to be frequent or serious
one way to evaluate the ubiquity of an issue is to mine existing relevant data
data can provide more comprehensive look at an and help the om buds frame feedback regarding issues that were brought to her attention
data supported trend can serve as powerful impetus to change
the purpose of this article is to demonstrate how om buds offices can use data about the organization and its constituents to inform practice and policy considerations
identifying relevant data can add power to the more subjective understanding that comes from interactions with visitors
specifically this article will present data about the experiences of special population of undergraduate students at large public university which were used to affirm and clarify stories shared in the student om buds office
identifying trend the student om buds office at university of south florida in tampa welcomes about visitors per year
the institution is very diverse and om buds visitors reflect that heterogeneity
even so the om buds noticed disproportionate number of students in their thirties forties fifties and sixties students who were st rated by system that seemed to be designed for younger learners
the om buds staff became specifically interested in those who were pursuing undergraduate degrees
this population comprises collection of adults who may have begun college early in lif but stopped out for some reason to raise children pursue career etc
or those who pursued other interests early in life and have recently decided to attend college
the number of undergraduate students at the university who fall within this age an ge is not proportionally substantial but common sense and fair mindedness suggests their concerns are worthy of the consideration
these students brought myriad of complaints mostly related to course availability curriculum and faculty dynamics
some academic programs are small and only offer courses during daytime hours which is challenging for working adults
while the number of online course offerings at has increased each year many programs still offer only traditional face to face courses which are less flexible
other degree programs go so far as to require full time enrollment which is also not feasible for many adult learners
one om buds visitor was forced to change her major because her desired major required commit me nt to daytime classes that she simply could not manage
this affected her career options and seemed unfair
another student was considering transferring to earn degree from more expensive non accredited institution because the journal of the international ombudsman association schneider university did not seem able to accommodate his work schedule
the om buds met with several adult students who had resolved to complete their degrees but who encountered seemingly insurmountable challenges with scheduling and course availability
another common concern shared adult learners related to attendance policies that restricted their ability to manage other aspects of their lives
one grade was reduced because she did not go to class when her son was having surgery
when she approached her professor he reiterated his attendance policy
child was in car accident which caused him to miss an exam and while he was able to eventually make it up that was only after navigating number of bureaucratic hoops and long after the course had ended
he exp re ssed feelings of frustration because he believed his grade was negatively affected by issues beyond his control
visitors also complained about course material and teaching style
several students had already completed career in specific field and entered the university with sense of what they needed to learn in order for their degrees to be meaningful
they expressed frustrations about content and also about pedagogy
for example one student said his entire class failed an exam so the instructor let students watch movie and write response for extra credit
the movie was in no way relevant to the course content
the visitor was certain the younger more traditionally aged students were grateful for the opportunity to raise their grades but he was committed to mastering the material and was disappointed by the accommodation
others talked about attempts to respectfully challenge what was being taught in courses and how they felt shut down by instructors wh were unwilling to engage in that kind of discourse
other concerns brought by these visitors related more to customer service and support
they shared feelings of vulnerability asking for help from faculty and staff especially those much younger than the students themselves
faculty and staff members often want to give uniform support and treatment to their students
when student in her sixties expressed need for extra assistance accessing electronic resources for research project it was refused to her in an effort to treat all students equally
another student was upset by an academic suggestion that her aspirations of graduate school were too ambitious because of her age
technology and electronic business systems also tended to create challenge for students who were not of more traditional college age
students are expected to monitor their student financial accounts using an online system
the university does not generally mail paper bills and statements
this created problem for one student who historically satisfied his tuition bill with tuition waiver issued by his employer
one semester he took course for which charges exceeded the norm
he was not aware that there were additional charges until he was contacted by co ll ec ti ons agency months later since he was unfamiliar with the online system
these undergrad visitors consistently reported feelings of being misunderstood and alone
many said they were the only students in their classes who were not in their late teens or early twenties and that they had not met any other students like them
mining exist in data the experiences of these visitors are certainly not unique to students at
the literature confirms that adult students learn differently and that the youth oriented culture of large competitive research universities can be challenging for them kas worm know les
while efforts to improve the experiences of more traditional students are often rewarded with government funding and national rankings their effect may not be experienced ally by all students on campus
has gained at ion al attention for its strides in improving student persistence to degree attainment
while the success of this population of students may not align journal of the international ombudsman association schneider with any set of prescribed metrics the administration is committed to the welfare of all students
the om buds was sure that the university would be interested in the information she had gleaned from visitors and would want to explore feasible reasonable ways to respond
as she prepared to share their stories which were valid compelling but of small numb er the om buds decided to consult readily available data that were collected from students and generate comparative analysis of the experiences of this population of students and those who were of more traditional age
the national survey of student engagement ns se is national instrument used by hundreds of institutions annually to measure student experiences and inform practice
the reliability and validity of ns se has been well established which makes it an accurate source of data about the stud experience pas car ella se ife rt bl ai ch
the ns se instrument was created to assess participation in institutional programs and activities
results reflect how undergraduates spend their time and what they gain from attendance
ns se ata can inform the deployment of institutional resources and the organization of curriculum and other learning opportunities linked to student success national survey of student engagement
the ns se instrument is distributed to freshmen and sen io rs at every other spring term
the om buds used these responses to compare the engage men experiences of adult students with those of sample of younger students
there were ns se participants who were at least years old at the time ns se was admi nist er ed
the age of was identified as threshold for defining these students simply because that is the marker for those adults who are protected from age discrimination in employment matters
random sample of students between the ages of and was selected to serve as control group
these comparative analyses were conducted using sp ss
the specific items selected for analysis had to do with behaviors that enhance student engagement and success behaviors that detract or interfere wi th student engagement and success or perceptions of interactions with personnel
items reported in this article are those that rendered statistically significant differences between the two groups
findings simple independent test rendered valuable supportive evidence of some of the concerns student visitors had shared in the om buds office
for example according to the survey results students and over were more likely than younger students to care for dependents
while this seems rather intuitive it gives evidence to the fact that their lives are different which may warrant some different behavior on campus
these learners were also less likely to participate in high impact ra ct ices like internships
this affirms the idea that high impact practices were designed for younger more traditional students an that other practices may have more impact on the success of adult students
these data provided foundation for more creative approaches to the engagement of these students

the survey data also confirmed that classroom behavior and learning strategies varied significantly between these and younger students
students who were or older were less likely to prepare for exams with other students
work with other students on course assignments
or ask another student for help understanding material
they did however indicate more independent approach to their education
they reported being more likely to contribute to class discussions
to prepare multiple drafts of paper before turning it in
and to complete read in assignments in preparation for class
they also reported higher tendency to review their notes after class
all of these differences support the notion that adult learners at work independently and may feel quite alone as they navigate their educational journeys as was evidenced by the stories of om buds visitors
these findings supplemented by the compelling stories of individual visitors allowed decision makers to empathize with the experiences of he se students and consider ways the university might demonstrate compassion and support as they navigate their way through the academic system

come to class without completing readings or assignments
ns se results revealed that students who were or older sd
felt that they had fewer opportunities to solve real world problems in the classroom than their younger counterparts sd
this supported the experiences of visitors who expressed desire for more meaningful classroom learning experiences
many of the is it ors had experienced the and felt that the university could improve the quality of classroom content by raising expectations and making curriculum more relevant
the responses of these student populations regarding university support were also significantly different
students or older demonstrated less satisfaction with the interest in their academic success
for each of these items these responses were significantly lower than those of students who were
these findings are consistent with percept ions of it and not receiving consideration for special life circumstances
the data buttressed information the om buds was able to share with administrators regarding visitor experiences and provided compelling evidence of deficit that might be more closely scrutinized and addressed

implications after talking to adult visitors about their needs and the ways in which the university might better accommodate them the om buds concluded that broad programmatic solution may be neither feasible nor sensible
instead resolutions might involve simply ais ing awareness among faculty and staff of this population and all that makes it unique
perhaps simple campaign for fairness and empathy could alter the experiences of these students so that they feel like more valued members of the diverse complex un community
the student om buds and other faculty and staff including the director for faculty development developed proposal for an initiative that would address effective and appropriate service to an increasingly diverse student population
the curriculum engages university employees in conversations about core values that drive their work with students effective ways to manage complaints and opportunities they have to invest in success at every encounter
its content includes modules on cultural competence on al intelligence and problem solving
the intended outcome is for faculty and staff to develop common language an expressed expectation and brand associated with student care
this is one step of larger more comprehensive shift in the culture at us place where every student has an opportunity to succeed and every person on campus has role in that success
another more focused initiative being considered in response to these findings is the establishment of networking group specifically for these students
many adults who visited the om buds office expressed feelings of being alone
they were not even sure there were other students like them on campus
networking organization could host educational and social events throughout the year add re ssing some of the shared experiences at the university
journal of the international ombudsman association schneider course availability will continue to be challenge for students who span hundreds of academic departments and programs but the qualitative and quantitative data derived from the project long with the support of academic administrators may facilitate more individual approaches to course completion
an increasingly diverse student population certainly seems to warrant an increasingly diverse approach to higher education
conclusion the standards of practice of the international ombudsman association call for om buds to identify trends issues and concerns about policies and procedures and provide recommendations for responsibly addressing those standards of practice
this positions the om buds uniquely to influence timely and meaningful change
simple analysis of available data from larger sample of constituents can substantiate the anecdotal yet compelling stories an om buds hears
these data alone however ca adequately convey the full scope of experiences
the om buds office is safe credible space that permits candor from constituents who may be less inclined to share in other venues
many om buds are exempt from reporting information that ot he organizational authorities would be required to share creating risk free zero barrier space for discussing even the most egregious concerns
visitors are often outliers those not likely represented by broad encompassing data collected across the or ga ni zati on
the om buds is able to listen compassionately empathetically non judgment ally and then when appropriate give voice to concerns without identifying the source
this ability to gather rich perspective from visitors coupled with more comp reh ens ive and scientific evidence of such issues can enhance the communications with decision makers and maximize opportunities for appropriate timely and meaningful response

the research agenda for the organization al om buds profession liv in document when the international ombudsman association research and assessment committee formed in its terms of reference listed number of goals and duties to accomplish for the organizational om buds profession
the purpose of the committee centered on enhancing our practice through filling the research and assessment gap
the committee will also support research and assessment to promote excellence in pro fe ssi on al development to study om buds practices with the intent not only to understand what om buds do but also over time to improve practice knowledge and skills of experienced and new om buds persons based on research findings
the committee was also assigned eleven goals to achieve in moving forward in these purposes one of which was to create research agenda for the field
the creation of research agenda for om buds work is particularly important for number of reasons to ui de future initiatives within the organization related to research to outline the research priorities of the members of the organization for outside entities and to establish research as fundamental value to the organizational om buds field
for fiel that remains somewhat unclear to those outside of it due to its standard of confidentiality the research agenda opens up an opportunity for practicing om buds and other interested individuals to collaborate on expanding knowledge base in an under re sea rc hed area of study
is not the first organization to pursue the development of research agenda even though there is no agreed upon definition of research agenda at either the organizational or individual level
generally research agenda is an outline to guide future inquiry and build toward achieving particular research goals over time
research agenda determines areas of study that require more knowledge in the short and long term
essentially it identifies gaps in the knowledge base and individuals to conduct research to fill those gaps especially in relation to the larger research picture
in setting research agenda the invites all interested parties to conduct research that will advance and develop the om buds profession
research agendas such as this one are dynamic living documents that organizations may revisit and revise as time progresses
the research and assessment committee organized the research agenda within three major categories that were identified by om bud colleagues nearly decade ago the om buds profession om buds practices and the om buds professional lincoln ro we and
within these categories the committee identified eight broad research goals the om buds profession
to examine how om buds demonstrate and communicate value
to better understand the standards of practice sop and code of ethics coe
to assess the development and health of the om buds profession om buds practices
to explain how om buds carry out their work
to describe how om buds gather use and report data
to determine how om buds build collaborative relationships in their organizations and profession the om buds professional
to explore the development identity characteristics and skills of om buds
to examine the nature and scope of the om buds role and position journal of the int er national ombudsman association bing ham et
supporting the eight goals the research agenda highlights number of research areas about which many om buds have questions detailed under results
this agenda serves as an invitation for individuals to engage in research on the om buds field from multiple perspectives using variety of qualitative and quantitative methods
the remainder of this article describes how the agenda was developed shares the agenda in detail and ug gests what it means and how it might be used by researchers
the article concludes with vision of the role and value of the research agenda for and the om buds profession
methodology gathering and analyzing data for this project was collab or ati venture
in autumn of the research agenda subcommittee set out to ask members about their research interests related to the organizational om buds role and profession
after considering range of options for data gathering the subcommittee decided distributing an online survey would be the most efficient way to reach members
the survey development process was what one might expect when group of scarcely affiliated professionals from multiple generations different regions of the ld range of academic backgrounds and perspectives and with very busy schedules engage in long distance collaboration
the subcommittee had series of interactions over period of many months via conference calls email exchanges and an online do cum en ts haring platform as they deliberated and discussed the merits and drawbacks of options such as using quantitative versus qualitative research methodologies as well as the focus phrasing and format of each question proposed for inclusion in the survey
ultimately the subcommittee decided to create qualitative survey using open ended questions that would give respondents wide scope to respond in whatever way they perceived as appropriate
the subcommittee used this approach to avoid imposing own assumptions about which research areas would emerge as most important
the survey comprised four questions that were phrased to correspond with the three major categories of research identified in previous research agenda lincoln ro we and se ab ok
the survey questions were would you like to know about the om buds professional
would you like to know about the om buds profession
would you like to know about om buds practices
and other om buds related issues and topics would you like to know more about
the subcommittee added demographic questions to assess the professional diversity of the respondents
these questions asked about membership status years as practicing om buds level of ed uc at ion field of study om buds sector and om buds office location
the survey was distributed to all current members approximately via survey monkey in september and remained open for days respondents answered at least some of the demographic questions and provided research ideas in response to the primary survey questions
although the response was smaller than expected that did not diminish the value of the data received
the purpose of the qualitative survey was not to gen er about the research ideas of all members but rather to identify the interests of members who were willing and inspired by the opportunity to share them

the majority of the participants responded to at least three of the open ended survey questions producing total of responses
since many of these responses offered multiple research ideas subcommittee member read through them to identify each id ea that could stand alone
this process resulted in total of individual research ideas that were entered into spreadsheet for further analysis
analyzing the data was rigorous and painstaking process involving multiple committee members as code rs of the data and several rounds of analysis
the process was more organic complex and at times more daunting than can be described in this brief article
the subcommittee was guided by and procedures for coding and ing qualitative data
first four subcommittee volunteers coded the research ideas offered in response to one of the survey questions and other committee members provided feedback
this process identified the in the data ideas for re search that were the same or very similar to each other
the research ideas were grouped into themes which were each given meaningful label
next two subcommittee members coded the themes grouping them into higher order master themes or and labeled them according to their common meaning
finally one subcommittee member reexamined all of the research ideas and themes looking for patterns within and across the buckets
this involved moving research ideas between themes and ts collapsing and pulling apart some of the themes and relabeling
the process resulted in set of major themes that were reframed as each with number of supporting themes that represented more specific areas or objectives for re sea
in the last stage of analysis the subcommittee produced document that organized the goals and themes within the categories of the om buds profession om buds practices and the om buds professional
the subcommittee shared the document with members of the research and assessment committee at large who provided detailed feedback and suggestions
the subcommittee then met several more times to digest discuss and apply the new input
they diligently rearranged modi fied relabeled and added information until they reached consensus on final document consisting of eight research goals supported by specific research areas
as in most successful collaborations the final product was more valuable and inclusive of multiple perspectives than any one researcher could have produced alone
results the re search agenda the research agenda includes eight critical research goals supported by specific research areas and positioned within the domains of the uds profession om buds practices and the om buds professional
these goals are research priorities their order is not intended to signify their importance

how om buds perceive themselves and eva lu ate their own work resilience and self care methods how and why people enter and exit the om buds profession research goal to examine the nature nd scope of the om bu ds role and position issues om buds help address om buds role in the organizational tem role variations in different organizational contexts caseload and workload functions and services provided discussion the research agenda that emerged from this study outlines topics and priorities for new research
because the agenda reflects the expressed interests of members researchers can consult it with assurance that delving into the suggested areas of inquiry is valued endeavor
in this section we discuss the research agenda as tool that can be used to focus and guide future re sea
we elaborate on the meaning of the eight research goals and how researchers might pursue them and then forecast implications of their use
using the re sear ch agenda the om buds profession
the first section of the research agenda incl ud es goals that identify research interests related to om buds
these goals focus on demonstrating and communicating value understanding the standards of practice and code of ethics and assessing the development and health of the pro fess ion
research goal examine how om buds demonstrate and communicate value
this goal speaks to an ongoing discussion in the om buds field
recent om buds conference agendas publications and regional group meeting agendas reflect growing interest understanding how om buds offices can demonstrate and effectively communicate the value of their role and work
everything from the use of quantitative data to demonstrate cost savings to the use of powerful narratives about challenges and successful case has been discussed
this goal encourages researchers to explore questions that can reveal methods approaches strategies and understandings that strengthen the case for the development continuation and support of individual offices and the overall fi eld
research goal better understand the standards of practice sop and code of ethics coe
this goal seeks to understand fundamental knowledge about the sop and coe
themes that emerged in the survey data suggest that om buds across the spanning various sectors want to know more about the meaning effectiveness application and challenges associated with the sop and coe set forth by the
recent conference plenary sessions which have received lot of attention and generated discussion and disagree men such as our guiding in and role of confidentiality and testimonial privilege for organizational in underscore the importance of this interest
research goa assess the development and health of the om buds profession
the survey data demonstrate an acceptance that the organizational om buds field is still new and has much room to grow
conference keynote addresses as look back where we are now and look in and the role of the organizational in journal of the int er national ombudsman association bing ham et
as well as articles like chuck of an inside outsider on the future and challenges facing and the organizational ombudsman prof in emphasize this research goal
they demonstrate that members have an interest and need to know more about the current standing and future of the om buds profession including the multitude of factors that will influence it
for instance how will new organizational policies societal norms and laws around sexual harassment in the workplace impact expectations of the om buds role and function
how will the field manage those changes
the second section of the research ag en da includes goals that identify research interests regarding
these goals include explaining how om buds carry out their work how om buds gather use and report data and how om buds build collaborative relationships in their org ani zati ons and profession
research goal explain how om buds carry out their work
longtime ombudsman howard gad lin once said know what ombudsmen do we only know what they say they gad lin personal communication
this research goal seeks to address this predicament and others by understanding exactly how ombudsman do what they say they do
additionally beyond the standards of practice how do om buds demonstrate or uphold core values like fairness and justice
how do they deal wi th complicated and challenging situations
what works well in specific circumstances and what
from working with individuals to working with groups and the entire organizational system the survey respondents expressed strong interest in con duc ting research that will lead to better understanding of methods approaches skills and strategies that enhance new and seasoned practices and improve their effectiveness
research goal describe how om buds gather use and report data
our res suggest that om buds and those closely associated with the field are interested in knowing how to gather and use data in the most effective ways
similar to demonstrating value the intersection between om buds work and data has received much at ten ti on over the last several years
these days get together of om buds to discuss their practices will almost always raise questions like do you track your cases
this goal encourages researchers to ex pl ore critical questions that will advance om buds practices around the use of data and increase understanding of important practices like records management
how can data support the demonstration of om buds value
how if at all do om buds use their data support issue identification and explore options for resolution
what are the challenges associated with collecting visitor case data
have om buds found ways to address those challenges
research goal to determine how om buds build collaborative relationships in their organizations and profession
as embedded organizational neutrals om buds are often faced with deciding whether to collaborate or partner with other organizational take holders to raise and address issues affecting individuals and their organizations at large
each sector and organization has unique set of stake holders
common stake holders might include senior leadership human resources employee relations office employee assistance and counseling programs legal counsel or formal complaint grievance offices
the survey results establish an interest in further understanding these collaborations including their appropriateness effectiveness and any best pr ac tic es that could improve their establishment and functioning
this goal also encourages researchers to explore the concept of om buds to om buds collaboration
what do we need to understand about the efficacy of om buds colleague support
what experiences or needs do solo om buds practitioners have that are similar to or different from the
the final section of the research agenda addresses goals that identify research interests associated with om buds profess io na these goals include journal of the int er national ombudsman association bing ham et
exploring the development identity characteristics and skills of om buds and examining the nature and scope of the om buds role and position
research goal to explore the development identity characteristics and skills of om buds
as the organizational om buds profession continues to develop our survey results tell us that people are interested in understanding makes good om buds
what makes people decide to be an om buds
what have om buds done personally and professionally in order to equip themselves with the education knowledge skills and understanding to become effective in their work
how do om buds know they are effective
what are the best tools and methods om bud use to determine or evaluate their effectiveness
at the same time survey respondents expressed interest in knowing how om buds care of
topics like self care and resilience as they relate to om buds work need further exploration
what can other service oriented professions such as counseling social work and psychology teach om buds about managing themselves when dealing with people in difficult situations and conflict
research goal to examine the nature and scope of the mb uds role and position
the organizational om buds role has evolved over the years
chances are it will continue to evolve
our survey results demonstrate interest in understanding different ways the om buds role within organizations has and will as well as variations in the om buds role such as in scope of practice issues addressed constituents served caseload office size resources and methods from organization to organization or sector to sector
common phrase people use in the om buds community is where you
in other words while many individual om buds adhere to the sop the way they perceive their role and perform their work within their own organizations can and must be different
among other things research unde this goal could help om buds understand what it means to where you including any accompanying challenges or drawbacks
implications the research agenda as data driven summary of research priorities has potential to shape the future of om buds research and consequently the profession in four primary ways
first because the research agenda delineates new topics for research it is likely to increase the number of individuals who study organizational om buds and thus the amount of research that is conducted
many prospective researchers who consider studying om buds work may ask themselves very basic questions such as is it about the om buds role that needs to be understood
or can make contribution to the literature that will be useful to om buds or valued by the organizations in which they serve
the research agenda offers answers to these questions and con se quent ly has potential to inspire both novice and experienced researchers by helping them choose focus and direction for investigation
with the agenda as guide individual scholars and practitioners can develop programs of research designed to probe into and build knowledge within particular areas of inquiry that are important to om buds and the profession
second the research agenda has potential to foster partnerships among those with common research interests
if the agenda is dis semina ted within the profession and widely shared with relevant disciplines in academic institutions and professional associations across the united states and around the world it will help researchers who are seeking collaboration to more easily identify one nother and begin to form professional research teams and networks
the research agenda can become widely known fundamental source of guidance for pursuing om buds research and create opportunities for within discipline and cross disciplinary research journal of the int er national ombudsman association bing ham et
it also can enable comparisons to other fields closely related to the om buds profession such as mediation coaching facilitation and organizational development
third because the research agenda provides an organizing scheme for research it can help make the body of knowledge about organizational om buds more cohesive and coherent and can more readily track the progression of research and be recognized for doing so
as more academic and applied researchers are inspired to inv es tig at the areas identified in the research agenda the published literature on the organizational om buds will expand and our knowledge of who we are and what we do will become richer deeper and more credible
with the research agenda at the center can play prominent role in structuring the literature as it grows making it more accessible and usable for om buds and the organizations they serve
finally the research agenda signals to organizations other professional associations higher educ ati on institutions and the general public that is now focusing on research and interested in developing body of literature about the om buds role and profession
the agenda communicates openness to scrutiny and assessment by researchers and commit me nt to developing evidence that can inform om buds practices
conclusion developing research agenda is no small task especially for field that envelops many different types of organizations and sectors as well as practitioners with wide range of ph il osophies and backgrounds
while one shared definition of research agenda does not wholly exist in broader society the research and assessment committee hopes the research agenda for the international ombudsman association described in this article ser as starting point for many new conversations exploring the nature and condition of the om buds profession the ways in which om buds practice and who serves in the om buds capacity
the committee additionally hopes people within and outside the om buds profession continue to reflect upon refer to and adjust this research agenda that it will guide research and evaluation efforts throughout and that it will help steer individuals in ways that enable them to contribute more fully to the field
the research agenda is living document that is likely to evolve as the knowledge base continues to grow

review the guide and guide are two books about cultivating the relationships that are so central to professional development and success of careers
zach ary seasoned human development professional organizational consultant and adult educator sees mentor ing as only partially concerned with the transfer of knowledge

sequential chapters entitled preparing yourself establishing agreements doing the work or enabling growth in the mentor book and closure of the relationship make up the bulk of both books
throughout these chapters zach ary inserts thought provoking checklists and reflective questions that encourage both mentor and ment ee to individually assess and monitor the relationship

bystander bys tan der decision ma king
influence hostile workplace behavior om buds journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly om buds and by stand in embracing in flu en ce as was thinking about what could offer to om buds in this article read wayne article on re imagining the organizational role and shannon piece on planned happenstance theory
what struck me was they were as ki ng om buds to embrace not only their formal organizational role informal neutral independent and confidential but also more broadly their place as member of the organizational community as someone who works there
both articles expressed concerns th at there may be times when om buds are so focused on being om buds that they forget or minimize their role and place as member of dynamic community where very presence influences what happens
thus while om buds have specific set of resp on si bi li ties articulated in the formal structure of the organization om buds also have responsibilities as fellow community members specifically accountability for behavior and duty of care for others in the organizational community
to enhance and bro aden possibilities for engagement and influence offer the perspective of the om buds as bystander
specifically will talk about by standing as influence and how om buds are ideally positioned as the ultimate active and constructive bystanders
will hen overview what is known about the why and how of by standing
will sh are some thoughts about how om buds can leverage their formal role to facilitate fellow organizational members to honor and embrace their in active and co way to utilize the power of their presence for good
in the process of talking about helping others encourage om buds to place themselves as and reflect on the ways they can more fully embrace their power as bystanders and expand their ability to influence
embracing the om buds and by st anding om buds are bystanders by virtue of their official presence
om buds are uniquely positioned to to be observers and to be aware
om buds and what is happening by being th person to whom others can bring what they see and hear
others tell om buds about their experiences often describing their own and the behaviors
the om buds has now become bystander
others te ll om buds about heir own by standing what they were aware of others doing or saying
at this moment the om buds is of ro we
in addition om buds review and consider policies and procedures the written embodiment of organizational mission and values and see the connection or gap with practice
most broadly om buds are repositories for organizational happenings and uniquely positioned to make connections and see patterns in the data
om buds also and as members of the organizational community ie an employ ee
these experiences are also data about what is happening or not in the organizational environment
thus om buds are present and very aware of organizational life and experiences in ways others in the organization are not
in terms of in flu en ce om buds are empowered by their organizational and professional roles to comment on what they see and hear
om buds are viewed as highly credible reporters
as result om buds are well positioned to identify specific issues that need to be addressed an to develop and explore options with others as to how to respond whether that is the individual who comes into the office or the
the metaphor of the mirror captures this aspect of being an om buds
mirrors reflect and provide the opportunity to cor re ct
as om buds share what they have learned they are reflecting the current status of organizational life and providing the opportunity for the organization to make
om buds themselves may implement some
for example om buds train educ at into the fac il it at connect and perform shuttle diplomacy and informal mediation
all of these activities influence experiences and the situation
thus om buds are already active and constructive bystanders
so journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly what ore could be suggesting om buds do
by more fully understanding by standing think om buds may expand their own options enhancing their own effectiveness as bystanders and organizational members
with this deepened understanding and experience om buds will then be better prepared to help organizational members embrace their own influence and develop efficacy as active and constructive bystanders
primer on by standi ng the term conjures up the image of the passive witness who is present at or becomes aware of situation but does not take action
this image is problematic for two reasons
being present in situation where someone is behaving in hostile or demeaning manner to another and not taking an action ie simply can be interpreted by the actor the target and others as supportive of what is happening and ensure the continuance of the engagement
second it is rare that bystanders are not doing some thing
indeed violence aggression incivility and myriad other undesirable behaviors are socially constructed and supported phenomena ie are involved in developing and sustaining them
for example bystanders are viewed as active and involve participants in the social architecture of school violence et al workplace bullying nam ie lut gen and incivility her sh co vis et al
in organizations coworkers and supervisors can be active or passive accomplices in the development and continuance of problematic interactions
they can also be active in disruption and resolution of problematic interactions mc mah on banya rd pa ull et al ro we
in order to facilitate people embracing an constructively utilizing their influence om buds need to understand how bystanders decide to take action and specifically what gets in their way
grounded in extensive empirical research social psychologists bibb and john dar ley dar le developed five stage model of bystander decision making regarding intervention
the first stage is noticing that something has happened the second is assessing whether it is problem requiring action the third is acknowledging responsibility for taking action the fourth is choosing the actions and the last is taking the actions
this framework has guided the development of bystander efficacy training for decades eg ash burn nar do et al banya rd ro we
unde rs tan ding the turning points individuals face on this path illuminates ways om buds can help people make informed and thoughtful decisions about when and how to become involved constructively fe ld man et al
becoming involved from ob serv at ion to ng age ment in this section will utilize and model to describe the decisions that bystanders face and the factors that influence thinking on the path to taking or not taking action
will share examples of strategies focused on addressing those influences that have found useful for myself and in helping others
have provided additional resources at the end of this article as well
om buds may find these strategies useful in facilitating other organizational members and in support ing the development of collective will and efficacy to address emerging issues
om buds can also apply these ideas to themselves as an organizational member to more fully embrace their influence
while the illustrations below will focus on addressing unacceptable or problematic behaviour bystanders can also respond to and promote positive and constructive behaviour ro we
journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly notice that some th in has happened if someone does not or is not aware of the situation or behavior they will not take action
there are two preconditions to noticing situation or interaction
first the person has to be present physically virtually or through learning from others providing the opportunity to notice
second the situ ati on or interaction needs to be captivating or of the
behaviors and interactions that occur repetitively and are unchallenged become normalized or ordinary so that people do not them anymore ro we
people are more likely to when the behaviour or situation contravenes norms or expectations for behaviour
there are multiple sources of norms including personal moral eg golden rule deontic justice professional ethics and codes of conduct and organizational vision mission values
norms in practice however are often implicit and co created in our interactions
through responses to different situations at work employees communicate what is okay and what is not ro we
at the organizational level what is stated in policy and what actually happens or is enforced may be different
om buds are often keenly aware of the gaps
strategies to tate an important proactive strategy is explicit articulation of or ms
it is important to engage organizational members in explicit discussions of guiding principles and values and the specific norms and expectations for conduct which make these principles and values manifest
beautiful example of this type of work the department communication protocol developed by larry hoover and refined by om buds tom
another approach is education about and identification of problematic behaviors
in the work on bystander training for sexual assault tical element for mobilizing people to action is to broaden definition of what is encompassed by the term including what appears to be seemingly low risk behaviour mc mah on banya rd
find this to be true for bystander ct ion to prevent workplace bullying and aggression
seemingly small acts of incivility can escalate to bolder and more direct hostile action such as bullying
useful visual depiction of such behaviors is displayed in cynthia continuum of
sharing the empirical research on the types and prevalence of behaviors that are found in organizations can fill in the details of this continuum with specific behavioral exemplars
another engaging strategy to identify problematic behavior is to ask people how they know someone does or does not value them
people can articulate those seemingly behaviors that communicate powerful message
for example jane and her colleagues debe be ask ed hospital cleaners about their exp erie with others at the hospital specifically their experience of being valued or not valued
behaviors by others that communicated that the work and by extension the cleaner was not important included people not acknowledging their presence in shared space not moving out of way when they were trying to work speaking in condescending tone to them or making mess of an area that had just been cleaned without apology
these are behaviors that many people have done yet have been unaware of the impact et al
this activity can be done one on one or with an intact group
another way people can be made to behaviors is when someone brings it to their attention
once people have been in an organization for while they get used to things
it is usually the outsider or ne wb ie who points out pattern or behaviors others no longer see eg did he do that
en courage om buds to become observers of their own work places and of themselves specifically to be mindful and journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly curious about we
one way to do that is to take on the perspective of the and how that person would characterize we do
for example om buds can imagine themselves as someone from another country or another planet even
it is amazing how taking an perspective makes the invisible visible the unnoticed noticeable
om buds can also talk to the newest per so in the organization and ask about their experience and what they see
even talking with someone from another unit about how things work in their unit can illuminate differences in experiences
for example developed fresh perspective on my academic department and my colleagues after worked on committee with representatives from other departments
as listened to their stories of department life realized that had been assuming that other departments were as po sit ive and constructive as mine
as result of the external exposure became more sensitized to why my department was successful and thus was more aware when my department began to head in less constructive direction
assess whether it is situation re qui rin action once pers on has oriented to the behavior or situation they need to discern whether what they see is problem and thus requiring action
bystanders are more likely to see situation as if they perceive negative impact or harm
this harm can occur at the individual level and or at group level
for example colleague stops talking after being interrupted or is looking fearful when the boss raises his her voice
if the colleague shows no not ic response or smiles bystanders are less likely to perceive harm and thus not see this as problem that is in need of action
in terms of group level harm or potential for harm faculty may perceive risk to academic freedom if colleague is fired for speaking their mind
the challenge with incivility aggression and bullying is that the harmful impact is felt in the persistence and patterning of behaviors rather than single behaviour itself
in isolation specific behaviour may not look like mu ch
if the bystander is not privy to the series of behaviors they may not perceive impact or may underestimate the significance or severity of the harm
strategies to tate discernment of problematic behav iou sharing information about the patterned and progressive nature of problematic behaviors and their cumulative impact is valuable as it highlights how seemingly minor or covert behaviors can harm
the workplace bullying and trauma institute has negative conduct and impact continuum tha concisely illustrates this
workplace bullying org bullying is workplace violence
the work on the impact of ostracism and exclusion williams and on micro aggressions sue is powerful illustration of the cumulative impact of mall
bystanders are also more likely to perceive harm if they believe the actor intended to create harm
unfortunately due to the seemingly minor nature of the individual behaviors it is difficult to discern the intention behind the behavior
or example not acknowledging someone in the hallway could be an oversight she see them or deliberate slight
strategy to help bystanders assess whether the situation requires action is to educate bystanders on how to determine intention
res ear ch on how observers discern that something is unfair and thus in need of action provides some insight
people make fairness judgments based on considering what the implications would be if the actor behaved differently ie counterfactual thinking
specifically the observer is considering three questions what call the coul da
would the outcome impact have been different if another behav had been used
journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly
could the actor have behaved differently
this discernment of intentional action how the actor accounts justifies their action as well as considerations of whether the target did something to create this situation
should the actor have behaved differently
th is is tied to beliefs about normative behavior and responsibility which discussed above
when person concludes that the actor could and should have behaved differently they are more likely to view the action as unfair and thus in need of redress par sal in
challenge is that fairness judgments happen rapidly and often below conscious awareness
it is important for people to explicitly state what they consider when making judgment so they can proceed thoughtfully and deliberately
useful exercise for om buds is to apply these questions to the presenting situation in the case of one on one coaching or representative scenarios if doing in group
in the process of doing this people realize why they consider something unfair or pro bl em at ic
for example what behavioral options were not taken or what norms have been violated
using this strategy bystanders may also realize an action they initially deemed harmful was actually necessary eg the constructive delivery of negative fee db ack in performance review
they may also discover that they do not have the information to make discernment about the intention but can identify what they need to learn in order to do so
for example they may choose to continue observing the people involved
this exercise can have an interesting benefit when intact groups such as team or unit members work on clarifying why particular interaction or behavior is unfair or problematic
as they explore this together they are also in effect talking with each other at meta communication level about what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior which can be woven into discussion of explicit norms see above
beyond their use in the above activity these coul da questions could form handy that people could use more pro actively and systematically to assess situations in their daily work lives
the notion of is not new to om buds
for exam administrative fairness checklists for decision makers have been developed by om buds at some canadian universities to facilitate deliberative and inclusive administrative decision making see
ca content dam om buds documents administrative fairness checklist
acknowledge and responsibility for aking ct ion this is key pivot point for bystanders in embracing and directing their influence
if an individ sees it as their responsibility to intentionally influence they are more likely to do so
assuming responsibility concerns obligations to help
obligation is grounded in social bonds and associated expectations
these bonds can be personal friends hip family neighbors professional coworkers team members organizational members or broader social bonds social group membership such as race gender religion being human
when an individual is in meaningful relationship with one or both part then relational norms come into play
for example the drunk driving campaign message let friends drive reflects the ethic of care in friendship and the obligation that friends help friends ad council
in the workplace te am work obligates team members to be there for and to help each other
in the military soldier left speaks to this obligation to help
the obligation to respond may be explicitly part of job description as with supervisors
org ani zati on al policy may articulate the obligation to help each other
there are also broader journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly moral obligations to engage reflected in religious values such as the christian ethic of thy
strategies for fac il it ating resp on si bi li there are two goals for this part of the decision making path discuss collective norms regarding responsibility to help and discuss how individual and collective responding can manage situation ie how influence works
regarding collective responsibility find it helpful to share variety of statements or illustrations of collective responsibility
here are some very visible exemplars of collective responsibility if you see something say campaign originally implemented and trademark ed by the new york city me trop ol it an transportation authority is licensed to the
department of homeland security as nationwide campaign
versions of this mantra are part of university campus campaigns regarding sexual violence alcohol abuse and other risky behaviors eg banya rd green dot bystander intervention program
live the green dot com would you do
or long running abc news program anchored by john sets up public situations where actors engage in conflict illegal activity or mistreatment and records what people actually do
go com what would you do
the by sta nd ers are then asked about why they chose to take action or not
this is rich set of video resources that can be used with groups for discussion of both problematic behaviors and what motivated people to take responsibility for action
another strategy is to have people discuss when they helped and when they did not and why
the discussion that results from this sharing often reveals assumed normative obligations
story telling regarding taking responsibility can be useful at this point as well
sh are stories that show fellow coworkers influencing situations by taking responsibility
favorite example is nurses managing the behavior of physicians who were abusive through the practice of sull ivan
briefly any nurse who sees th er nurse being mistreated by physician rallies other nurses by calling and the location of the incident over the public address system
any nurse who can shows up at the location and stands in silence beside the nurse being mistreated
an ot her example is the administrative assistant who monitors the mood
the assistant then lets others know whether it is good time or not to approach demonstrating gatekeep ing function
there are also very pragmatic reasons for why people should take responsibility
first the perspective of the bystander as observer is perceived as more credible than targets or actors
as result higher ups or those in position to foster change will take the bystander more seriously and thus be more likely to respond
second the bystander is more likely to be viewed positively for taking action in situation as opposed to dick ter et al
third research indicates that by taking action others will mobilize and as well fisc her et al
finally bystanders are impacted by what others are doing even if it is not directed at them ie bystander stress
witnesses experience similar harm and stress as result of exposure va rt ia
thus if only fo their own sake bystanders need to take some kind of action
journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly ch oos ing the ct ions once bystander has decided they have responsibility to act they need to figure out what they can do
the selection of action depends on knowing the actions that re possible given the specific context
choosing from among these options is influenced by the goals and the perceived benefits and risks for those involved including risks to the bystander kea sh ly
this section is very detailed be caus as with the decision of accepting responsibility choosing the action is another key pivot point in bystander engagement
identifying action possibilities often there is an assumption that whatever action is taken it has to be bold dramatic and thus risky
in some cases that might be true such as pushing someone out of the way of speeding car
however more often than not small often covert actions can have no table influence creating the space for the problematic dynamic or interaction to shift ro we
for example making eye contact with colleague who is being repr iman to show support or communicating disapproval nonverbally to the actor or keeping someone away from another person can shift the situation
many of these actions are things people know how to do and in fact do them eg kea sh ly neum an
in essence any action can make difference
the challenge then for by stan de rs is to develop picture of the range of possibilities for action
making the choice once person is aware of the possible actions the choices need to be narrowed down
the choice of action depends upon the goals desired outcomes or bene fits and perceived risk
table includes possible goals or desired outcomes for bystander action kea sh ly
some actions are more or less likely to help achieve the desired goal
for example if the goal is to name an inappropriate behavior so that it is not ignored relevant actions include naming the behavior directly not call each other invoking group norms is not how we are or confronting the actor all of which communicate the unacceptability of the behavior and affirm the group norms
common goal or desire is to prevent or stop harm which can be accomplished in number of different ways
direct action would be confronting the actor and telling them to stop which can be done in public or in private
bystander responding to putdown of another in meeting could affirm the target in an effort to offset harm
the bystander may want to prevent the actor from engaging in harmful behavior that could risk the soc face
distraction as an immediate strategy could disrupt the behavior providing an opportunity to engage with the actor later and talk about their behavior
table goal for bystander action name identify inappropriate behaviour so it is not ignored or glossed over uphold community norm value making clear that this behaviour is not supported in this space communicate that the behaviour is unacceptable without embarrassing the offending person save face phrase concern give feedback in way that the offending person is able to hear without being defensive create an opening for discussion protect someone from being hurt offended or prevent further injury protect someone else from causing harm they may regret
journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly tension between people may be due to miscommunication an open dialogue may eliminate misunderstanding surface concern that has been festering to prevent escalation into conflict or vi ole express personal values of the bystander enable an upset person to take rational view of the situation get help from someone better placed to intervene has the skill or capacity to handle make those responsible for the unit know what is going on adapted from mit om buds office white mal ko ws ki
as noted above there are various actions that could achieve specific goal
choosing among hose actions involves considering the risks and benefits of each action
being visible and public such as naming the behavior or confronting the actor carries certain amount of risk
personal risk includes retaliation and becoming the next target which sadly is not an unrealistic fear
social risk includes fear of embarrassing oneself evaluation apprehension disrupting own relationship with the actor and the potential stigma of being associated with dislike target mulder et al nelson et al
the degree to which these risks influence choice is affected by their relative power in the situation
higher power bystanders assume less personal and social risk and are more likely to engage directly
for example om buds are empowered by the org ani zati on to comment on what they see or hear about in more public and direct ways
faculty in universities may feel more empowered to engage if they are tenured and at less risk for retaliation
if perceived risk is high people may choose more low involvement action mac curtain et al mcdonald et al allowing the bystander to shield themselves from drawing unwanted attention
yet even these less visible actions carry risk as they may be viewed as
the target may experience this as getting no support the actor as getting support silence is consent and other bystanders looking for cues on what to do may assume nothing needs to or can be done
the risk of taking no action is also important to explore
takin no action is not no cost alternative
the potential costs include the sense of self as caring person would caring person not do something
their relationship with the target eg sense of betrayal and th potential for de sensitization to harmful actions and for contributing to the development of tolerance for such actions in the community
strategies for fac il it ating action cho ic the number of possible actions is enormous and thus can be overwhelming for an individual to consider
there are several action frameworks that attempt to make the options more manageable
these models provide handy action acronyms that bystander can recall in moment
om buds may find these useful in working with individuals in exploring their options or in training larger groups
the ds of bystander ct ion model see green dot bystander intervention program captures four broad action strategies direct step in to stop the distract the target or actor delegate get someone else and delay check in support the other
th document record incident as it happens has recently been added
this mnemonic has been used in tr ai ni ng college students in how to intervene in the risky behavior of fellow students banya rd
resp ons ability model highlights three broad action strategies confront deal directly with the behavior and the person shift focus through distracting journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly diverting deflecting or reframing and shifting the person work to change their attitudes that undergird their behavior
the third side framework is inherently about bystanders
it identifies roles for preventing and intervening in conflict
find this framework useful for people to visualize the various roles they could take on as community members based on their own inclinations and skills and the status of the conflict
the third side web site is rich resource of case studies and teaching materials ht tp third side
another framework have found useful is bow es and model that categorizes bystander actions in terms of immediacy when to act ie in the moment or after the fact and involvement visibility of the action ie in or out of public view
as can be seen in table crossing these dimensions reveals an array of specific actions
find this framework helpful in broadening id of what is and giving specific examples of those actions
many of these actions are well within current repertoires ie ro we
of particular note is the inclusion of non verbals and body language as action
these actions are relatively covert and thus low risk for bystander yet they can have powerful impact
the involvement dimension is particularly instructive for bystanders as it illustrates that there are actions that can be undertaken that ar less visible or which may be important if the bystander is concerned about backlash or negative evaluation
indeed research shows that people prefer low involvement or less visible ac ti on initially mac curtain murphy osullivan ma cm ah on turner mcdonald charlesworth graham
table potential bystander actions high im med ia cy low involvement redirect actor from situation remove target from situation interrupt the incident change the topic focus ask clarifying questions affirm the target counter image use body language to show disapproval eg silent stare process observation high im med ia cy high involvement tell actor to stop conduct name or acknowledge offense or issue publicly encourage target to report conduct get others to publicly denounce conduct offer another interpretation reinforce group norms low im med ia cy low involvement talk to target about experience privately advise target to avoid actor talk privately to the actor covertly keep actor away from target advise target to report incident refuse to share gossip rumors low im med ia cy high involvement report actor formally admin supervisor accompany target when reports coach target in responding confront actor after incident work to de velo pi mp le ment policies build the business case gather more information journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly adapted from bow es kelly and mit om buds office ht tp web
ht ml using brief scenarios of problematic behaviors is good context for dent if yi ng different actions that could be applied and what to consider in choosing among them
this helps people visualize what is possible
as an illustration utilize the following example from the mit om buds bystander web site ht tp web
example coworker makes joke involving an offensive stereotype during meeting in the moment high immediacy use body language to show disapproval low involvement frown clear throat wide eyed surprised look get and leave ask clarifying question low involvement what do you mean by that
name or acknowledge the offense high involvement that was harsh rude offensive
after the incident low immediacy talk privately to the actor low involvement know you well enough to know you mean it but someone could take offense or feel hurt report the actor high involvement choosing among the actions means considering the goals for intervening and the risks for each action that addresses that goal
using the situation above if the goal is to affirm norms of the community the actions of showing disapproval nonverbally or naming and ac kn ow ledging the offense could address that goal
choosing between these actions will depend upon the perception of risk to themselves of taking the action
for example nonverbal disapproval may be perceived as less risky action than publically labeling the offense much more visible action
labeling the offense also calls out the actor in way that could threaten their social face making them more likely to be defensive
in discerning risk the bystander needs to assess their relative power vis vis the actor
in this situation supervisor may not view the public labeling of the offense as particularly risky or that they could withstand the response given it is part of their job to monitor and evaluate their behav io before leaving this section on action choices it is important to note that sometimes multiple actions may be needed to achieve the desired goals
these could occur simultaneously or sequentially
for example in the situation of the ho stile comment by one colleague to another the bystander may take action to disrupt the interaction to prevent or reduce harm eg suggest that this is not the forum for these discussions and then follow up with the actor andor target regarding what ha pp ened and possibly exploring alternative strategies for addressing the situation
taking the actions once potential actions have been discerned they have to be implemented
this is another point at which people can get bogged down
the skills needed depend upon the actions chosen
some actions are relatively simple to enact such as making eye contact to show support for the target or changing the topic from the problematic one
others are more complex in terms of the skills required and the ng of actions
particularly challenging one is confronting the actor as doing so involves communicating clear message while also anticipating and mitigating possible negative impact such as defensiveness and retaliation
the actual confrontation is of ten not just one statement but also responding to and managing the reaction
journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly strategies to tate enactment of ac ti on effective engagement in action hinges on the confidence in determining is required and the of ct ment
skill and confidence comes through practice
the following are tools and activities that have found helpful for myself and in working with others
core skills model of communication bolt on
model breaks down the key communication skills active listening assertion and problem solving involved in managing conflict generally and confrontation specifically
he then illustrates how the interweave in managing conflicts of interests needs and conflicts of values
these are very specific actions that can be memorized and drawn upon very quickly
for example if the goal is to clarify the situation phrase like do you mean by that
spoken with an inquiring tone is useful
as noted earlier many behaviors are ambiguous in terms of content and intent
this phrase allows the opportunity for additional information to be shared that may influence what the bystander and others are
it also creates space for determining what subsequent actions if any need to be taken
some problematic situations can be anticipated due to their recurring nature permitting the opportunity to develop mini script which involves number of different statements and responses
bystander intervention programs like green dot and the mit bystander site are rich with examples of these types of phrases and mini scripts
people need to with skills and situations repeatedly and in different ways in order to develop sense of confidence in their ability to work with them
there are variety of ways to provide this practice
all involve the use of relevant scenarios and include be ha vi oral modeling showing how it is done discussions with others about effective ways to enact the action and roleplaying with feedback
these are core practices of bystander training programs
they are also tools that om buds can use as bystander of the bystander
to make things even more concrete it is important to have people map out the specifics of the situation they want to address how they plan to address it and what specifically they will do and when form of visualization and practice
more than one col le ct ive and org ani zati on al ct ion coll ct ion throughout this article have focused on action by an individual bystander
bystander action can include collective action as when people work together to implement pol ic on workplace conduct or request that management take action with respect to an actor or comment on problematic behaviors in meeting
the bystander decision making model and strategies discussed above are relevant for talking with people about working tog ether
exploring the options for actions that involve joining with others and how to most effectively enact the action should be part of the discussion and training
as with any discussion of engagement it is important to highlight the principles of constructive and nonviolent action and give examples of actions that may contravene that
for example social media has facilitated public notification of people to be held accountable for their behavior ie
making problematic behavior is ib le to others can be powerful sanctioning strategy one which the actor is motivated to avoid by refraining from the behavior
however sometimes online mobbing develops with focus on punishing and destroying the other ron son
om buds are pos it ion ed to model collective behavior help others think through the journal of the international ombudsman association kea sh ly risks and benefits of their options for themselves the direct parties involved and for the broader community and help others envision and practice their actions

during his exile with the ottomans king charles xii learned from the sultan about an official that existed in the ottoman empire the mo ht as ib whose purpose was to ensure that the laws of the empire were implemented correctly and fairly organization of islamic countries
the mo ht as ib had great deal of autonomy to investigate complain ts about government officials suspected of wrongdoing
king charles decided to create similar office in his homeland but he gave it swedish name the high ombudsman
om bud is word that has old norse origins meaning or lang
when king charles xii established the high ombudsman role in sweden in he enriched the meaning of the word
the high ombudsman was granted the authority to investigate complaints and ensure that jud ges and civil servants were carrying out their duties in accordance with the laws of the land
certain aspects of this understanding of the word endure though now there are many and varied uses of the term
in the swedish parliament absorbed the fun ct ion and the high was dropped from the name of the office in favor of simply ombudsman
king charles may not have been most original thinker but he did have talent for recognizing and claiming good idea when he saw one
his actions in the eighteenth century have significantly enhanced global reputation for both meatballs and the ombudsman
in the west neither turkish or the moha ts ib are mentioned much anymore but various versions of modern brand of the ombudsman unction have been adopted world wide by many governments
it is interesting to note that even the turkish government which had closed its moha ts ib office in recently established an ombudsman office based on the swedish model ka ras oy
within the past century or so an ombudsman function of one sort or another has been established by numerous governments international organizations corporations educational institutions non profits advocacy organizations and other groups
number of different titles for this role are in use internationally but in the usa and europe ombudsman om buds and ombudsperson are most common
when the first organizational ombudsman offices in america were created in the late the ombudsman title was ut even though the organizational role was structured quite differently than the classical swedish model
when began my om buds career in there were many passionate discussions taking place during the merger process of the university and coll om buds association and the ombudsman association toa
one issue of debate was what the new combined organizational ombudsman professional association should call itself
as part of this discussion journal of the international ombudsman association ras ch the question arose about whether the new name would keep the man in ombudsman
those in favor of keeping the man contended that this name would match the swedish word which had already been adopted by several other countries and organizations
they felt using the word ombudsman would better position the organization for international acceptance and growth
it was lai med that because ombudsman is swedish word we should not attach the same meaning to the man suffix as we do in english because it was gender neutral
arguments against the title ombudsman were focused on the unnecessary and gendered ending of the word
in particular some women om buds felt the title did not represent them appropriately and symbolized obsolete patriarchal and repressive cultural traditions that should be replaced
by this point in american history number of professions police fire mail etc
had already dropped their male gendered suffixes for this reason
in fact and several organizational om buds offices had already decided to drop the man to make their title gender neutral
when and merged this issue was eventually resolved in favor of keeping the man and the new organization was named the international ombudsman association
while there was not unanimous agreement about this decision among the membership the controversy about the name has drifted into he background as flurry of other concerns emerged for our young profession
is there any reason to bring the man conversation back to the forefront of issues for the to consider
been told by more than one person that bec ombudsman is swedish word the man in ombudsman mean the same thing it does in english
since learned from native swedish speakers that man does mean the same thing in swedish as it does in english
it refers to the male ender
ombudsman is gendered term in both languages
in any event ombudsman is now an english word and even if it gendered term in swedish it is in english which is the primary language of most members and constituents
imagine what ld have happened if king charles xii had created position called om buds woman in
would our organization have embraced the word om buds woman as it has with ombudsman
even if woman in swedish mean what it means in english om buds woman not have survived the cut
this is because the men in the profession would never have accepted title with female gendered suffix
so why do we expect women in the to accept the opposite scenario
suspect that it never crossed the mind of king charles xii that woman would ever be appointed to the office he was creating
for him and his century naming the position ombudsman undoubtedly generated no controversy whatsoever because there was no possibility of woman serving in the role
as recent cultural movements like me too have powerfully demonstrated there has been centuries long oppression of the rights of women in numerous realms including under the law in education and at work
keeping the man in ombudsman lea our organization behind the curve of this important cultural awakening and evolution
in addition there is growing societal awareness of the need to broaden the categories for gender identity beyond male and female
many forward thinking inst it ut io ns are making changes to actively acknowledge and support previously mar gi na liz ed or persecuted individuals
these are individuals who one would hope would feel comfortable seeking assistance in om buds offices about concerns related to fairness bullying discrimination and inequity
the should be leading efforts to improve access and journal of the international ombudsman association ras ch acceptance of om buds offices as valuable resource for transgender ed and other mar gi na liz ed populations
by continuing to embrace the word ombudsman the name rem ai ns incongruent with those efforts and unfortunately demonstrates lack of sensitivity to women and other groups experiencing gender related inequities
all of our corporate educational and governmental institutions have long history of being male do mi nat ed
in our role as organizational om buds we often work with complaints involving subtle or blatant gender discrimination and harassment and in the vast majority of these cases women are raising complaints about how men are treating them
it is ironic and unfortunate that the international association that created and oversees the ethical standards for the offices these women turn to for help is gn ed with maleness by its name
one easily implemented resolution is the use of the terms om buds or ombudsperson as alternatives to ombudsman and many organizational om buds offices already do this
the american bar association has an om buds committee and the association of conflict resolution has an om buds sect io prefer om buds over ombudsperson as see no need for adding suffix to alert us that the om buds is also person
for example we feel need to use terms like lawyer person teacher person or doctor person
unfortunately om buds is not an easy word to use in english and people often get confused expression on their face when they hear it
it is mispronounced frequently and people new to the word usually mumble sheepishly when they try to say it
another problem is that om buds is singular noun that ends in
none of th options for making it plural possessive or plural possessive seem fully satisfactory
despite these hassles the newness challenges and confusion around the word are not insurmountable barriers and somehow these challenges appropriately mirror the cur rent dynamic state of the organizational om buds profession
if the left ombudsman behind and changed its name to the international om buds association it would signal developmental shift for our profession as we adapt to new age
it behooves us to remember that as organizational om buds we are young emerging profession that was initially inspired in certain ways by its swedish predecessor but that has since evolved its own unique identity
and while there would be predictable hassles con ne cte with altering the name our association has used proudly for the past several years shift to the international om buds association would still use the acronym and believe there would be significant confusion within or outside of the profess ion about the change
time for the international ombudsman association to take lesson from king charles playbook and rebrand its meatball
it is possible to honor the roots of our profession and also honor the emerging realities of our prese nt moment in history
see this as an option that has been on the table for long time and needs to be considered seriously again
my recommendation is that the board solicit input from the membership on this issue through vote or survey and take action in accordance with the majority opinion

om buds academic om buds student success journal of the international ombudsman association interpersonal conf li ct and academic su cc ess campus survey with pr ac ti ca applications for cad emic introduction much of the work of the academic om buds regard listening to and facilitating resolution assistance for visitors dealing with interpersonal conflict
about half of all visits to an om buds office involve concerns regarding relationships with peers and those charged with the res to evaluate their performance so za ko va ck
moreover even when issues raised with an om buds fall into different category they often emerge from an initial complaint about interpersonal discord
as result on day today basis academic om buds devote much of their time listening to con related concerns providing one on one conflict coaching serving as third party mediators and referring their visitors to appropriate support services gad lin
over time trends may surface that connect these interpersonal issues to larger ys tem ic ones
when viewed as whole the interpersonal concerns of visitors to an om buds office may point to the unmet conflict resolution needs of an entire group or community
they may also highlight common practices or policies that precipitate or ag gr av ate the interpersonal dispute
finally they can signify hostile environment toxic subculture and the inappropriate actions of one individual or group of bad actors
when trends such as these emerge om buds are often the first to identify connect ions between interpersonal discord and organizational dysfunction wagner ro we
through their formal annual reports and informal conversations academic om buds assist leadership in developing expectations and prior it izing services for con flic resolution sch neck so sa
key to identifying and describing trending concerns is the effective utilization of data bark at and visitor tracking data is most commonly used for that purpose
careful deployment of can provide compelling descriptions of trends from the point of view
however the genera liz ability of is quite limited
such data cannot for example speak to the concerns of constituents who have not yet visited an om buds ff ice or how the experiences of those who seek om buds assistance compare with those who do not
survey data are ideal for addressing the question of prevalence but few om buds programs have the expertise or resources to design and implement survey project because many om buds are solo practitioners without research budgets they rely upon the research findings of others ro we blo ch
historically research within and for the om buds community has tended to be qualitative in the form of his tori ca analyses eg claus sen in depth interview eg le vine finely carter or ethnographic field studies eg emerson harrison mor rill
while qualitative research projects like these have advanced theoretical understand in gs their ability to establish the prevalence of practices needs or experiences are limited
in contrast survey data can provide snapshots of concerns in the aggregate identify the needs and experiences of those who have not yet visited an om buds office
such survey results can be deployed to improve outreach to under served constituent groups inform prevention training programming and suggest effective intervention strategies
the preponderance of om buds scholarship about conflict has been from point of view
less has been written from the standpoint of those who visit the offices of those practitioners
our understanding of the experiences and expectations of actual and potential visitors to an om buds office is largely anecdotal and analyses are often limited to internal tracking data
the project described in this article seeks to address this gap by posing series of questions focused on the needs of student constituents specifically their experiences of interpersonal conflict and efforts to resolve them
how many disputes or disagreements does the journal of the international ombudsman association average student experience in an academic year
when conflict arises how much does it impact their daily lives and academic performance
who or what offices do students turn to when they seek help in resolving their disputes or disagreements
finally when students seek help with interpersonal conflicts what characteristics of third party assistance do they prefer
the following pages pursue these questions by reporting key find in gs from campus wide survey of undergraduates attending university where conflict resolution services are abundant and diverse but access to the om buds program is limited
the subsequent report is presented in four sections
the next section describes the origins the focus of its inquiry and how team of student researchers worked together to realize it
section two reviews the relevant literature to provide rationale for the methodology and describes how the data were ol lect ed and analyzed
the third section presents the key findings and the final section discusses the limitations and practical applications for academic om buds
project origin the idea for this project was born in special topics course for criminology and criminal justice majors called alternative dispute resolution
the first author designed the course after serving three year term in the dual role of faculty member and coordinator of the faculty om bud program where faculty brought to the office wide range of concerns teachers and advisors commonly asked for assistance in dealing with conflicts they had with students as well as conflicts between their students
in many cases the students involved visited the fop upon invitation and either participated in mediation or were referred to another office or program that offered conflict resolution services specifically for students
inspired by the experience the first author developed the course as ea ns to help students hone their conflict management skills
the students enrolled in bring to the course vibrant and diverse stock of common knowledge informed by their direct and highly personal experience of conflict
the course addr esse and challenges their knowledge by exposing them to scholarly theories and research about it
over the years about majors have completed nine sections of
students appreciate how the course material resonates with the challenges they face in everyday life
in particular they find immediate application concerning their struggles to understand and deal with the stress of interpersonal conflict with other students
consequently course assignments involve connecting the macro universal principles about conflict and resolution to the micro the particularities of lived experiences of roommate troubles dating discord and disagreements between team and club members
for many this approach catalyzes personal academic and professional growth in the management of interpersonal conflict
each semester students work in teams to complete term projects that showcase their expertise on an issue or topic relevant to the course
designed to meet the requirements for the liberal studies capstone experience many of these term projects become significant service learning initiatives
students have for example served the campus community by conducting conflict management workshops for students living in re side nt halls greek life council members student executive council members peer mentors and athletes
on day teams have provided street clinics to help those in romantic relationships resolve conflicts with their loved ones
ts like these help fill in the gaps of the conflict resolution services system
due to budgetary constraints in the university om buds office charter was discontinued and in faculty om buds program was established
journal of the international ombudsman association in team of five graduating majors led by the third author decided to serve the campus by surveying the experiences of students about the types and consequences of interpersonal conflict among undergraduates
in brainstorming the focus the team drew upon their own life experiences to posit that interpersonal conflict between students is common experience that significantly impacts th quality of daily life and academic performance
reflecting on the re occurring themes of class discussions the team felt that because conflicts with university personnel more often become newsworthy astor carroll taylor san dem an the significance of interpersonal conflicts between students is too often underappreciated or overlooked altogether
the team began their investigation by defining key terms
drawing upon assigned readings the team defined conflict as as possible to include disputes disagreements or differences of opinions between individuals that often but do not always create sense of discord disquiet or stress
interpersonal conflicts were defined as those occurring between peers and in the context of relationships that involved regular or ongoing personal interaction ie friends loved ones teammates and roommates
from here the team turned their attention to operational izing the concept of academic success
based on review of the mission and purpose statements for variety of student success programs the team defined academic success as the achievement of personal social and career development arrived at through academic engagement
while benchmarks of student uc cess vary across programs the two most commonly used are the successful completion of course and the timely progression to graduation see for example north dakota student success collaborative at
in order to support the achievement of these larger goals student success centers provide resources to achieve behaviors like regular class attendance effective study and note taking timely submission of work and classroom activity en gag eme nt good example is pit ts burgh student success program at
with these definitions in hand the team searched the scholarly literature for relevant res ear ch
while they discovered numerous research reports regarding conflicts between students and their teachers and advisors this phase of the project revealed gap in the literature regarding conflicts between students and the impact of those conflicts academic success
relevant research an research design the team began their review of published research with studies of student student conflict at the college level
they found that majority of the articles focus on conflict that occurs within the context of evaluative relationships ie conflict between students and those with authority to evaluate their academic success teachers internship supervisors or graduate advisors
of those the results of one study suggest that family and friends can play positive role in the management of conflict with those who evaluate academic success
survey of international graduate students and faculty supervisors reported that advisors were more likely than students to feel conflicts had been cess fully resolved
interestingly of the students surveyed said they would talk with family or friend before talking with their advisor department head or dean of student life adrian taylor noels tis ch ler
similar survey of grad students found that instructors and advisors who appeared to be competent conflict managers were more likely to be trusted to assist in conflict intervention or management pun ya nu nt carter wrench
third study found that more than half of he participants said the conflict between students and their preceptors was frequent and said such conflict journal of the international ombudsman association impeded academic growth man ch ur may rick
finally an assessment of conflict management training for graduate teaching assistants foun the conflict management styles of their supervisors was related to their success brock man ba su
the team also found few reports focused exclusively on the interpersonal conflicts of students
in survey of students from institutions of higher education for example of the respondents visited campus clinics for help in dealing with inter per so conflicts and ranked the problem of conflict second only to mood difficulties kru mr ie newton kim
furthermore the survey found that interpersonal conflict problems were often embedded in reports of mood regulation eating disorders per for man ce anxiety and life satisfaction
although not study of conflict per se study measuring the impact of stress on student success reported that more than half of the undergraduates who participated in survey claimed conflicts with roommates and conflicts with romantic partners were stressful ross
another survey of female undergraduates found statistically significant correlation between conflict and mood regulation crea sey ker shaw boston
in that study those with secure relationships with friends and romantic partners were less likely to report negative conflict management experiences and those with negative conflict management experiences were more likely to struggle with mood re gu lation
in di paola and colleagues surveyed the experiences of undergraduates regarding variety of relational categories and found that the closeness of the relationship was positively related to the intensity of the interpersonal conflict
the emotional impact of conflicts with friends roommates and loved ones for example were more intense than those with strangers di paola
few studies reported on the consequences when interpersonal conflict is ill managed or allowed to escalate
in for example mcdonald and asher analyzed the responses of college students to series of interpersonal conflict vignettes and found that emotional intensity correlated with revenge as conflict resolution strategy and that students we re more likely to endorse hostile goals with romantic partners than with friends or roommates
similarly qualitative analysis of student accounts of roommate troubles found that in the early stages of discord students go along to get along but as roommate troubles escalate students increasingly embrace antagonistic strategies emerson
finally in more recent survey of high school seniors court ain and found students capable of perspective taking were more to choose conflict resolution strategies that would improve the relationship while students prone to impulsivity were more likely to adopt conflict management strategies likely to damage the relationship
when viewed together the results of these stud suggest that peer conflict ie disputes and disagreements with another student can have as significant an impact on the college experience as evaluative conflict ie disputes and disagreements with teachers advisors coaches mentors and other campus authorities responsible for assessing academic success
the review further suggests that not all peer relationships are the same and differences among them can color the character of the conflict and therefore the impact it has on life satisfaction and academic performance
specifically the amount of intimacy or closeness in the relationship could be significant factor in how students experience conflicts with each other
inspired by their own experiences and informed by the relevant literature the team posed the following research questions for further investigation how prevalent is peer conflict among college and university students
how does the prevalence of conflicts between students compare with conflicts students have with university personnel
what is the impact of conflict on efforts to achieve academic success
journal of the international ombudsman association what role does intimacy play in the conflict experience
whom students turn to when they seek help in resolving their interpersonal conflict
what characteristics of third party intervention do students associate with resolution satisfaction
at this point the team drafted series of forced choice questions de signed to describe the prevalence of interpersonal conflicts among undergraduates the perceived impact of those conflicts have on daily life and academic success and to identify the types of personnel that undergraduates seek help from as well as the pes of conflict intervention they prefer
because the research literature review did not uncover replicable questionnaire items the team designed pre tested and revised an original item questionnaire see appendix
the items are organized by four key concepts
serving as validity hedge the th item on the questionnaire was open ended inviting respondents to share any ad di ti on al information of their choosing
once exemption from review was obtained the team deployed non probability sampling approach that combined the techniques of geographic cluster sampling and quota sampling kal ton
seven high traffic area on campus were identified ie classroom buildings libraries computer commons union parking lots shuttle bus stations etc
and team member was assigned to each station
for one morning or afternoon during week in april each team member randomly selected potential participants from those who passed by
the final sample of undergraduates was large enough and diverse enough to support statistical analyses of the resulting responses
key findings at the conclusion of the data coll ec ti on phase group of research interns led by the second author joined the team
using the statistical package for the social sciences sp ss they completed data entry ran the statistics and created graphical displays for course credit
demographics of the respondents were female were nonwhite and were in state students
according to the national center for education statistics this profile is typical for undergraduates enrolled in four year public university in the us during
majors from all the colleges at this university were represented although when compared to institutional data the science majors were slightly over sampled and english majors were slightly under sampled
the sample was also toward traditionally aged freshmen and sophomores in that the average age was not quite years old
sixty seven percent of the participants lived in residence halls and of them shared living quarters with at least two other students
when view ed as whole these demographics suggest that there were ample opportunities for those who participated in the study to have experienced conflicts with other students in variety of circumstances and settings
conflicts with un ive personnel the review of news media and scholarly lite rat ure revealed concern about conflicts between students and university personnel
consequently four questionnaire items sought to capture the amount and types of conflict the respondents had with university
only of the respondents said they had ever had dispute or disagreement about university policy or had ever taken issue with the decisions of representative of the university
those journal of the international ombudsman association respondents were given list of programs or departments and asked to check all that was relevant
the most common choices were parking services academic advising and class grades
similarly they were given list of six common issues and asked to identify all that applied and the most common answers were similar parking and instruction academic support
finally he students who reported disagreements with university personnel or disputes regarding university policies and practices were given list of nine ot en ti al academic consequences and asked to rate on five point scale the seriousness of the impact figure
figure seriousness of conflict with university personnel on academic success while the overall average rating of seriousness for all nine consequences was just above or serious at it is important to note that all respondents indicated that as result of their conflict with university personnel they had to drop or withdraw from class and of them claimed their graduations were delayed
conflicts with other students in contrast to conflicts involving university personnel conflicts wit other students were common
of the students who completed the questionnaire said they had experienced at least one conflict with another student within year of their participation in the survey
these respondents reported total disputes or disagreements with other students averaging disputes per respondent
approximately one third of the respondents generated about half of these reported conflicts thus for these students interpersonal conflict may be common feature of college life
when asked to estimate the number of conflicts experienced within the last year one respondent wrote and another wrote many to
in the open comment section of the survey freshman further ela bo rated with my roommate happen every single
moreover rising senior explained every class always one group member who wants to make the rest of us
because the review of published research indicated that the am of intimacy is factor affecting conflict experience the team took closer look at the distribution of reported seriousness of impact impact had to drop or withdraw from class thought about transferring to another school unable to meet class deadline had to delay my graduation did not do my best work on an assignment unable to concentrate on schoolwork had to miss class unable to perform well at an on campus job thought about dropping out of college not serious at all very serious journal of the international ombudsman association conflicts across continuum of intimacy defined by seven types of relationships
at the low end of the continuum are strang ers toward the middle are relationships with acquaintances ie teammates and classmates and at the high end are relationships with friends roommates and romantic partners
figure displays two distributions across the continuum
the first dis tri bu ti on is the number of respondents who reported disagreement or is pu te with another student for seven cat eg or labeled as relationship type
the second distribution is the number of disagreements or disputes those respondents reported labeled as conflicts
so for example within one year of the survey respondents reported total of conflicts with student who was considered friend
figure conflicts with other students figure shows that the preponderance of the stu dent to student conflicts occurred at the high end of the intimacy continuum ie friends roommates or romantic partners this category includes boyfriends girlfriends and spouses
in contrast just of the conflicts involved acquaintances
teammates classmates and co workers for example and strangers
interestingly sizable minority of these respondents reported conflicts across the entire continuum
for these students conflict may be an endemic feature of everyday social interaction
in light of the literature review the survey included items that could assess the impact of conflicts across the intimacy continuum
thus those who reported disputes or disagreements with other students were then asked to rate on five point scale the seriousness of the impact of their conflicts on daily life by each of the seven types of relationships
overall the average impact on daily life was only
thus on daily basis in the words of one respondent disputes or disagreements with other students were big
in fact in their open comments few respondents said they felt the conflict in close relationship was normal or even healthy
one female respondent for example said clearing of the air makes us roommates get along
respondents who had experienced one or more conflicts with another student within year of the survey were asked to rate the seriousness of the impact of those conflicts on the sa me list of nine academic consequences that were provided to those who reported conflicts with academic personnel
figure compares two distributions the average ratings of the seriousness of impact of student conflicts and the average ratings of the seriousness of conflicts with university personnel
stranger teammate classmate coworker friend roommate romantic partner number of responses relationship type relationship type conflicts total journal of the international ombudsman association figure seriousness of the consequences of conflict on academic performance about the academic consequences of conflicts of other students the range of average ratings for each category was or somewhere between and
the highest ratings were not do my best to meet class deadline and unable to concentrate on school
while the most serious consequence of conflict with university personnel was had to drop or withdraw from class the most serious consequence of conflict with another student was about dropping out of
in the open comments respondent explained that by had caused him her to consider an athletic and transferring to another university
dispute resolution ssi sta the review of the research revealed gap in the literature concerning resolution assistance seeking
for this reason the final section of the questionnaire included eight items designed to gather information about the efforts at ee king assistance in resolving their interpersonal conflicts with students as well as their perceptions of differing models of conflict intervention
those who had reported experiencing disputes or disagreements with anyone associated with the university ie university personnel or other tu dents were given list of potential third parties that included variety of university representatives for example instructors counselors and student life representatives as well as personal contacts ie students parents and lawyers and asked to indicate if they had contacted any of them for assistance
of the who completed the survey only said they had asked for help from any university representative
only eight of the types of university ep resent at iv es were selected
figure displays th percent age of responses for each of the eight categories
thought about dropping out of college had to drop or withdraw from class had to delay my graduation did not do my best on an assignment unable to meet class deadline thought about transferring to another school unable to perform well at an on campus job unable to concentrate on schoolwork had to miss class seriousness of impact impact conflict wot her student sn conflict wun iv er si typer son ne ln very serious not serious at all journal of the international ombudsman association figure third parties contacted for conflict assistance given the number of roommate disputes reported in this survey it is surprising that less than of the respondents sought help from resident hall staff member
equally surprising is the fact that the number of contacts with academic personnel ie faculty members and academic advisors exceeds that of non academic per resident hall staff coaches legal aid other students parents and personal lawyers
about fourth of the respond en ts who answered this question contacted faculty members and asked their academic advisors to help them find resolution
in the open comments one freshman explained that an insensitivity to his her plight in dealing with an abusive boyfriend increased his her stress
the respondent explained teachers want to hear it and
in contrast an upperclassman was that his her professor provided the opportunity to make up an exam missed due to late night argument with boyfriend
the next set of questions sought information about the perceived outcomes of res po efforts in resolving conflicts with either university personnel or with other students
when asked if their most recent disagreement or dispute had been resolved only said yes
the rest indicated they were either still in conflict es ol uti on was in progress or unsure if the conflict had been resolved
respondents who had sought help from university personnel were then asked to rate on five point scale their satisfaction with three elements the process outcome and effort
even though respondents reported contacting university personnel for conflict resolution assistance only respondents choose to rate these items
with one meaning satisfied at and five meaning the overall av er age rating for was or
in an open comment one student expressed dissatisfaction with the efforts of peer attempts to fac il it at resolution of group project conflict and two other respondents described the interventions of resid en life hall workers student workers as and
while most college and university campuses provide students with third party conflict resolution assistance there is significant diversity in the types of models that are deployed
the academic om buds model for example emphasizes neutrality
those without an om buds office may rely upon university personnel who have received advanced training in mediation advocacy or conflict coaching
finally some campuses may operate peer volunteer mediation programs
missing in the literature reviewed were efforts to assess resolution assistance preferences
to that end the questionnaire included three questions that sought to learn more legal aid resident hall staff coaches mentors other students office staff parents lawyers academic advisor faculty percent of total response third parties contacted journal of the international ombudsman association about preferences students might have when seeking third arty to facilitate conflict resolution
the team identified three qualities of third party neutrality professionalism and voluntariness could impact satisfaction with the resolution process or outcome
neutrality was ope rationalized as who does not decide right or wrong but who works to make sure the process and outcome is fair for all
professionalism was characterized as with special education or training in the facilitation of conflict
the thir was defined as peer who draws upon personal experience and some training to help facilitate fair
all respondents regardless of whether or not they had experienced conflict within year of the study were asked to ef lect on their most recent dispute or disagreement and rate the importance of each characteristic for achieving satisfactory resolution
respondents rated the importance of each characteristic on scale of one to five with one being very import an at and five being
while all three characteristics were deemed important for satisfactory resolution the help of trained volunteer was rated as slightly more important than the presence of either neutral party or professional resolution facilitation
discussion while interest in the mp ir ic al study of tu dent conflict has grown in recent years the focus of attention has been on conflicts in the context of evaluative relationships ie teachers and advisors
similarly cursory review of recent news media suggests conflicts with university personnel seem to be more newsworthy than conflicts between students see for example carroll taylor san dem an
an empirical stud of student student conflict has been predominately qualitative and limited to conflicts between roommates
drawing upon their direct experiences as college students the team that pursued this project saw gap in the literature and endeavored to address it
what they were able to discover supports the widespread view interpersonal conflict can affect the quality of social life
however the project goes further to suggest that interpersonal conflict may impact academic success
when viewed together these insights suggest assisting students in managing and resolving their interpersonal conflicts is neither student support issue nor an academic issue
as such effective conflict management and resolution services should be ed accordingly
thus to maximize their effectiveness those who assist students on the side of the ie resident life staff diversity and disability advisors clinicians etc need to assess and then take into consideration the ex te nt to which everyday conflicts over seemingly inconsequential issues like food cleanliness money owed and parking can impact academic performance
similarly those who labor on the side of the faculty mentors tutors and academic adv is ors would do well to remember that as they are often the first to see the effects of interpersonal conflict on academic performances kafka
academic om buds practitioners are uniquely positioned to facilitate collaborations between student support and academic personnel and help them assess their shared need to provide effective conflict assistance and coordinate the efforts of all those who to the social lives and academic endeavors of college students
as conflict resolution experts academic om buds practitioners can play leading roles in brainstorming and implementing effective conflict management and conflict resolution protocols
this re port points to range of possible preliminary actions
before discussing those first steps it is important to knowledge the limitations imposed by the inevitable challenges that characterize student research
while the demographics of the final sample were similar to those of the institution and national population the extent to which it represents those populations is incalculable kal ton
journal of the international ombudsman association therefore while suggestive the results are not conclusive
future replications could however explore the extent to which the findings can be generalized to other campuses
furthermore the small size of the final sample resulted in comparison groups too small to meet the assumptions necessary for confidence in statistical tests of differences between an sw ers to multiple questions
relatedly although the five point barometric scales that were used do meet the assumptions for valid associative models insufficient variation did not meet the muster for regression modeling fox
as res ult the ability to predict the extent to which interpersonal conflicts or the amount of intimacy of those conflicts could impact either academic success or preferences for conflict resolution was beyond the scope of this study
despite these limitations the descriptive statistics reported in this article do provide some insights for academic om buds work
while the charters of academic om buds programs vary considerably from one campus to another there are opportunities to apply elements of this to support the efforts of academic om buds practitioners
on daily basis student om buds spend much of the day listening to concerns investigating the facts identifying the issues and brainstorming strategies for resolving them
for those who work dire ct ly with students the key findings of this survey could inform the development of series of questions that could support deeper reflection regarding program goals and best practices
for example this survey found that small group of students app ea red to be conflict
if visitor data show similar trends the ability to identify these types of students early and assess to what extent their magnetism is due to circumstance or conflict style could lead to more efficient and effective intervent ions
doing so could reduce the number of and perhaps relieve the conflict intervention loads of the other programs across the campus that are working with the same high conflict students
similarly the findings revealed number of ot where the number of student conflicts was particularly high
this insight might lead to deeper consideration of how visitor tracking data could be collected or organized to identify high traffic areas
while the findings could spark con vers at io direct application of the instrument used to collect the data could capture trends that visitor tracking forms are unable to capture
campus wide survey using the questionnaire could be deployed to determine the extent to which students ar effectively utilizing an om buds program
if for example the survey trends are dramatically different from visitor trends an om buds program might need to reassess their outreach initiatives or take closer look at the menu of conflict resolution ser vi provided to students
while the thought of launching campus wide survey could seem overwhelming the initiative offers glimpse into the power of student research
by sponsoring team of supervised student researchers by for exam pl supporting service learning class projects thesis research or field research internships an academic om buds office can obtain social science data that could fill in the gaps left by visitor tracking data thus taking program assessment and budget ju st if ic at ion processes to the next level of sophistication
such participation could also raise campus profile and add value by directly contributing to their teaching and research missions
the findings in this report suggest possible connection between student conflict and academic success
in the past institutions have placed the management of student conflict issues in the student life or student support
as result the preponderance of resources and training for conflict resolution was dealt to personnel in those silos
while academic personnel like faculty and advisors receive support for classroom management training for helping students with their interpersonal conflicts has not been high priority
yet mos of the students in this study contacted teachers and advisors for help
this suggests that faculty and mentors may serve as when students feel overwhelmed by the conflicts they have with other students
academic om buds practitioners ar uniquely positioned to raise awareness about the role that journal of the international ombudsman association academic personnel can play in helping their students
for starters om buds practitioners can prioritize specialized training in effective interpersonal conflict intervention for new faculty and academic advisor hires
further they can facilitate conversation across and collaboration between the and silos
sharing the findings from the survey reported in this study or the results of its replication could be the first step supporting more integrated approach to the management of student interpersonal conflicts
finally the students who participated in this survey noted that interpersonal conflicts had negatively impacted their academic efforts
the recent rise student success movement has provoked significant rethinking of what constitutes success the factors that undermine and facilitate it and what institutions can do to support it konrad
as result many colleges and universities are making student success programming high priority
such programs provide diverse menu of services that attend to the mental social and intellectual needs of students
the experiences reported in this study suggests that conflict resolution services could bo ls ter the efforts of student success centers and programs
partnership between academic om buds offices and their institutions student success initiatives might be worth considering
by pooling resources such partnership could support the establishment of peer mediation program or the development of noncredit interpersonal conflict management class or training series geared toward the specific needs of students
conclusion in just one semester and with minimal resources team of students de sig ne and implemented survey of undergraduate conflict experiences
inspired by their personal experiences and sense that the research to date has not adequately addressed those experiences they designed an original questionnaire
while the genera liza bi li of the findings is limited by the practical constraints of the project they provide insights for future investigation and practical application
when viewed as whole the results suggest that interpersonal conflict is ubiquitous experience for coll students and that most of them are most of the time successfully managing them
however some students either due to circumstance or to their conflict management styles have an uncommon amount of conflict in their lives or struggle with conflicts that have negatively colored their college experience
as experts in conflict management and dispute resolution academic om buds are uniquely positioned to raise awareness about and meaningfully address the interpersonal conflict concerns of college and uni students
this article has aspired to provide academic om buds with ideas and resources to address the conflict needs of their students

higher education ombudsperson journal of the international ombudsman association this article suggests that the faculty ombudsperson serves in pivotal role to preserve the coexistence of academic freedom and civility in the university environment
in order to accomplish this role the faculty ombudsperson needs to have good grasp on academic ed om peer review tenure and shared governance issues which affect the faculty climate kea sh ly
all four components are at the core of the mission in the academy
academic freedom is the freedom for faculty to teach without external con tr ol in their area of expertise and includes the freedom of the student to learn alt bach
it defines freedom in which faculty can teach study research or communicate facts in the university environment or outside without being targeted for up pression job loss or discipline by the university
academic freedom guarantees faculty to explore and express ideas no matter how controversial or inconvenient to political groups or authority figures inside and outside the university po ch
fundamental to defending academic freedom is the critical role of peer review hamilton
peer review describes process by which faculty work together to assess and improve each teaching and research
in this situation all per sp are presented and vetted in order to explore and broaden knowledge kea sh ly and
peer review is the process by which the academic freedom of faculty is critiqued and challenged as feedback on faculty research and teaching are being made
tenure is an accomplishment by which any person who is retained as full time faculty member beyond specified period of probationary service may not thereafter be dismissed without adequate cause brown
in fact faculty tenure is not only faculty right to due process but entails process by which the university confirms that the academic freedom to pursue any academic research without the fear of discipline nor the concern of repercussions is made
in this wa tenure provides the faculty member with protection from retaliation for unpopular perspectives that are counter to the climate of the university
academic freedom requires governance system in which faculty expertise determines how institutional si ons are being made with regard to academic matters
sometimes it is possible for faculty members to make decisions that disregard the academic freedom of other faculty members ger ber
shared governance is that process by which various groups of at the university share in key decision making roles often through elected representatives and allows for certain groups at the university to exercise primary responsibility in certain areas or issues of concern
shared governance is process by hi ch balance between faculty and staff participation in planning and decision making processes on the one hand exists with administrative accountability on the other olson per ley
it refers to the degree to which faculty in decisions around academic policies programs budget concerns and hiring messer
or perhaps another example would be to form joint faculty administration committee in order to implement assessment initiatives for the various admin is tr at ive and academic departments
in this way both faculty and staff are held accountable for implementing this process
particularly all faculty share role in the shared governance process and generally some constituencies or person are accountable for implementing this process
academic freedom peer review tenure and shared governance are principles that are impacted by the university mission and promote climate in which ideas are subjected to rigorous scrutiny and critique kea sh ly and
in such climate dissent is valued and dialogue and debate are encouraged
ideas are challenged discussed and further elaboration of the expressed ideas are welcomed while other faculty may exercise authority through shared governance for example in knowledge of these ideas
it is important to view these dialogues and challenges as part of the general culture of the university and it is expected that such dialogues are discussed in civil manner
journal of the international ombudsman association coexistence of academic freedom and civil when academic freedom is used by faculty members to say anything they want with disregard to the actions of other colleagues or to exercise abusive and abrupt behavior like shouting at colleagues denouncing students and administrators or bypassing professional duties question arises regarding whether our peers may want to grant this person who is speaking in this fashion platform to hear such discourse
this includes granting such colleague tenure or promotion or viewing this sp ee ch positively in matters of peer review or shared governance
even in the case of tenured faculty it is assumed have an obligation to exercise caution in what we say and how we say ol sen
this is significant because in the process of app lying dialogue and debate in the academy insensitive behavior that displays lack of disregard to other points of view can result in the exclusion or silencing of the person who exhibited the insensitive behavior
civility is an action that helps to preserve the norms for mutual respect acknowledgement and concern in the workplace cloud
way to disagree without demonizing spencer jackson
faculty civility is fundamental to success in teaching and research as well as college and department service which are all crucial in attaining tenure
in fact some constituencies at the university claim that exhibiting civility should be an additional requirement to receiving tenure per tn oy
however adding civility to the list of tenure requirements could suppress free expression dialogue and discourse and thereby threaten the academic freedom of the faculty member going for tenure pert noy
this means as incivility in te rf er es with the faculty academic freedom incivility can disrupt work patterns turn away potential collaborators in research and college service where colleagues do not appreciate hasty behaviors and interference with productive work pears on nd ers on and po rath
un tenured faculty are often discouraged from questioning or challenging administrative decisions policy initiatives or policy violations
in this case civility is used to stifle and punish free speech which then affects the of shared governance issues at the university when the university setting involves free exchange of ideas
however if disagreements in university setting are in spirit of mutual respect and then the academic freedom speech at the university implies the use of dignity courtesy and temperateness of
th or ne mcdonald stockton and lan drum
in this way academic freedom and civility coexist
incivility and workplace bullying on continuum in th academy when acts of incivility are left unchallenged they can possibly escalate to bullying
chairpersons or academic vice presidents can demand rapid decisions and around the clock interactions for resolving issues heavy workloads and poor sc he du lin and can control by wielding power through exploitation of others
these are some factors that exist in the organizational climate and contribute to bullying
the organizational climate of higher education allows bullying to thrive because of com petitio adversity and political tactics or more specifically aggressive tactics which often encourage faculty to climb the ladder from un tenured professor to full professor in more forceful way far key and
bullying is behavior that is anted and unwarranted pattern of repeated behaviors that generally escalate if not recognized and dealt with quickly and which humiliates excludes demeans offends and intimidates and has detrimental effect on the target mc cul loch
imp le ment ing of bullying would suffice by providing definition of bullying range of options that confront and deal with the bullying behavior and consequences for its occurrence mc cul loch
journal of the international ombudsman association the one who exhibits the original uncivil behavior gets heightened sense of power as others ignore the unchallenged critique of coworkers in front of others the downplay of accomplishments of co workers or the yelling and screaming at targets in front of others
incivility can start fo example as single incident like eye rolling mocking interruption or denial of co accomplishments and before it is apparent the mockery and eye rolling turn into constant critique and the interruption and denial turn into ostracism reoccurring on more continuous basis over period of time
bullying then becomes repeated unwanted behavior directed toward colleague or colleagues by an individual or individuals who has perceived power and is intended to harm the targeted coll ea gue or colleagues
this behavior results in negative impact on the targets mat tice
in this way both incivility and workplace bullying then lead to physical and mental symptoms in the target and subsequently lead to higher turnover rate ower productivity and potential lawsuits
hence it is important for higher education institutions to address these incivility and bullying issues and encourage positive climate so that the academic mission more effectively reflects acad emic freedom peer review tenure and shared governance
addressing incivility and workplace bullying at the university some of the processes for addressing incivility and bullying behavior in higher education can include any of the following far key kea sh ly instituting code of professional conduct that clearly indicates which behaviors are acceptable reinforcing positive college climate for faculty administration and staff creating interventions and workshops on eradicating bullying and encouraging campus civility creating an anti bullying healthy workplace policy establishing effective mechanisms for monitoring internal conflict and establishing more efficient communications department and ol lege wide
role of the ombudsperson as an agent to tackle incivility and workplace bullying however sometimes the target of incivil or bullying behaviors is so overwhelmed that the person does not know what to do or where to go morse
the development of model to address incivility and bullying behaviors at the academy could include the faculty ombudsperson in central role who works with the university constituency in collaborative role
this means that the ombudsperson acts as who works collaboratively to develop and implement cultural change effort by addressing within the academy while being neutral and confidential to target of workplace bullying
essentially he existence of faculty ombudsperson can provide faculty with prompt and strictly confidential way to resolve any conflicts complaints or disagreements when the re are conflicts with the department chairperson or academic vice president
the ombudsperson will assist faculty with work rel at ed difficulties or any interpersonal co on the job
also the ombudsperson can help faculty identify options for resolving issues of concern and will help maintain civility and thus academic freedom in the context of existing mechanisms at the college in an impartial manner
in this way he ombudsperson reports to someone at the academy who under sta that the ombudsperson will serve as bridge between existing journal of the international ombudsman association conflicts and options for resolution and whose job description has the full co opera ti on of all staff and administrators
moreover the ombudsperson can work as change agent at the university helping to implement positive working climate at the university
it is important for the ombudsperson to be perceived in way that does not nd ermine the neutrality credibility and effectiveness of the job
behaviors on the job like screaming cursing isolation banging on tables or anything that violates dignity and described as uncivil behaviors can be tackled confidentially by the ombudsperson
if these behaviors occur in the realm of workplace bullying repeated over period of time like weeks or months the ombudsperson can develop strategies to tackle such behaviors as well
what constitutes un civil behavior to one person may not appear uncivil to another person where differences in culture gender personality or life experiences may impact on the existence of civility or bullying in particular situation
in order to preserve the essence of the university as place for dialogue and debate through academic freedom tenure peer re view and shared governance the ombudsperson must maintain mutual respect for all concerned
this is done in such way that all perspectives are heard con trovers are discussed and divisive issues that arouse emotion will not undermine the structure of the academy
we need to continue to encourage the exchange of ideas and champion the causes of academic freedom and faculty rights as well as to challenge str uc tur es in place at the university
however this can be done in the context of civility and tolerance
in this way dialogue becomes productive and the faculty ombudsperson serves as the referee for the university so that all arguments are not suppressed and the tenets of the university are preserved

om buds may see rise in issues involving research relationships om buds from research institutions or universities may see rise in visitors with collaboration problems as the incidence of co authored publications in academe has risen steadily over the years
this upsurge is due to the increased costs of research advancing academic specialization increasing competition for research funding howard laird and more complex research questions all which require collaborative relationships lea he
predictions are that collaborations will continue to increase cor ley floyd sch roed er finn ol iv ola manton english
as fields become more interdisciplinary statistical techniques become ore rigorous and the or culture of academia prevails successful collaborative relationships may be necessity for successful academic careers
thus visitors to om buds offices may be more often engaged in intra research team conflict
much can be gained from collaboration
first collaborative relationships provide complementary skills and knowledge so research can be fully conceived and executed
second they provide an idea development mechanism wherein researchers exchange and modify each thoughts thereby improving and enhancing their studies
third they create groups with similar expertise so that of work can be done in safe and trusted setting cor ley
fourth they ro vide needed interpersonal relationships for what otherwise can be lonely profession frost taylor
finally collaborative research relationships allow science to progress in new interdisciplinary directions in order to address systemic and co mp lex issues ben nett gad lin marchand
however not all collaborative relationships regardless of size complexity project or longevity will be successful and garner all these benefits
unfortunately the price of collaboration can be high wray
researchers from diverse specialties and cultures amplify communication challenges and role conflict between allegiance to an external research team and the home institution may arise
multicultural research teams introduce her levels of complexities such as differing understandings of appropriate interpretation and reporting of data easter by smith ma lina
good collaboration requires at which not all researchers are skilled
as team size and increases so do costs
further problems can be free riding or improper inaccurate or even dishonest credit allocation le ahey lui et al
finally power relationships are frequently unequal in research tea ms as graduate students work with advisors and junior researchers work with those more senior and better connected to others with access to professional growth
given the potentially high costs of collaborations how can om buds assist such relationships to move forward successfully
what makes research collaboration effective in publishing high quality research generating multiple studies or prospering into decades of productive work
what enables them to be personally rewarding and enriching
what ma them fail at any or all of these goals
this article encourages om buds to help researchers improve the quality of the relationship by suggesting it move to covenantal rather than contractual model
we make this point by first exploring sacred co and legal contracts
we then discuss characteristics and likely outcomes of research collaborations that are covenantal
we conclude with om buds may use for assisting researchers to build maintain and enhance covenantal relations hips
journal of the international ombudsman association day et
the nature of covenants and contracts while the term is used legally it is also defined as usually formal solemn and binding webster
it is often associated with less prescribed relationships involving agreements between people or companies or even vocabulary com
relationships can be to the extent they represent shared goal vision or commitment that transcends the interests of the in divi duals involved
thus covenants deal more with shared values goals or vision while contractual arrangements specify actions to be undertaken desirable behaviors or other explicit agreements
we believe that research collaborations can be covenantal in this sense of the word
this type of covenant may be best illustrated in sacred covenants
sacred coven ants it is generally believed that the first human agreements were covenantal ela zar everett
sacred and other types of covenants di ff er from legal contracts along several dimensions
first covenants are expected to be permanent or nearly so and are changed or renegotiated when new occurrences or information require it miller while contracts are intended for fixed period nock and are unchangeable without their dissolution
second the holding the covenant together is strong emotional bond and deep empathy nock ela zar everett miller while contracts are impers on al legal agreements
third the originator in sacred contexts the divine serves as judge and final arbiter of any perceived violations while third party determines contract breaches and their resolution moves to the private domain mi ller
in secularly derived covenantal relationships broader sense of societally shared values may underlie the covenant such as those found in professions eg responsibility to no and members are seen as possessing in he rent dignity and rights of self determination miller
in contrast contracts are undertaken to enhance self interest and uphold the individual rights of their parties
fourth covenants require mutual respect trust integrity and responsibility while in contracts such values are less relevant due to protections afforded by legal enforceability ela zar
fifth membership on the human side of covenants is fluid and changeable parties may enter into the covenant or leave it and the cove nant continues to exist
contracts usually dissolve or are rewritten when one party leaves the frame everett
sixth sacred covenants entail broad and general expectation of reciprocity certain behaviors are to be undertaken without any immediate expectation of return and they are often intended to alter or enhance the character and integrity of its members
contracts however require defined exchanges at specific times and are not intended to affect its foundational mora li miller
finally sacred covenant unfolds and adapts gradually to needs and circumstances while contract is quickly defined and rigid and may therefore be challenged by unanticipated conditions or consequences
sacred covenantal rel at io ns hip assumes concern for the common good ethical distribution of property and protects those lower in status and power ma gill peace
in many ways the covenant defines the social identity of the human group as well as the nature of the divine and serves as means to establish stability and interdependence within the group journal of the international ombudsman association day et
as social identity covenant holds special significance to all parties and exists as valued and meaningful entity outside of its individuals
thus its members will find behavior congruent with the precepts as intrinsically attractive and will exercise free will self reflection and self evaluation to self regulate and maintain the covenant
while the back grounds are jud eo christian and thus the perspectives in this article are grounded in this cultural base covenants are found in most of the major religions
for example islam also accepts the abrahamic covenant as does judaism and christianity
further islam accepts other covenants such as that found in qu ran in which allah covenant from the people through the al islam
while buddhism does not generally profess covenants with god some congregations define them se lv es through covenantal relationships such as the sangha covenant of the buddhist temple of toledo buddhist temple of toledo nd
thus although our experience is limited we believe the concept of covenant is applicable to all human relationships and should therefore be familiar enough to most people to apply to the research setting
contracts contract is understood to be an oral or written promise that is enforceable by law
it is legally derived voluntary agreement between two or more parti es who intend to enter into enforceable obligations with one another brick ley
those obligations typically are promises to act to provide some work or service for specific valuable consideration or benefit
legal contract must also incorporate certain elements de long an offer and an acceptance of that offer an intention to create legal relations between the parties the agreement must be made in return for valuable consideration such as payment all parties must have the legal capacity to enter into the contract the object or subject matter of the contract must be legal law dictionary
contractual arrangements may take variety of forms and structures
for example in many us states simple agreement following mediated settlement when witnessed and signed constitutes contractual enforceable legal obligation
in practice these agreements typically are rewritten into legal language and structure by an attorney but this only hang es its form not the substance of the agreement into which the parties have entered ch es ler laurence nd
partnership structure is type of contractual relationship that assumes equality in ownership operational responsibility and as sum pt ion of liabilities for general partners limited partners serve as investors only
this contractual relationship implies that all general partners are responsible for the inputs processes and outcomes of the projects undertaken entrepreneur
often in small group of coauthors partnership might be the model most frequently adopted
as in all contracts such relationship requires clear specification of responsibilities roles effort and contributions
to be clear legally derived coven ants exist as well
they are type of contract or an element of contract and thus fall within the domain of contract law
within these bounds covenant is defined as an agreement or written promise between two or more parties that constitutes pledge to do something an affirmative covenant or refrain from doing something negative covenant hayes
for example legal covenants included in contractual arrangements between homeowners and associations often require them to mow their lawns weekly affirmative covenant or restrict homeowners from painting their houses certain colors neg ati covenant free dictionary nd
in law the concept of covenant is perhaps most frequently heard and used with respect to real property real covenants which are conditions attached to property deed
journal of the international ombudsman association day et
in summary covenants are permanent but change able deeply felt relationships based on higher values they demand mutual respect and trust and broadly and widely based reciprocity
contracts are much narrower agreements often legally derived temporary created for each self interest and val neutral
we suggest that the appropriate model for successful research collaborations is more closely aligned with those designed around sacred covenants rather than contracts for several reasons
research coll ab orations typically must adapt to changes in theories data newly published research and even new statistical procedures so flexibility in the relationship is necessity
second far from being logical rational interactions many research collab or ati ons involve different perspectives and opinions about the research or methodological approaches as well as academic egos that can be large and sensitive
these emotionally laden characteristics require research relationships to be nimble open honest re flect ive and self evaluative
third research collaboration must rely on the integrity of its members to analyze data honestly and report results that validly describe outcomes whether or not they support the hypotheses
thus we believe covenants as mp loy ed in sacred contexts are more appropriately applied to research collaborations than legalistic contractual approaches
indeed the idea that covenants should inform and shape work relationships is not new
the historic guild form was created from what were essentially covenantal agreements between members of the profession and the community guilds formed binding life long obligations to act ethically and honestly within community expectations involving deeply felt commitments with secondary co for self interest and personal gain everett
conv en antal research collaborations what does covenantal research collaboration look like
we apply sacred practices related to purpose time frame enforcement member expectations and member treatment
defining purpose covenantal research relationships focus on the bigger picture
inherent in sacred covenants is concern for the common good peace in research collaborations the common good can be conceived as the research group the entirety of the scholarly community the advancement of science or the bet te of the world
the glue holding covenantal research relationship together is based on social goods such as ethical behavior creating better science or generating practical solutions to critical problems
covenantal research relationships focus on the truth
in concern for the common good the collaboration concentrates on producing useful valid knowledge thus minimizing the motivation to falsify data or self plagiarize previous work
covenantal research collaboration concerns itself with the elf are of targets of the research ensuring that they will ultimately benefit from the generation of knowledge
time frame in covenantal research collaborations the duration of the relationship is not dependent upon single project but rather upon om mit ment to the purpose expectations and emotional commitment of the team
thus unlike contractual research undertakings the point is not only to finish successful project but to continue contributing to the shared purpose and mutual nurturance of collaborators
journal of the international ombudsman association day et
enforcement and member expectations research covenants self enforce collaboratively
even if senior colleague founded or leads the team enforcement is mutual and direction in how the project should proceed is expected from all parties
because emotional bonds are strong and motivations sincerely focused not only on the product but also the process of the research members are willing to devote more effort than others at times because the others are trusted to contribute when needed al are willing to more than they at some point in the collaboration
members are expected to self monitor and evaluate their own contributions in covenantal network of trust and flexibility and thus enforcement of quality quantity and effort norms are done mutually within the group
how members are treated research covenants are collegial and senior members serve as mentors
floyd sch roed er and work in developing model to establish author order in research collaborations provides framework to illustrate how covenantal and contractual rel at ion ships might work
these researchers juxtaposed motivation for collaboration and power balance as key elements predicting conflict over authorship credit see table resulting in four types of relationships collegial mentor ing meritorious and ire ct ing and specified the common approaches to author credit associated with each
table floyd sch roed er finn collaborative relationships model equal unequal types of motivation for collaboration collegial relationship in which no one person seeks to dominate
not caring about order of authorship
friendship taking turns carrying the load true collegiality
mentor ing with mentors who appreciated my abilities and efforts and give cre di where due
in mentor ing situation willingness of the doctoral student to grow learn and work hard
meritorious first author is the person who has contributed the most to the paper
authorship should be decided on who made most contribution
the rule most contribution first author
directing first author has primary responsibility
there has always been one lead author
when someone takes the lead and others feel ok
journal of the international ombudsman association day et
we propose that covenantal research collaborations are more aptly described by the two quadrants emphasizing social motivation for research collegial and mentor ing
members in covenantal relationships are less likely to be motivated by merit and direction as depicted in the two productivity quadrants the bottom row since their focus is on the common good longer term horizon and shared responsibility rather than individual achievement
floyd and his colleagues found that feelings of exploitation were common in the research rel at ion ships he studied we suspect these collaborations tended towards contractual rather than covenantal
in covenantal research collaboration ownership of scholarly theories precepts research activities and writing is seen as the property of the gro up of involved scholars rather than that of any individual contributor ma gill wray
covenants often assign property rights based on their higher values these values stipulate who is responsible for what in order to fulfill the covenant mag ill
for example when the hebrew people were told to occupy canaan because god wanted it to be theirs exodus the community owned the land not individuals
contractual approach to research on the other hand is likely to focus on productivity aimed at instrumental gain for individual scholars and in extreme cases perhaps without concern for the long term benefits of the research outcomes or the good of the larger community
contractual construed research relationship is less likely to create scholarly social identity provide sense of meaning concern for the common good or encourage development of an ethos of egalitarianism and equality
enforcement in contractual relationship will be based on carefully prec on ce iv ed determination of in as described in floyd et al
covenant gone wrong lessons from and tv er sky in michael nonfiction book the undoing project readers are introduced to the marvelously collaborative relationship enjoyed by daniel and amos tv er sky for many years and from which came frame breaking research

meet for lunch and long afternoon together and still have time to do our separate
the covenantal relationship in decline physical distance often leads to emotion al and intellectual diffidence which in turn leads to questions of intent and challenges of interpretation
after years of productive collaboration the began to disappear when they were physically separated for the first time ver sky at stanford and at the university of british columbia
they were separated by distance and began working with students and other co authors their relationship lost its sun stein thaler para
perceptions of outs id ers further eroded the relationship
consider the bitterness expressed in their joint conversation with harvard psychologist miles shore amos in the room danny complained
am perceived as attending him which is not the case
clear ly lose by the collaboration
credit business is very said amos
there is constant poking and people decide that one person gets the short end of the lewis page
these challenges of status difference perceptions professional envy and the powerful influence of inaccurate perceptions of their relative contributions began to divide them
as later said spoils of academic success such as th ey are eventually one person gets all of it or gets lot of it
status differences are often imposed by the outside world but over time may become internalized in ways that damage relationships
as time went on began to omit mentioning amos in presentations and look for other collaborators to take place even indicating to one that he and tv er sky were no longer working together though in fact they were
each den the other credit they had previously given willingly
with these challenges becoming more prominent and disturbing the scholarly relationship that was once described as as sun stein thaler para
am wife barbara who had the office next door at stanford said would hear their phone calls
it was worse than lewis page
building and sustaining covenantal collaborations it may be unreasonable to assume that all research teams can or should be covenantal
as some marriages may not be in some research collaborations sensibly base themselves solely on individually instrumental motivations with the goal only single publication or project and little interest on the part of members to remain together
for these types of collaborations researchers at the national institutes of health published what many consider the of practical research team effectiveness collaboration and team science fi eld guide ben nett gad lin marchand illustrating generally contractual or partnership based as opposed to covenantal approach to research
for example these recommendations touch on understanding roles responsibilities and expectations establishing processes for sharing data and checking references of new team members
we concur that these points are useful in establishing successful research relationships and that contractual research collaboration can be fruitful particularly in sho rt term projects
further many collaborations will have elements of both contract and covenant and this may be appropriate given that some team members may be useful only for particular project for which their specific skills are needed such as spec ia liz ed statistical analysis
journal of the international ombudsman association day et
however we also assert that the most productive research teams as were and tv er sky form long term bonds and level of trust that goes beyond the shorter term perspective of contractual relationships and partnerships
further sarge nt and water found effective research teams attributed their success to subjective criteria such as enjoying the experience getting to know collaborators better and learning through collaboration in addition to objective criteria like publication
success collaborators liked were attracted to and trusted each other all elements in floyd et al
social dimension and indicative of covenantal relationship
for teams that share common vision and focus creating covenantal relationship may ead to long term productivity and superior science
such covenantal research collaborations are long term relationship centered purpose driven flexible and operate according to accepted team norms
david hicks on describes covenantal ex peri en ce at as ton university in the first norms were clearly specified as mutual rather than competitive all team member names were listed as authors of all publications
further the team agreed to house their offices in one common space with adjoining desks rather than in separate rooms
the flexibility of this team was evident when two of the team members began to collaborate independently on an edited book unaware of the economic gain from publishing book as opposed to journal articles
due to the strength of their bond the team was able to withstand this stressor and continue working together productively hicks on
what is the role of om buds in helping researchers create covenantal rather than contractual collaborations
we answer this first by offering model figure for how covenantal relationships could be initially cultivated
we then provide recommendations for assisting visitors to move from or adapt confrontational research team likely based on contractual model to one more covenantal
journal of the international ombudsman association day et
framework for creating intentional covenantal research relationships preparation and prevention members and member expectations researchers beginning covenantal collaboration should try to identify others with whom they have meaningful shared history
such persons should be scrupulously ethical with strong vision of how the discipline or research questions need to develop to serve common good
member expectations should be discussed at length in relaxed nonthreatening and affirming contexts including frank discussions of both social and instrumental motivations along with the expected balance of power within and among team members sher wood glide well
the ongoing process of how the research is being accomplished should be discussed regularly with expectations that collaborators are willing to self reflect and modify their behavior and approaches when appropriate
time for socializing and creating friendship bonds should be included as well as the expectation that conflicts will be managed pro actively and respectfully
creating shared purpose research team members should have commitment to common purpose larger than one individual or research project
identifying the ver all thrust of research stream considering why it is important to the science organizations workers and perhaps even humanity as whole should frame the research and ensure the work represents meaningful intrinsically motivating and inspiring opportunity
connecting that sense of shared mission or purpose to the importance of nurturing the scholarly relationship and its output is equally important
focusing on ethical mandates for good science and admirable human behavior and aligning the part mission and activities is necessary to maintain quality in the work and personal integrity
preparation prevention identification of team members creating shared purpose mapping the future building meaning during the work understanding the time frame non work social activities nurturing mutual respect openness tran spa ency dissolution or recovery recovery requires humility commitment to the relationship responsiveness to sincere regret journal of the international ombudsman association day et
mapping future defining illustrating and building meaning into collaboration working together to create mutual understanding of covenantal fu tur will enable the partners to identify and prevent or prepare for possible pinch or crunch points likely events or actions that could threaten the covenantal relationship but that can be avoided or ameliorated with forethought sher wood glide well
consider the likely occurrence that collaborators must work distantly from each other as would occur during sabbatical or visiting professorship
being aware of the threats such distance imposes and preparing to overcome them may allow the coven an tal relationship to continue despite physical separation
though rarely as satisfying as working in close proximity world of virtual real time visual communication sky pe go ogle hangouts etc
eases the dilemma of physical distance
sim ila rly challenges imposed by distance or other threats to continued viability of covenantal research relationship can be set aside when there is powerful mutually understood and meaningful purpose to which the collaborators are committed
discussing re ating understanding and committing to shared purpose early in the relationship will help the team traverse rocky times and avoid the temptation to go their separate ways
during the work for successful research collaboration as in any high performing team factors such as shared purpose kat zen bach smith consistent and effective communication ben nett gad lin marchand mutual trust and respect among partners ach smith shared ownership of outcomes and meaningful work performed by each partner are critical to ongoing viability and success
likewise managing both the workload and relationship so no partner feels unequal is essential to sustainable oven antal research relationship as it is in any successful work team kat zen bach smith
understand the time frame it is unreasonable to hope that any research collaboration will be eternal
all research teams will have to grapple with the ques ti on of much at some point
however working toward common purpose will encourage the covenantal research longevity
having commitment to an entire stream of research centered on larger important and compelling question suggests hat the researchers are it for the long
like any good covenant members may have to step out and perhaps back into the team but the team should strive to maintain its identity over these flexes through creating culture that is agile enough change in useful ways when appropriate
what is reasonable time frame for team survival
this question must be answered by the research team as it develops and produces its work but commitment to and operating in sync with the common purpose will encourage optimal longevity
understanding clearly the mutual purpose will help partners to know when it is time to dissolve their team
dissolution of covenant is not necessarily failure many christians would argue that christ introduced but few of these same christians would claim the original abrahamic covenant was not of great value
journal of the international ombudsman association day et
non work activities many scholars have advocated for the essential bonding that develops as result of non work interactions
socializing to get her as did and tv er sky in their most productive years builds cohesiveness that goes beyond the bounds of normal working relationships
purposefully creating mutually enjoyable opportunities will improve the longevity and productivity of schola rly relationship and enhance its covenantal nature
non working lunches or side trips away from conference sites to hike canoe or shop can nourish relationships
even simply spending time chatting or sky ping about families friends and personal lives be fore beginning work can encourage sustainable bonds
mutual respect the importance of mutual respect in covenantal research relationship is difficult to overstate
trustworthiness integrity and appreciation expressed in casual conversation and illus tr ated through behavior are essential to climate of mutual respect
as an exemplar the end for and partnership began in those moments when each started to feel in the eyes of the other
small things can become big things thoughtless comment perceived as expressing contempt indicates failing relationship whether in research team or any relationship got tm an silver
openness and transparency researchers intent on covenantal relationship should immediate ly address concerns or challenges to the relationship
the most productive scholarly relationships are characterized by frequent transparent and forthright communication about work issues as they arise so they are dealt with before they become unman ag ea
willingness to speak up about things that seem right to test stories and assumptions about actions and the ability to clear the air through transparent communication are fundamental to covenantal relationships
of equal import anc covenantal researchers must be willing to be openly listen to complaints from partners
it must be safe for everyone in the covenantal relationship to initiate and participate in these conversations
dissolution or recovery humility john got tm an asserts that one of the most powerful predictors of failed marriage is contempt felt by one or both parties
such disregard and disrespect were also symptomatic of and failed relationship lewis
recovering relationship from threats of contempt requires above all sense of personal humility and commitment to the relationship over and above commitment to its hoped for outcomes got tm an silver
on one hand it is essential that partners in coven antal relationship be willing to express sincere regret and to act on that sincerity in ways that will repair the damage
it is equally essential that partners are willing to receive and respond to the expressed regret and restorative actions ex te nd ing acceptance of differences and even forgiveness when needed
these intentional acts require sacrifice of the ego in favor of personal humility
how om buds can assist visitors to shift from contractual to covenantal collaborations by understanding how covenantal collaboration forms om buds can assist visitors in dysfunctional teams to work together to determine if the team is salvageable or is facing its journal of the international ombudsman association day et
first suggesting team members begin conversation to ascertain each expectations may clarify if they are ready willing or interested in evolving into covenantal collaboration
what were their initial motivations to begin this project
whom do they see as its potential recipients
what difference in the world will the res ear ch results make
knowing these answers may make it clear to the visitor whether or not team members share any kind of overarching common purpose
if common purpose is definable can it be nurtured and grown to sound sustainable motivation for colla bo ration
second the om buds can help visitors explore how they feel about others on the team beyond the current conflict situation
do they enjoy spending time with them
is there trust and mutual respect
do they have anything in common besides this pr
are they the kind of colleague with whom they would like to enter into covenantal relationship
this informs whether the visitor wants to put the into deepening the relationship through dialogue about meaning how to address po ten ti al future conflicts or apportion work
these deep conversations are part of the fodder that expands and strengthens the common sense of purpose
third om buds can assist visitors in exploring their and their expectations of the time frame of the collaboration is it reasonably sustainable
are the levels of common purpose trust and mutual respect sufficient to maintain sustained covenantal re la ti on ship
would they enjoy spending personal time with these individuals
based on their initial exploration of the collaboration is there sufficient material to work to cultivate it into covenantal relationship
can the visitor commit to openness and ran spar ency with their colleagues in this team
answers to these questions will help visitors clarify their desires and expectations of the collaboration and help enable them to make decisions about their commitment to it
fourth om buds can help visitors identify and establish values basis for the covenant mutual purpose th at brings higher meaning to the work on which they collaborate
as noted earlier the unifying force holding covenantal research relationship together is grounded in concern for the common good
covenantal research collaboration concerns itself with the welfare of the targets of the research ensuring that they will ultimately benefit from the generation of knowledge
that united commitment to common purpose larger than on individual or research project can help frame the research and align the mission and research activities
fifth om buds can provide tools and guidance to help visitors prepare if they choose to have the conversations that can deepen re lati on ships resolve conflicts restore bonds and provide map for moving the collaboration into covenantal relationship
the informal independent and neutral pillars of the om buds practice provide fertile ground for helping visitors clarify their ex pe ct at ions strengthen their commitments and practice the skills needed to convert their contractual collaborations into budding covenantal ones
conclusion establishing maintaining and preserving covenantal research relationship is essentially about cultivating and nurturing the relationship
for such collaboration to endure members must be as intentional about relationship management as they are about work flow management
research relationships with their immense potential to be both productive an inspiring have too often been left to chance to accidental convergences of talent time and effort
when that convenient convergence is no longer effective as inevitably happens when left to chance the relationship flounders
however the potential for success in such relationships in the years of ground breaking productivity they enjoyed before the demise shows the powerful lessons to be gained from enduring committed endeavors sharing common purpose mutual respect and enduring trust journal of the international ombudsman association day et

organizational om buds in higher education often listen to people voice angst concern and pain when they experience disrespect abrasive conduct and other uncivil behavior such as the examples given above
visitors often experience bullying discrimination micro and macro aggressions privilege implicit bias and even violence
experts on abrasive conduct such as ley mann and adams found that abrasive conduct was extremely costly and its im pa ct could be felt by victims and organizations for years nam ie nam ie
when listening to visitor recount an experience that sounds like incivility one may ask if incivility in higher education is on the rise
the current political climate would indicate so
research in this area also indicates that it is clark po ra th twale de lu ca za ki
if this is true what are the roles and responsibilities of an om buds handling cases involving abrasive conduct
what does an om buds experience
these questions prompted the investigation of incivility in higher education and the role
this curiosity about this topic became the basis for the doctoral dissertation and for this article
this research sought to answer two questions
what does an om buds experience when handling cases of ab ras ive conduct in the higher education environment
how do om buds handle these types of cases
four consistent themes arose from the interviews with om buds who work in higher education those themes are
the story drives the ex peri enc
how om buds define and identify abrasive conduct
the powerful impact of the academic structure
guiding dynamics the role of the om buds the purpose of this article is to discuss the first theme
the second third and fourth themes will be shared in fut ure article
in this manuscript please note that the terms incivility and abrasive conduct are used interchangeably
participants the participants are om buds who have practiced in higher education institutions hei in ca for mini mu of years
the international ombudsman association research committee was approached for permission to request ts through their organization
they agreed and sent an email to all members interested in ting in this re sea rc project
from that pool of participants purposeful sampling was used to select om buds with minimum of experience in higher education
for clarity it is important to note that the people quote going forward are the uni om buds who were interviewed
hey are also referred to as per mou sta kas description of participants
to maintain confidentiality pseudonyms were used when quoting them and back grounds were excluded in this article
major findings the story drives the experience journal of the international ombudsman association escalan te the experiences om buds had when handling cases of abrasive conduct were consistently impacted and guided by the context of the visitor experience
what the om buds experience on day today basis is strongly influenced by stories and perceptions regarding what happened to them
it is the story that determines how the om buds identifies and even defines abrasive conduct
the extraordinary talents and skills that om buds employ are driven by the goals and desired outcomes
it is al about the visitor
how an om buds experiences cases of incivility is also influenced by the complicated structure of academia
there is tenure to consider the complex layers of hierarchy and the power dynamics at play in any workplace relationship
the heer complexity of the academic workplace environments can promote and tolerate bad behavior by its employees
this is not to say that corporate environments are not complicated
however most organizations do not have to navigate the complicated dynamics created by tenure and shared governance
om buds are also guided by strong influences such as the international ombudsman association standards of practice sop the values and policies of their institution and strong desire to advocate for fair ne ss and equity
regardless of the and the experience this research indicates that the phenomenon of incivility is occurring in higher education kea sh ly neum an
three of the om buds interviewed have experienced an increase cases of incivility since the presidential election
others believe that incivility and lack of respect and dignity for others has always existed and is now much more tolerated and even rewarded
the reality of our current state is that some are treated badly in higher education
faculty staff and students experience abrasive conduct in academia and the om buds is in unique position to help guide people through these negative and painful experiences
as one om buds stated just want to help them get through this place in one
to illustrate how the experience drives the experience we begin with story and how camelia nash the university om buds handled case
camelia is an om buds in an inst it ut ion of higher learning with extensive experience handling cases of bullying and abrasive conduct
mi ray came to office feeling suicidal frustrated and abused by her doctoral advisor
mi ray described complex and disturbing situation that in vo lv ed multiple levels of incivility and abuse
for mi ray it began by being neglected by her advisor
she felt lost and unsure of her direction and progress
the advisor ignored her and return her em ails
the abrasive conduct escalated to level of that most would consider to be completely inappropriate
the advisor was often absent but when he was there he yelled and belittled the doctoral student
this student experienced multiple levels of bullying including threatening to be fired and belittled by other students in the program
she appeared to be of eastern descent and her classmates would say inappropriate things such as you ride camels
because mi ray was having difficulty connecting with other students her advisor eventually sent an email to the chair and to the department stating that this student was dangerous and be allowed on campus
as camelia stated was nothing unusual about her
she just looked middle eastern to them
nothing about her behavior suggested something was wrong
he wrote this email to several people saying she be let in the building and yet all her classes were in the building
at that point she came to me
to make matters worse mi ray was also escorted off campus by security
mi ray was humiliated heartbroken alone and was about to lose her job if camelia could not help her
the academic career could soon end in disaster and most important ly she was considering suicide
camelia expertly handled this case of incivility and was ultimately able to help this doctoral student
camelia first ensured that this person was safe by taking her to school counselor
camelia listened to story empathized with her situation and worked to help mi ray to find solutions without compromising confidentiality impartiality independence and informality
with journal of the international ombudsman association escalan te permission camelia then worked with the dean of the graduate school and discovered that the advisor could not simply fire the doctoral student
this particular advisor was known as notorious bully
he thought of doctoral students as
camelia was able to work with the dean and get mi ray into different program with different advisor
to best help mi ray camelia engaged in multiple om buds roles and methods to help her
she experienced story and focused on what mi ray wanted to happen to solve her difficult situation
camelia practiced the sop and found in novative ways to help her visitor
she worked within the structure and hierarchical dynamics of the institution and found way to help mi ray
camelia was coach an empathetic listening ear and confidential resource to mi ray
om buds have an ability to separate what they think should happen from what the visitor wants to happen
this is not to say that om buds do not experience the phenomenon of abrasive conduct through their individual perceptions and interpretations of the world
because om buds are people they are affected emotionally and cognitively however om buds rely heavily on the story to handle these types of cases in non judgmental and impartial manner
based on the interviews with om buds this research found that these ex per are consistent among practitioners
bob stated starting point for me in an example of incivility is to ask the visitor what happened
what behaviors were exhibited to make you feel you were disrespect ed
comment captures this finding that the om buds relies on the story and the goals to determine how to best handle their cases
violet emmers on best captured this theme when she stated the following in terms of how we are guided we are deeply rooted in the clients and goals and in trying to help them think forward and not backwards
there are times when things need to be resolved from the past and we try to develop options for that
certainly where somebody feels they have been wronged in the past
lot of our work is helping people move and think forward that is because so many of the people we see in our office feel
the international ombudsman association standards of practice greatly influence what the om buds experiences when handling cases of abrasive conduct
all of the om buds interviewed were well indoctrinated in the sop and followed them in various degrees
impartiality or neutrality is an especially powerful inf lu en ce on what om buds experience
even the most social justice minded om buds work diligently to be impartial
being an impartial resource provides reliable framework that promotes opportunities for om buds to be empathetic with their visitors
when kevin was asked if he follows the sop he responded but push the limits
he went on to describe visitor who sought out his services
this person was bit according to kevin
his visitor sa id hope not offending
response was true example of impartiality and empathy
although kevin suspected this person was racist this suspicion did not impede ability to listen to this story and act as confidential and impartial resource for this employee
commitment to impartiality provided space for him to empathize with his visitor
while striving to be impartial and confidential om buds also exhibit the ability to be authentic with their visitors
bill expressed this sentiment when he said other piece for me is that make sure that am authentically who am because think people see when you are not who you are and they dont like it
om buds are very self aware and apply this self awareness to help their visitors feel that they truly are being listened too
the om buds strives to understand the tory
visitors often have not been listened to or have not had safe environment to journal of the international ombudsman association escalan te candidly express what is bothering them
the om buds is at times the first person with which the university employee has been completely candid
empathy and understand in human nature om buds are able to let the story drive their experience because they are ext re me ly intuitive and empathetic listeners
they are skilled at ident if yi ng options for their visitors
the om buds interviewed are compassionate and in nov at ive leaders within their organizations and many of them are driven by pa ssi on for fairness and equity
an important skill om buds develop is the ability to balance empathy with maintaining impartiality and an understanding of human nature
maria ma so maria described an endowed chair who was allegedly post doc students
she explained person was an international student and their advisor was part of the evil that made it an art to consolidate power wield control and dictate
this was an endow ed chair and world renowned guy
maria referred to research on bullying and abrasive conduct and she explained you do some reading in literature there are pe op le who are just made this way
they are acting out of feel in inadequacy and incompetence
many of them have imposter syndrome and fear people are going to find that they arent really that smart and they really dont know that much and so they or theyve been in this situation and were the target
these pe op le decide that nobody is ever going to treat them this way again and take the aggressor role
conclusion that there is percentage of people who are not is included here because other om buds interviewed stated in different ways that they are often aware that the person sitting across from them may no be telling complete story
for example violet shared that often the people coming to her office to complain about being bul li ed are the bul lies themselves
yet the bullies truly believe their perceptions of what is happening
furthermore it is not uncommon for the om buds to have insight into this behavior from others who have complained about this very person it ting across from he om buds
understanding that om buds can be empathetic while also holding space for the possibility that other parties may be experiencing this situation in completely different way is an important point to make
om buds can be both empathetic and im parti al
kevin also expressed belief that there is population of people who are innately rude and abrasive
as kevin said are some people ho just hugged enough
they are professional social mis fi ts or professional sociopath frankly we have many people in universities that are high functioning you can add whatever after that
people with power an interesting aspect of the way om buds empathize with others is their awareness of the impact of powerful people on he people wh experience abrasive conduct
every om buds interviewed expressed that the people who are most often accused of abrasive co have some form of power
this power comes in the form of pos it ion status or social power
according to the finding of this research the abuse of power is most often the cause of abr as iv conduct in higher education
om buds are aware of this and this awareness influences how they help people
bob addressed this phenomenon when describing how he deals wi th people in authority who have been accused of incivility
he stated im bala do make things difficult
there is no policy that holds them accountable unless there is something internal that journal of the international ombudsman association escalan te holds them
bob also believes his role as om buds is to give voice to those with less power
in higher education students can be victims of incivility
regarding his role as om buds bob stated om buds role is ay for people to have voice
good example is students always feel hat they have voice and been heard because professors ca shut down conversation
faculty always want to be bothered by complaining and entitlement
faculty has lot of power when determining if student cheated or not
kevin br on so kevin described case involving primary investigator pi who was screaming and ling at his post doc students
to this pi the post doc exp erie was supposed to be brutal
it was what he experienced so he believed all post docs should experience it also
what the pi did not realize was that he was devastating students nd destroying his own program
students were leaving the program because of his behavior
teri also expressed that some people with power feel untouchable in some way
she stated makes them look to people as being untouchable or they hav lot of power of some kind
it could be staff member who has brought in million dollars and would cut the money flow
conc lu sion in short what the om buds experiences is intimately connected to the story and the experience
the om buds feels sees and hears what the visitor experiences through the story
om buds do this by setting aside their per sp and as sum ing the perspective
om buds give the visitor the benefit of the doubt that their story is true and accurate
om buds intuitively practice what the german philosopher edmund called epoch
for epoch consists in my gaining the ultimate standpoint whereby become the detached beholder of my natural worldly ego and its life
om buds deliberately decide to suspend their personal belief and opinions to help people
skilled om buds do not detach from their personal beliefs but are able to separate what they believe fr om what the visitor believes
the om buds is what some of the ie wees called
om buds rely on their own senses to experience what the is it or does while holding on to the pos of other perspectives
from this vantage point om buds experience the painful and difficult cases involving abrasive conduct in an empathetic and impartial mind set
the om buds interviewed are highly emotionally intelligent and they understand human nature and the powerful need most people have to be ated with dignity and respect
these om buds also had developed empathetic skills
according to za ki professor of ch ology at stanford university and the director of the stanford social neuroscience lab empathy is skill that can be developed with practice over time
humans are not hard wired to be empathetic
this seems counterintuitive to what bee told in the past about empathy
in his book the war for kindness za ki writes from many labs including my own suggests that empathy is less like fixed trait and more like skill something we can sharpen over time and adapt to th modern wo
empathy is like muscle that can grow stronger with use
this insight into empathy aligns with the findings of this research regarding how om buds handle cases and how they interact with their visitors
being an om buds is like going to the empathy gym and working out every day
over time om buds become adept at exercising empathy with their visitors
consequently it is not surprising that story is the story was the overarching theme that surfaced during this re se arch
perhaps another way of stating this finding is that om buds practice highly developed and sophisticated level of empathy
the om buds interviewed consistently experienced this phenomenon
journal of the international ombudsman association escalan te this research project initially asked do om buds in her education experience when handling cases of abrasive conduct and how do om buds handle these cases
this research discovered that om buds empathetically experience the story and that phenomenon drives what om buds do
much was learned from th om buds who were interview ed and the author is grateful that they were willing to share their experiences

management workplace ethics organizational culture ethics journal of the international ombudsman association wen dt like it or not many of us spend the majority of our days at work
in the best case scenario the time we spend at our job is enriching and fulfilling allowing us to exercise skills and build our capacity to do and be more
in the worst case scenario non of this is true
with virtue at work ethics for individuals managers and organizations geoff moore wants to help more of us find our way to the best case scenario and he makes strong case that bringing ethics into the workplace is the way to do so
the ethics moore deals with are more precisely virtue ethics
like other branches of ethics virtue ethics tries to identify how to live good life
however the virtue ethics approach is distinct from other branches of ethics in that it centers on and the stories they tell about their lives
in other words virtue ethics holds that how people talk about their lives how they place events along their narrative quest can have profound impacts on whether or not they become fully realized individua ls
as book about ethics this is not particularly tactical read
it will not advise ombudsmen on how to conduct the business of being of an ombudsperson
however it will be of use for an ombudsperson with an interest in analyzing how to create ex peri enc es and structures within workplace that help people act virtuously
the foundation of virtue at work comes from the thinking of scottish moral philosopher alas da ir mac in tyre and more specifically book after virtue study in moral thin king
with virtue at work moore applies philosophy to the questions that arise for working people about their jobs putting into practice belief that philosophy needs to respond to everyday questions of everyday people
the book structured into three parts
part introduces the concepts which will be used throughout the rest of the book
this includes the definition of what an organization is in chapter an explanation of virtue ethics in chapter and an overview of the mac in tyre an approach to virtue ethics in chapter
chapter is particularly important to understanding the rest of the book since it introduces the concepts of internal goods excellence in practice pursuit of virtue and character and external goods weal th fame reputation the potential risks if the pursuit of external goods is prioritized over the pursuit of internal goods and the concepts of practices and the common good
part ii is significant section which takes the mac in tyre an framework of vi rt ethics and applies it to the individual manager and organization
chapter outlines characteristic of virtuous individuals and discusses the importance of integrity as virtue in an life
here moore spends time on explaining meaningful work and explores how work can be objectively or subjectively meaningful
chapter focuses on managers and management
moore acknowledges largely negative view of managers as neutral before trying to repurpose their image
moore also identifies the characteristics of virtuous manager
most notable on this list are resistance and concern about the mode of institutionalization of the organization
chapter introduces list of eight characteristics of virtuous organization it also proposes eight ways for adding virtue or crowding in virtue as moore puts it to an organization
these include recruiting larger proportion of staff who are naturally pro social meaning they play for the common good creating inclusive gov er nance encouraging group identity potentially by limiting executive pay and adding transparency
because of its potential impact and practicality this section was one of the most useful parts of the book
with part iii the book concludes by looking at examples of how this framework has been used by different kinds of organizations
businesses including banks and pharmaceuticals are the focus of chapter
non business such as symphonies circuses and churches are the focus of chapter
in this section moore highlights the recurring tension that exists in organizations about balancing the pursuit of excellence in practices internal goods with the need for money and resources external goods
he also makes some notes about factors that can mi tig ate some of the noxious impacts of institutionalization of journal of the international ombudsman association wen dt practices
in particular he identifies professional associations environments or micro climates conducive to virtuous behavior and less harmful forms of organizational institutionalization as potential mitigating factors
even with all good about virtue at work one note of caution needs to be added
this is not really the right choice for casual office book club or anyone looking for light reading
despite the stated purpose of making philosophy to those we might call it seems unlikely casual readers would stick with it
for example plain is used to describe essentially non philosophical king people
later on on page geoff explains the implications of virtue ethics for organizations saying virtuous organization would understand that its primary function is to focus on the core practice to ensure excellence in the pursuit of the internal goods of that
moore is an excellent and clear writer but the language creates stuffiness in the text which risks alienating some readers
in addition the work stays heavily on the side of theory
there are times when natural ques ti ons of application which might come up for those plain interested in using the framework for their lives are set aside as outside the scope of this book
for example the rather juicy question of how we can decide collectively if job meaningful is stated and then set aside
while fair for moore to set limits on scope this choice keeps the concepts largely in theoretical space
still virtue at work is worthwhile read for those who are willing to dig in
it confronts rathe challenging question of how to use work as tool for self development even when parts of work exist in opposition to the qualities we may want to develop
it could be particularly impactful for organizational leaders and managers who have the ability influence organizational culture
sections which may be valuable to ombudsmen include the section of chapter outlining how to add virtue at an organizational level along with the illustration described in chapter of how self reflection on framework was used as tool to influence management
additionally the overall approach to developing an ethical framework for work practice maybe generally helpful to ombudsmen
overall with virtue at work moore creates well ordered book which care fully introduces and layers ideas to reach its final conclusion that mac in tyre an framework could act as powerful tool to help guide employees and organizational leaders to direct their work towards more responsible and ethical ends

journal of the international ombudsman association wen dt author bio eliza bet wen dt eliza bet wen dt is graduate of the university of washington and currently works on issues of charter school compliance at oakland unified school district
journal of the international ombudsman association adams ras ch introduction the organizational om buds profession is young but it continues to professionalize and its reputation and reach are developing
see eg john sen and aba resolution
as the om buds role is increasingly cited as tool to address sexual harassment press release june it becomes increasingly important to identify certain ethical challenges inherent to the work and to create and refine guidelines for practitioners
in this article the authors exam in the risks of sexual harassment and problematic consensual relationships for om buds visitors and the profession
several strategies for addressing these concerns are recommended
as advocates for fair processes and adherence to policy organizational om buds work is on the cutting edge of dynamic new normal for equitable and respectful relationships in our institutions
om buds have traditionally assisted visitors concerned about sexual harassment and problematic consensual relationships within their organizations but have they looked at their own actions in this regard
as neutral impartial and independent as they strive to be om buds are human and not immune to gender sexual and power dynamics
at this point to ignore these issues could result in harm to om buds professionals and the individuals and organizations they serve
om buds and sexual harassment om buds as harasser as me too and related cultural movements have dem on st rated sexual harassment is significant problem for many organizations institutions and professional associations
although people commonly think of assaults and quid pro quo sexual harassment as the primary problems recent na sem study has shown that other forms of sexual harassment such as unwanted sexual attention and gender harassment are actually much more prevalent
despite the current prominence and ubiquity of these issues organizational om buds have not yet formally examined the implications for their own profession
by their nature many om buds meetings are likely to involve visitors who feel mistreated vulnerable dis empowered or anxious
these confidential conversations take place behind closed doors often in location that is secluded or discrete by design
the om buds may be perceived as nurturing and supportive but also as having power relative to the concern and the institution
the potential for boundary violations or exploitation exists by the very nature of this relationship
it would be to assume that no om buds has ad or would ever have lapse of judgement or self discipline while serving in this role
behaviors that may not violate sexual harassment policies or law can still make visitor feel uncomfortable confused unsafe or violated
an om buds might make on scious or unconscious assumptions about abilities situation or aspirations based on gender which could affect the quality of the meeting
while most organizations have sexual harassment policies that prohibit commenting on appearance asking about marital status or asking someone out an om buds must be particularly cautious about engaging in conversations such as these
om buds understand that even good intentions can have negative effect
for example an rapport building comments may be perceived as flirtatious or as an infringement upon personal space and not central to the main concern
following up too strongly or frequently may generate discomfort or questions about the motives
an unexpect ed hug could set off alarms
differences in age gender identity sexual orientation culture and language can all lead to misunderstandings andor errors in judgement
om buds particularly new om buds need guidance about how to make skillful and informed decisions related to visitor relationships
visitors in turn need to know where to go to voice concerns about the om buds
journal of the international ombudsman association adams ras ch there have been numerous instances in which psychologists lawyers and medical doctors have been accused and found guilty of very serious sexual harassment or sexual assault
this could easily happen within the om buds profession as well
given the crucial role that trust plays in an role complaints of sexual harassment against an om buds have the potential to be particularly damaging to all individuals involved and to the profession
most establish ed professions that involve confidential meetings such as psychology law medicine and social work have already developed policies and proc ed ur es about sexual harassment within their membership
the judiciary has also been working to address harassment within its ranks
these professions have all established clear policies and guidelines regarding behavior that is not acceptable
currently the om buds profession is behind the curve and by neglecting to address these ssu es om buds are increasing the risk of psychological harm to visitors legal or professional damage to om buds and reputation al damage to the profession
om buds as target over of women and of men experience sexual harassment at work
rates of sexual harassment are about greater for and native american women
an om buds can be on the receiving end of sexual harassment in the workplace through actions taken either by visitors or colleagues
in addition to emotional trauma experiencing sexual harassment from visitor during session could also affect an neutrality in relation to the visitor their department the sexual harassment investigator and perhaps the administration overall
raising complaint about such an issue has the potential to negatively affect the reputation of the om buds and the office
statements about meeting may be quite different from the recollection or state me and determining the truth about what went on during confidential meeting may be very challenging if not impossible
an complaint could lead to questions about the ability to protect confidentiality or about the judgment and actions
sexual harassment concerns involving om buds who work in the same office have the potential to harm the careers of both parties
of female attorneys in the us have been sexually harassed by other attorneys at work according to study
ho ni gs berg et al
if professionals such lawyers who know the rules better than anyone are crossing these lines and subjecting their colleagues to sexual harassment then there is reason to believe that om buds could find themselves in the same position
again the cost of reporting such incidents within the institution could be too high for an om buds to take that risk
having channel to report to other om buds who would be knowledgeable of the context could be more viable option
the om buds profession is still small field where job opportunities are scarce and newcomers often depend on seasoned om buds to recommend them
this power differential creates conditions in which sexual harassment or exploitation may arise
new or aspiring om buds may feel reluctant to set clear boundaries or report sexual harassment out of fear of harming their professional futures
harassment at conferences recent survey by the american political science association has sh ed light on the fact that sexual harassment and assault are not uncommon experiences at professional conferences
events that involve overnight stays away from the work site especially where alcohol is involved increase the likelihood that some attendees will behave unethically or inappropriately
many professional associations have begun to establish policies and procedures for providing support and reporting channels during conferences and training events including the establishment of on site om buds se at conferences
the recent creation of conference and an ongoing om buds position is positive step in this direction
journal of the international ombudsman association adams ras ch the holds several trainings each year as well as major annual conference
policies procedures and resources for ep or ting and addressing sexual harassment at these events are not currently provided
other regional organizational om buds groups also hold on site meetings where overnight travel is required
the absence of clear reporting channels or guidance regarding unacceptable behavior may create unnecessary confusion and risk for adversely impacted attendees
one reading might be that there are no problematic conference behaviors to address or conversely current behavior is not seen as problematic
another reading might be that the targets of harassment are self sufficient and need the support of the organization or conversely the organization responsible for supporting targets
at the very least it seems important for om buds to explore these issues more fully as other professional associations have
sexual harassment and om buds confidentiality if incidents of sexual harassment occur during om buds sessions how do om buds protect themselves and visitors and also adhere to standards of practic
there are no current exceptions within the sops that would allow an om buds to waive confidentiality to discuss an alleged violation that occurred during visitor consultation
our profession has not provided means by which om buds can be free of the of confidentiality whether the om buds is complainant or defending themselves against an accusation
laws exist for psychotherapists regarding exceptions to confidentiality that include situations where client is using the confidential setting to commit crime or sue psychotherapist
the american bar model rules of professional conduct permit an attorney to disclose information relating to the representation of client to establish claim or defense or to respond to allegations
the om buds pr of es sion should consider creating exceptions to confidentiality where an om buds is on one side or another of sexual harassment case
the feeling is mutual consensual relationships many om buds see their profession as noble act of service
even if we assume that om buds nobility implies vow of celibacy within the sops regarding visitor relationships which some om buds may believe to be the case an om buds still may have to grapple with the complexities of being in consensual relationship with some one else within the organization
there are number of ethical questions to consider related to consensual relationships between om buds visitors to the om buds office or others within the organization
consensual relationships with visitors one can als imagine numerous scenarios in which consensual relationship with visitor could harm visitor psychologically and professionally as well as lead to violations of the sops related to neutrality and conflicts of interest
notably there is no state men in the ethics code standards of practice or best pr act ices documents that specifically prohibits sexual relationships with current or past visitors to an om buds office including with students
in this way the ethics code differs dramatically from the ethics codes of psychologists medical doctors coaches and mental health counselors which all clearly prohibit sexual relationships between those professionals and the people they serve
attorneys are also prohibited from engaging in consensual sexual relationships with clients unless the relationship began prior to representation
in addition to the potential harm to individual visitors the general trustworthiness credibility and reputation of the om buds are all at stake
lacking positional authority an om buds needs to command high level of trust and respect and to be perceived as viable resource
the om buds stands on complex shaky ground when it comes to romantic relationships at work
an om buds who is romantically involved with visitor may be perceived as taking advantage of their position for selfish reasons
such an involvement could also be deterrent visitors who wish to consult with the om buds about sexual harassment related concerns
if the relationship ends badly there will also be increased grievance andor legal exposure for the om buds and the institution related to claims of sexual harassment and reputation al damage for everyone concerned
journal of the international ombudsman association adams ras ch similar complications could also arise for an om buds who becomes romantically involved with past visitor
in order to minimize the potential negative effects of this type of relationship other professions have instituted rules such as mandatory following the end of provided services before such relationship could be considered to be ethically acceptable
the aba model standards of conduct for mediators states that subsequent to mediation mediator shall not establish another rel at io ns hip with any of the participants in any matter that would raise questions about the integrity of the mediation
when mediator develops personal or professional relationships with parties
the mediator should consider factors such as time elapsed following the mediation the nature of the relationships established and services offered when determining whether the relationships might create perceived or actual conflict of interest
consensual relationships with ot he rs within the organization it is not uncommon for individuals within an organization to become romantically involved and when this happens conflicts of interest and awkwardness are often part of the territory
but when one of those individuals is an uds these problems become significantly more complicated
some of the potential problems regarding consensual romantic or sexual relationships are fairly obvious while others are more subtle and require thoughtful consideration
consensual relationship between an om buds and constituent may occur in number of ways
om buds are often selected from within an organization and may already be married to or romantically involved with someone else affiliated with that organization
the om buds may have re ce nt ly separated or divorced from someone within the same organization
an om buds may fall in love or simply be interested in dating colleague at work
consensual relationship of this sort creates the potential for numerous conflicts of interest with er visitors who know work with or have conflicts with the person whom the om buds is involved with
conflict of interest concerns could also emerge if an om buds were to date close relative or ex partner of visitor
an om buds could unknowingly become involved with someone employed at the same workplace or with student
shorter serial romantic relationships are becoming more common with the use of dating ap ps and people often know the real name of the person on the other end let alone their profession or workplace when they go on date
this may pose less of problem for om buds who work in large metropolitan areas but om buds who date within smaller communities or isolated institutions may have little choice but to seek relationships with in their institutions
the code of ethics states ombudsman does not engage in any situation which could create conflict of
given that anyone become visitor does this mean that the om buds should not have romantic relationship with anyone in the organization
there is much to be thoughtful about when considering the ethical implications of these relationships
consider consensual relationships between an om buds and student over the age of
some academic institutions prohibit staff student relationships
others permit staff to become involved with students unless they serve in an evaluative capacity over that student
con se qu some academic om buds would technically be within their rights under their policy to date students but is this truly ethical behavior from the perspective of the om buds profession
such relationship could be fraught with risks for er yo ne involved and create reputation al damage to the office and the profession
does it make difference if the student is older than the traditional student age
as om buds we should discuss and clarify the appropriate professional expectations re gar di ng sexual involvements with students
om buds recusal the best practices document states that an om buds should recuse him or herself from working with client when made aware of conflict of interest but the mechanics of this process journal of the international ombudsman association adams ras ch are unclear
does the om buds have any guidelines that clarify which conflicts of interest are significant enough to warran recusal
whom can they consult with when there are shades of gray
what should an om buds say to visitor about being unable to work with them due to consensual relationship or other conflict of interest especially if the reason for the conflict of interest is confidential or personal
do visitors have the right to see another om buds when an om buds recuses him or herself
where would recused om buds refer visitor if the om buds is solo practitioner
answers to questions such as these would aid pr act it ion ers who encounter these situations
om buds could look to some of the practices which have guided other neutrals in this regard
the aba model standards of conduct for mediators for example requires that mediators disclose potential conflicts of interest as soon as possible
expanding the code of ethics standards of practice and best practices documents the purpose of an ethics code for profession is to establish guidelines for honest respectful ethical and safe behavior within that professional role
the current code of ethics describes the fundamental features that define org ani zat ion al om buds work but is quite short and too limited in scope to adequately establish the guidelines requisite for our complex profession
the standards of practice and best practices documents primarily reinforce and explicate the current code of et hi cs but number of important ethical concerns remain unaddressed
for example none of official documents address the risks of potential harm to visitors colleagues interns students members of the community or om buds staff as result of in te ra ct ions with the om buds
they also do not specifically acknowledge the ethical challenges that can arise in the om buds profession from sexual harassment and consensual relationships
om buds understand problems related to sexual harassment conflicts of in te rest and the lack of effective policies because people bring these issues to their offices every day
the training experience and skills that om buds have to assist people with these struggles are what make om buds such unique and valuable resource
it is time for om buds to integrate their refined understanding of inequity oppression and conflicts of interest with the foundations of their own profession
om buds should be role models around these issues and establish best practices within their own professional contexts
institutions normally have clear sexual harassment policies and om buds are accustomed to applying them in the context of concerns and options for visitors
should there also be best practices established for investigations pro cesses and sanctions regarding om buds misbehavior
as we have discussed the om buds serves unique role one of independence confidentiality and neutrality which may require unique processes for handling the complexities of sexual harassment complaint recommendations one path forward would be to make recommendation to the board to expand the ethics code standards of practice and best practices documents to address these issues more specifically
such recommendations could include de velo ping clear statement regarding sexual harassment behavior by om buds establishing committee and creating policies for handling sexual harassment complaints that involve om buds including definitions reporting channels investigative procedures due process confidentiality findings and application of sanctions if warranted
this could be modeled on existing policies used by other professional associations and the professional practices committee of co
sanctions could include but not be limit ed to suspension or loss of co status andor membership exclusion from conferences verbal or written censure and recommendations for coaching counseling or training making clear statement regarding sexual and romantic relationships with visitors developing best practices regarding the varieties and risks of consensual relationships between an om buds and others within the organization journal of the international ombudsman association adams ras ch clarifying the definition of of and creating best practices for recusing ones elf from an om buds case andor developing mechanisms to provide expanded communication resources and guidance to members about issues connected with sexual harassment and consensual relationships
conferences and trainings recommendations for dd re ssing the issues of sexual harassment and consensual relationships during conferences and trainings include establishing and publicizing behavioral expectations at conferences and trainings creating procedures for reporting sexual harass men and providing safety resources for sexual harassment sexual assault or other disturbing or criminal behavior by attendees and publicizing these widely enhancing foundations training in the areas of om buds ethics sexual harassment consensual relationships and conflicts of interest expanding the co exam to include additional questions about ethics including sexual harassment conflicts of interest and consensual relationships requiring candidates for co certification to take ethics training for om buds requiring certain number of professional development hours of sexual harassment and ethics training for co certification renewal andor developing an tr ai ning focused on ethics
this training would address ethical issues not currently addressed in the foundations course including topics related to sexual harassment conflicts of interest and consensual relationships
it could be designed to satisfy po ten ti al co renewal requirement for pd hs on ethics
research to help guide decisions about addressing these issues it would also be helpful to survey membership anonymously regarding sexual harassment and consensual relationships develop mech ani to solicit input from the membership on possible remedies and sanctions and seek input to develop policies that are applicable internationally
conclusion om buds are the very people from whom others seek guidance related to complex and chal leng in situations involving sexual harassment and consensual relationships yet the organizational om buds profession has not kept current with other similar professions in addressing these issues within their own ranks
this unnecessarily increases the risk of trauma law suits embarrassment bad publicity and damaged reputations
as the profession matures into its young adulthood it is time for organizational om buds to put their own house in order
imperative to articulate clear position on sexual ha ra ss ment and consensual relationships and to create or update related policies and practices

how to om buds journal of the international ombudsman association con ger jennifer how to be an inclusive leader your role in creating cultures of belonging where everyone can thrive is short book with big goal
grounded and accessible it is appropriate for anyone wanting or needing to move from good intentions to meaningful impact in service of truly inclusive organizations
brown an established dive and inclusion consultant and entrepreneur takes an approach that is both supportive and challenging enough to help readers of many kinds learn and change
she writes from perspective that is equal parts expert guide and humble co traveler making how to be an inclusive leader welcoming to all yet coddling to none
intended as guide the book presumes that most readers already believe diversity and inclusion have value
the introduction does however include few research backed remi nd ers on why inclusion matters that inclusive teams and organizations regularly outperform non inclusive ones
this book builds on first inclusion diversity the new workplace the will to change to help people put ideas into action
her fundamental framework for doing so is what brown calls inclusive leader an iterative developmental model that includes four stages unaware aware active advocate
the book walks through each stage in turn giving relevant guid an ce exercises and real world examples and concluding with series of next steps that point toward the subsequent stage
the advice in how to be an inclusive leader is straightforward but it is not simple
much of what brown offers pertains to refl ec ti on perspective shifting and developing good habits of mind
inclusion is not cookie cutter practice its core premise is that one size does not fit all
accordingly most of advice is about how to position oneself for the growth and challenges inherent in becoming an inclusive leader with reminders peppered throughout that the journey is long but worthwhile
brown nicely scaffolds the core ideas of her book using glossary graphics and call outs to explain concepts clearly and usefully
the inclusive leader continuum is an efficient if basic framework that will feel familiar to anyone who has previously encountered psychosocial developmental models eg milton developmental model of intercultural sensitivity or janet helms racial identity development theory
at mere pages how to be an inclusive leader is more handbook than textbook and so not expected to be comprehensive or highly detailed
even so there are few instances where it could be more rigorous
for example brown uses known mischaracterization of the violent sexual assault and murder of kitty ge no vese in as her sole example of the phenomenon of diffusion of responsibility closely related to the bystander effect and bystander apathy
br claim that one called the police or tried to

she acknowledges that the privilege walk puts less privileged participants in the situation of bearing the weight of the
this exercise has received important critique for its potential to out harm and shame participants bol ger eh ren halt sil iman tor res and relying heavily on it here struck me as irresponsible
brown does note that the exercise has few critical and includes reference to one of the critiques in the notes bol ger but again question her choice to feature it so prominently
these instances do not diminish the utility of how to be an inclusive leader but rather help illustrate the importance of one of key take aways we will all make mistakes and small our inclusion journeys
an ss en ti al corollary however is that we also need to be held accountable when those mistakes occur
this is particularly so of leaders whose power and journal of the international ombudsman association con ger position often mean that their mistakes or oversights have outsized effects especially on those most vu ln er able or mar gi na liz ed
as an experienced consultant brown has seen firsthand how critical it is that leaders sincerely engage inclusion efforts on personal as well as structural level if the efforts are to succeed
she also understands how dif fi cul or even dangerous doing so may seem to many leaders
instead of chastising them to simply do more or be better how to be an inclusive leader addresses leaders with clarity and empathy
thoroughly in line with contemporary research on leadership in gen er al brown emphasizes the importance of vulnerability humility adaptability and comfort with discomfort in the practice of inclusive leadership
she also stresses the need for systems approach perspective that can help one see beyond individual is su es to identify broader dynamics and patterns that may impede or enhance
finally brown unequivocally and repeatedly asserts the importance of taking action
if reader remembers only one thing from the book she says it should be that an inclusive leader you need to do something
how to be an inclusive leader belongs in every lending library is book you can feel safe and good about putting into the hands of any current or aspiring leader even those still on the fence about the value of inclusion or reeling from accusations of discrimination
if you are an om bud who facilitates reading groups at your organization or wants to start doing so this book would also be smart accessible selection for group of managers administrators or the like to engage
many om buds will also have much to gain from reading how to be an inclusive leader for themselves
while the earlier sections of the book provide some nice tools for working with visitors the chapter on he advocate stage of the inclusive leader continuum is what might resonate with om buds most vividly
brown describes this stage as being about flaws in system or process where bias
and insists that from being power les advocates at every level of company know how and when to ask powerful questions and to question norms as well as move conversations toward more public commitments to
brown never explicitly specifies who qualifies as leader but it is clear throughout that her definition is not limited to those with formal power
how to be an inclusive leader may be step by step guide but it will not tell you what policies to enact or meetings to hold to
rather it will bring you along journey of personal growth and perspective on how to use your power form it takes positive inclusive change
whether you are just beginning on that journey or have already traveled the road many times this book can be useful nd motivating companion

systemic conflict institutionalization assessment journal of the international ombudsman association raines harrison introduction being an organizational ombudsman can be lonely and practice can be exacting
for ombudsmen employee relations specialists and many organizational consultants every day can feel like the bill murray movie same problems different people
or worse yet we are confronted by the same problems caused by the same people
it feels like we are running in place stuck on the wheel of beer pac ka rd
each day organizational ombudsmen meet wi th visitors seeking help to solve problems that might be preventable if only their organizational culture were positive united and repellent to toxic workplace behaviors
when dysfunctional organizational cultures exist across an organization or within pe cif ic units predators are free to engage in inappropriate behaviors like sexual harassment bullying and disengagement raines
disengagement and alienation run rampant when problems remain unresolved
while listening to coaching and assist in individual visitors is foundational part of the ombudsman role it is akin to putting out fires while neglecting fire prevention
most ombudsmen could list the changes needed to liberate their organization from the emotional financial and inhumane costs of most types of recurring unproductive workplace conflict
th is article charts path toward relatively inexpensive positive culture change initiatives in and for organizations
as side benefit these tasks raise the profile of the office and create constituency committed to their continued success
this helps inoculate offices from elimination due to leadership change budget cutbacks or vindictively dysfunctional yet powerful individuals within the organization
according to peter dr uc ker and others eats strategy for br ea
until our organizations create affirming healthy mission focused cultures ombudsmen will continue to experience groundhog day at work
it should be noted that each organization defines the roles and duties of their ombudsmen with some org ani za ti ons limiting their tasks to meeting with and coaching visitors through individual or small group conflicts
in other cases ombudsmen offer feedback to the leadership offer needed training conduct assessments pertaining to morale and con and generally engage in broader range of activities designed to assess prevent and manage conflicts
ideally for preventable conflict to be prevented organizational culture will need attention and grooming by managers and leaders at all levels
if an ombudsman is contractually limited or prohibited from engaging in the full range of conflict prevention and management tasks then she or he may be able to use the information in this article to persuade others to take on these efforts possibly including human resource professionals and suite leaders
review of the literature culture is the foundation of organizations even though they may not be aware of it or attend to it regularly
strong supportive foundation bolsters innovation en gag em and mission attainment
dysfunctional soul crushing inhumane cultures assure mission failure
the following definition of organizational culture provides useful starting place for the arguments made herein and behaviors that contribute the unique social and psychological environment of an organization
organizational culture includes an organizations expectations experiences philosophy and values that hold it together and is expressed in its self image inner workings interaction with the outside world and future expectations
it is based on shared attitudes beliefs customs and written and unwritten rules that have been developed over time and are groundhog day is north american cultural tradition observed on february nd of each year
on this day groundhog is released from its den and if it sees its shadow and returns to its den then folklore predicts more weeks of winter
it does not see its shadow then folklore predicts an early spring
the movie by the same title shows weatherman caught in time loop forced to relive the same day until he gets it right
the title of this paper reflects the vu fee ling some ombudsman hav when faced with the same recurring challenges brought by different visitors because the roots of the conflicts often remain unaddressed
journal of the international ombudsman association raines harrison considered valid
also called corporate culture its shown in the ways the organization conducts its business treats its employees customers and the wider community the extent to which freedom is allowed in decision making developing new ideas and personal expression how power and information flow through its hi er archy how committed employees are towards collective objectives and it also extends to production methods marketing and advertising practices and to new product
an culture begins at the op
according to public opinion there is serious lack of trust in executives to listen to and address issues red mo nd williams
this means that many executives will never hear about issues that are truly affecting organizational culture
an office can help change that perception by providing safe retaliation free place to bring concerns where the guarantee of anonymity and confidentiality encourages employees to bring problems to light red mo nd williams
om bud sm of fi provide an invaluable service to leadership by sharing information about problems within the organization thus making them for within the workforce red mo nd williams
the literature is practically devoid of research which examines the links between the role of the office and culture change
one partial exception is howard work which calls for an model with broader range of interventions than many organizational ombudsmen typically consider
articulated research agenda for the ombudsman field which included the need for better systems of data gathering methods to analyze the financial and extra financial impacts of ombudsmen and generally to comm un ic ate the value of their role
this agenda does not explicitly include call to study the ability of the ombudsman role to impact organizational culture but some authors suggest this important linkage raines
why is organizational culture so important
organizational culture impacts mission achievement profitability innovation employee retention and motivation and even brand image raines
most organizations fail to measure their culture yet they co ns is tent ly measure the effects of culture such as employee turnover and litigation costs
whether leaders attend to it or not organizational culture will evolve
like garden it can grow vegetables and flowers that nourish people or it can grow weeds that waste precious resources and choke out desired outcomes
great strategy succeed in dysfunctional culture but mediocre strategy could triumph when followed by team with strong culture merchant
what about firing dysfunctional team members
them simply does not work as stand alone strategy to address an unhealthy workplace culture
discharging abusive or predatory employees must remain an option when they do not change their behaviors after coaching but it takes ore to change workplace culture
high performing employee is placed into poor culture she will leave or take on the behaviors of the low performing employees already there
this is done as survival mechanism since it is too frustrating to give to team boss or organization that gets in the way of its own success on regular basis
so the first rule of culture change is that you cannot hire your way out of bad culture
you must pro actively change culture from the inside out
the only exception may occur when the top leaders are replaced with the clear mission to change dysfunctional organizational culture
this usually results from crisis or raines
papa wells far go and the we in stein com pa ny to name few experienced leadership turnover due to high profile scandals in which company leaders were either directly culpable or they did not act to stop bad behaviors
their organizations have become infamous examples of dysfunctional cultures ead ing to brand damage and even corporate bankruptcy for some
wells far go has used this public relations nightmare to rebrand its organization with promise to create more ethical culture
for the rest of us the key is to measure journal of the international ombudsman association raines harrison the health of our organizational cultures and take steps to pro actively shape them so that brand damage and high profile change is not necessary
bullying is only one symptom of negative workplace culture but it costs us business more than million per year far re ll
chronic unaddressed bullying and repeated mistreatment of an employee is factor in at least percent of resignations according to employee exit survey data nam ie nam ie
worth noting that bully in one org ani zati on may behave well in different organization or when placed in low power position in dysfunctional culture she or he may ironically become the target of bullying
this mean that bad behavior should be tolerated just the opposite
no one in the organization should tolerate inappropriate behavior yet firing offenders without addressing the culture that allowed their behaviors to flourish will likely yield disappointing results
the rule refers to the idea that ten percent of employees will be ethical and refuse to engage in sabotage steal violate common ethics or otherwise engage in negative behaviors because they have strong moral compass
the other ten percent will undertake these negative behaviors every cha they get because they lack strong moral compass
to keep them in line the organization must monitor employee behavior and sanction violators
more critical is the eighty percent of employees whose behaviors are influenced by the workplace culture
in positive environment employees avoid malfeasance because they care about their performance and the mission and their peers hold them accountable
previous literature on institutionalizing the ombudsman role at the conference of the international ombudsman association in new orleans roundtable session focused on the closing of ombudsman offices with an eye to improving understanding about how to protect insulate and institutionalize the ombudsman role in order to improve its viability even in difficult economic times or through period of leadership change
the consensus was that the important work of meeting with visitors coaching and the pursuit of informal dispute re sol uti on all critical tasks had the unfortunate side effect of limiting the visibility of the office
there were concerns that more active and visible role might bring its own risks or scare away some visitors
however the takeaway was that the ombudsman should take critical steps to document and share the benefits of their work to the organization leaders in ways that protect confidentiality
few if any articles exist which explain how ombudsmen may institutionalize and protect their office from closure
this article hopes to help fill this gap with the full acknowledgment that more work needs to be done on this important topic
ombudsmen are sometimes tempted to keep low profile to avoid attracting attention to their role and its im pa ct due in part out of concerns about keeping the confidences and anonymity of visitors
yet this low profile means the office rarely has the impact visibility and coalitions of support needed to ensure its continued existence
number of mb uds men offices have been closed usually citing budget cuts or perception that these tasks could be carried out by other units in the organization for example bp closure smith college
diane levin notes never ceases to amaze me how all too often dispute resolution programs the very programs that actually save relationships time and money are the first casualties of budget shortfalls and cutbacks
more evidence that our work continues to be undervalued and mis unde levin
similarly another ombudsman notes benefits avoided litigation and improved climate are hidden
the real mistake is assuming that other programs like hr or can fill in for an ombudsman
although these programs journal of the international ombudsman association raines harrison may be familiar with the culture they cannot bring confidential neutral independent and informal expertise to kos ako ws ki
mary bliss conger finds that idealized model of ombudsman work purports only to be minimal ly prescriptive the what and not at all descriptive the how leaving between lived and ideal
one of the reasons for the space between lived and ideal experience is what conger calls three
there are three common misconceptions or myths that leaders tend to have about ombudsmen they are redundant they compete with leadership and they create more risk
these misconceptions can be addressed by educating leadership and ot he rs in the organization about the unique and supplemental role of an ombudsman by building trust with all departments and leadership and by relating to them what the ability to report means specifically and statistically to the organization on ger
no other office does what the ombudsman does and most could do more to deepen their impact by working to bring positive culture change to their organizations with the side benefit of creating coalition of support for the office of the om buds man
methods and sampling the information in this article builds on more than twenty years of working with public private and not for profit organizations as both an internal and external conflict management and collaboration specialist
while some private organizations prefer to remain anonymous the authors have worked with many federal and state government agencies hospital chains insurance companies accounting firms universities multi national corporations united nations bodies chambers of commerce coalitions of mental health networks literacy non profits family businesses professional associations and courts at nearly every level
for each organizational intervention or training the authors gather list of commonly oc curring conflicts from participants
many of the sources of conflict are surprisingly consistent across organizations eg workload distribution overwork communication conflicts in preferred work styles lack of trust and accountability intercultural management challenges and constant change while others uniquely reflect the challenges facing each organization due to market forces leadership changes andor organizational culture
this can be done by administering survey before the first meeting or by passing out cards during the first group meeting and asking participants to write one recurring problem they face on each card
then the ombudsman or organizational consultant can sort these into thematic categories share them with the pants and assure them that their time together will be spent addressing these concerns
the arguments in this article are built on more than two decades of organizational work mediating more than cases inside and out si de of the court system engaging in scholarly research authoring three books and more than peer reviewed articles
from this body of experience and based upon review of the relevant literature this article presents suggestions for ombudsman seeking to deepen the impact of their work while institutionalizing and protecting their jobs and offices from the buffeting winds of leadership change and budgetary challenges
by addressing the root causes of conflict in organizations raising the profile of th eir work and building coalition of support across their organizations ombudsmen can make systemic changes to create more effective and humane work places
institutionalizing and protecting the ombudsman role journal of the international ombudsman association raines harrison figure shows hierarchy of tasks commonly undertaken by ombudsman with the lowest levels of the pyramid occurring the most often
as ombudsmen engage in higher level tasks the potential benefit to the organization increases as will the visibility of the office and its per so
historically many ombudsmen have sought to limit the visibility of their offices in order to insulate them from the winds of political change or lack of support which might occur if organizational leaders view them as threat to their ability to carry on as
the cs ui te leaders as well as other upper managers may believe the ombudsman is there primarily to help front line employees vent or seek resolution when they feel their supervisors or co workers are treating them badly
by keeping low profile ombudsmen often fail to show their value to the leaders who determine whether their office continues to receive funding and political support
more importantly keeping low profile means that ombudsmen are likely to engage in the lowest level tasks shown in figure thereby spending their time primarily addressing the symptoms of conflict rather than addressing the underlying causes of conflict
like physician giving an aspirin for fever instead of looking for the er lying cause of the illness it seems to help for little while but then the patient gets sicker
helping individual visitors is important and by putting aside time for higher level tasks the ombudsman can make the deeper changes required to reduce th number and severity of organizational conflict while creating affirming and effective workplace cultures
figure are you ready to bring an end to groundhog day
specifically how can ombudsmen protect and institutionalize their roles while getting to the root causes of repetitive conflict
the good news is that impactful changes are not particularly expensive nor complicated
table outlines the core tasks used to protect and institutionalize the office of the ombudsman while addressing the root causes of recurring conflict in the workplace
journal of the international ombudsman association raines harrison table tasks for protecting institutionalizing the office of the ombudsman step record and report the activities impacts of the office the literature is replete with articles and resources to help ombudsmen track record and report how they use their time and to measure the impacts of their offices gad lin
at minimum most ombudsmen can catalog how many visitors come each year the type of problems they bring eg harassment discrimination and similar problems and the service provided by the ombudsman eg coaching facilitating problem solving conversation between parties or units referral to external med ia ti on or arbitration training reporting trends to organizational leaders
ombudsmen can ask each visitor to complete an online evaluation of the services they received
use this data to create an annual or semi annual report based on aggregate rathe than individual data
make this report available to organizational leaders and everyone else in the organization through the web site
this new information or advice yet anecdotal evidence indicates that many ombudsmen are not gathering and using this information for full effect bing ham et al
use this information to understand the root causes of conflict
this will be key to designing specific interventions
step create an advisory board the purpose of the ad vi sory board is to improve the flow of communication between the office and key organizational stake holders using face to face meetings occurring at least twice per year preferably quarterly
for example the ombudsman can use this time to share information about conflict trends she sees across the organization or to get feedback and build consensus around proposed initiatives to address the sources of systemic conflict
board members can share their observations about the sources of conflict nd make requests for training interventions or needed policy changes
these meetings allow the ombudsmen to educate key stake holders about the purpose tasks and impacts of the ombudsman office while allowing the stake holders to inform the ombudsman abo ut conflict trends or concerns
these meetings also allow the ombudsman to build the interpersonal rapport and support needed to sustain the office during difficult times including tight budget years when their offices may become preferred targets for cutbacks or closure
the goal is journal of the international ombudsman association raines harrison to produce true change rather than simply integrating different departments within the organization
mary ro we states that management systems do not lend themselves to but rather to coordination where groups can become familiar and therefore create an environment ripe for problem
well coordinated group which provides safe place for addressing conflict could become valuable asset to the organization
unlike group cohesion which encourages conformity feeling of psychological safety in group encourages risk taking because members feel safe sharing ideas ed mons on
coordinated cohesive and open advisory boards can help insula te the ombudsman office and personnel from the ire of any individual key stakeholder which may be piqued during any specific conflict resolution efforts
board composition will vary depending upon the mission and structure of each organization but most will include the directors of the offices of human resources and legal affairs
additionally if it is unionized workplace then union leader will be in dispensable
in university setting additional members would include the provost president leaders from the faculty and staff senates as well as someone from student government campus police and residence life dorms
the goal is to include at least one consistent representative from all major stakeholder groups including someone who represents front line employees middle management and upper management
representation of all stakeholder groups is critical to ensure others view the advisory board as legitimate unbiased and to keep it from becoming perceived as tool for organizational leaders to control the agenda
bylaws or other guiding documents are useful to describe the purpose composition and scope of the advisory and power
bylaws also protect the office from undue pressure which may occur if one difficult personality or particularly strong agenda takes hold on the board
typically effective advisory boards range in size from to members
larger boards become unwieldy and prone to internal strife or disengagement
step conduct conflict collaboration culture assessment with input from key stake holders before designing any specific interventions the ombudsman needs to conduct con and culture needs assessment
this is survey of the sources of repetitive conflict within the organization yet it may be better entitled culture since the use of the word tends to put leaders on the de fen si
it is much easier to convince leaders to assess the of than to get them to endorse although these are the same thing
while external experts often charge tens of thousands of dollars for this work it can be done well with just few short questions posed via anonymous survey technology
start by asking each member of the organization or representative sample of large organization to describe the culture of the organization as wh ole step and then the organizational culture of their specific work unit step using three descriptive words
common positive answers include affirming positive healthy effective invigorating collaborative friendly collegial results etc
common negative words often include soul crushing hostile mean inhumane competitive uncaring cluster
also consider scale of to where is and is how likely are you to recommend this company as place to work for friend seeking job
consider this follow up could the organizational leaders do to improve this score
the scaled question is helpful because it can be used to create baseline reading of the cul tur al health
once the culture change efforts are underway re test can be used to measure changes
there are many more potential questions one could include on an organizational cultural health survey to understand better the root causes of conflict disengagement litigation turnover and poor mission achievement
these sample questions journal of the international ombudsman association raines harrison show the afford ability and simplicity of conducting conflict culture needs assessment
while more thorough externally conducted evaluations may be helpful do not he sit ate to gather information when and where possible
this information will be indispensable in efforts to influence company leaders to make needed changes see step below
additionally be sure to interview advisory board members to gain their pers pe ct iv es about the sources of recurring conflicts
they may also have data which proves useful to the assessment effort such as the number and types of lawsuits and formal complaints filed against the organization eg in the us this would include claims of discrimination filed by the equal employment opportunity commission employee turnover or regulatory compliance failures
they will appreciate being heard and knowing their perspectives are valued
their buy in will be required when it comes to im pl eme nt ing needed changes so use this process to get some one on one time with them to deeply listen and build rapport
step becoming the boss whisperer jointly crafting culture change plan denial and defensiveness tend to keep organizational lea de rs from the greatest challenges to their organizations until it is too late
leaders at wells far go en ron and papa pizza are examples of what happens when they allowed the growth of toxic workplace cultures
in turn these cultures allowed bad behaviors to go unchecked or worse yet encouraged them eventually resulting in significant damage to their brands careers and companies
convincing organizational leaders to get on board with culture change initiatives is not as easy as should be but very important
take this opportunity to become who gently and effectively assists leaders to see the things that were previously invisible to darker parts of the culture that they have been try in hard not to see
schedule meeting with the highest ranking decision maker
this will be negotiation so appropriate preparation is key
their time is short so begin by building rapport and then dive in
arrive with list of requested action items or resources needed to bring change
consider bringing printed bullet points to share and to keep the meeting on track
as with all negotiations all parties need to make their interests clear
be aware they have both org ani zati on al interests eg mission achievement profits share price increase and individual interests eg promoting their reputations and careers
ask them to share their interests and be sure to frame any proposals and requests in ways that speak to all of their interests
this is key to becoming whisperer
surface and speak to all the interests in the room
in all difficult or important conversations be sure to convey before
the ombudsman should begin with an explanation of his her interests and motivations before conveying the content of the message
for example my hope is to see your new initiatives become wildly successful and take our organization and your reputation as leader to new heights
in order for that to happen believe we need to address problems with low employee morale and high levels of disengagement
could we brainstorm ways to address organizational culture concerns with an eye toward ensuring that your new initiatives hampered by these cha ll eng es
find out what they are afraid of as well as their aspirations
leaders often make decisions designed to minimize the risk of negative outcome but their ability to accurately assess the sources of risk are somewhat aligned with their scores the thomas kil mann conflict mode the term has been used by multiple previous authors and does not refer specifically to any one source
journal of the international ombudsman association raines harrison assessment or other similar conflict styles tool thomas and kil mann
this means that leaders who score high on accommodating or avoiding conflict styles are more likely to downplay the existence of organizational conflict and external threats raines
those scoring high on the competitive mode are likely to believe no one else but they can fix the problems that exist
they tend to be control oriented and authoritarian which often alienates team members
this information can be used for optimal impact
coaching them on delegation skills may help lay positive foundation for success in your efforts raines
using the information gathered in earlier steps summarize the organizations goal threats to those goals and path forward
the goals of the organization should include mission related points as well as those more focused on internal housekeeping
for example large urban food bank had these goals hungry people in cost effective efficient manner and create an inclusive positive impactful work environment for
then identify threats or obstacles to achieving those goals using the data gathered in earlier steps
do employees characterize the workplace climate in ways that are primarily positive or negative
describe trends in turnover engagement productivity and talent acquisition
is the organization struggling to hire keep and motivate good people
you cannot change the national economic environment but you can make your organization destination workplace meaning the kind of place people feel valued through affirming relationships and impactful work
many leaders discount bad news refusing to believe downward trends are real or that negative reports are accurate
you can chip away at this denial by conveying the strategic use of this information which can benefit them if they are the leader who is seen as having turned things around
tell them that high conflict environments provide much hanging meaning that small changes make disproportionately large impact
conflict is normal part of everyday life at work and home
the goal is to harness its power to bring constructive rather than destructive change
use met ap hors and analogies every garden and organizational culture grows something whether we tend to it or not
it can grow weeds or it can feed people
create recommendations to improve the organizational culture over the ear term months as well as the longer term years
describe the resources needed to bring these changes more on this later and make specific request for those resources
the return on investment is huge since positive culture will provide fertile ground for the success of more mission focused goals eg number of widgets produced patients treated clients served share price brand image etc
intervene to address cultural roots of conflict coaching visitors is foundational to the om buds man role
listening skill building conveying compassion and referral to resources often allow individuals to build the internal capacity and confidence to better manage their conflicts both inside and outside of the organization
it is the work of peace building along with parenting of course
additionally through their meetings with visitors om buds men are better able to understand the patterns and sources of systemic conflict in their organizations which helps provide the data needed for earlier steps in this process
yet if the majority of an om buds man time is spent meeting with visitors le vine fin ley they are likely to remain stuck with the groundhog day experience of reliving similar narratives and problems daily
to get off that hamster wheel of conflict om buds men must set aside time to engage in tasks more closely associated with conflict prevention
culture change is the highest level conflict prevention activity for om buds men
therefore the remainder of this article will focus on specific tools for bringing positive culture change through low cost activities which have the side benefit of raising the profile and showing the indispensability of the om buds office and its personnel

journal of the international ombudsman association raines harrison conflict comes from unmet expectations see project aristotle
few years ago go ogle completed large study designed to uncover the secret of effective teamwork
they compared the effectiveness of various typ es of teams hierarchically organized teams compared to flatter structures diverse and non diverse teams teams that socialized outside of work and those that did not teams that worked virtually compared to in person teams teams with similar educational fields and cross field teams intergenerational teams
they found that none of these variables consistently created successful teamwork
if one expects his her team to be friends then she is disappointed when they do not ant to socialize outside of work
if one expects strict hierarchy to be maintained then one particularly upset when directions are given rather than assistance requested
shared expectations arise over time through the painful process of trial and error
this is true in marriage in work and our communities
by facilitating conversation designed to create shared expectations amongst team members ombudsmen can address existing conflicts and prevent future ones
normalize and show optimism two or more people work or live together conflict is normal healthy and to be expected
have faith that if we or you work together we can find solution that works for us both or
conflict comes from unmet expectations would like each of you to share your expectations of how this would have gone or will go
make our implicit assumptions explicit by sharing our vision of project would get done how we would communicate how we would address problems that arose
negotiate shared expectations propose discuss and seek consensus about our or your expectations so we can work effectively together now and in the
work with the parties to create list of sha red expectations
common expectations may include partial list we will give negative feedback criticism privately rather than in front of others
if we cannot meet deadline we will communicate that in advance and work to minimize the negative mp act on work
if decision made in my unit impacts the work of other units then will discuss it with them in advance whenever possible
we will not give directions to employees who report to other supervisors without the approval of that super visor
we will admit our mistakes rather than hide them
we will apologize as needed and receive apologies with grace
we will invite constructive feedback regularly
we will take turns traveling and divide travel resources equally
we will not punish who stop the assembly line due to problem they found
we will hold each other accountable for deadlines and deliverables using humor and kindness whenever possible
after assisting group of two or more employees in the creation of shared expect at ions it is good idea to check back in one month to revisit them
what is working and what needs to be improved
convey that new habits take time to take root and everyone should expect setbacks and mistakes along the way as old habits rear their head from time to time
encourage the parties to openly discuss their progress admit their setbacks and support each growth
each time conflict occurs encourage them to go back through these three simple steps to depersonalize the dispute un cove hidden assumptions and expectations and create shared expectations going forward
journal of the international ombudsman association raines harrison tool who are we now and who do we want to be in the future
this is the most critical expectation for each individual unit as well as the entire organization
creating positive organizational culture begins with open honest inclusive and constructive discussions of we are and who do we want to be
leaders must balance their vision with the collective vision of their employees at every level raines
to create shared and legitimate answer to the are we and who do we want to questions ombudsmen can facilitate discussions with groups of employees at every level of the organization
if done in large group setting this works best by sk ing employees to break into groups of and brainstorm list of values statements that answer each of these two questions who are we now and whom do we want to be
then have them report out to the whole assembly while the om buds man captures these on flip charts or projected screen
with the help of the group gain consensus on values which represent we want to
keep these values in shared space
encourage employees to filter every policy product pro cess and interpersonal interaction through these values
how do these reflect who we are and who we want to be
if not explicitly discuss how to get from where we are now to where we want to be
this is the real work of culture change
it is not ex pen si but it takes courage and commitment
best of all it brings hope to employees who have lost hope
those who have become jaded disengaged or even actively obstructionist often gain hope through the process of giving input on these questions and proc es
change generally comes faster than expected as organizational members begin to change the culture beginning first in their teams and expanding outward in the organization as whole
tool culture change starts with each person in each unit
each person shapes the culture every day
as every therapist will confirm can only change what you think say and do
do not wait for others to change while lamenting the status quo
no one is coming to save the organization
roll up your sleeves and get started changing the organization and motivating others to do the same
even organizational leaders may be daunted at the prospect of culture change for fear it is slow an painful process
be forewarned those who currently benefit from the status quo culture want others to believe this is more true than it is
change can come over period of months years or not at all depending upon the process us ed
change begins when employees in each unit openly discuss and reach consensus about the norms that will guide their work and interactions
then they communicate these strategically to supervisors subordinates and peers
ombudsmen may assist through the proactive facilitation of these discussions within individual teams while seeking consensus on these values and norms at the organizational level
invite leaders to take part in these discussions but do not wait if they choose not to participate for any reason
these facilitated dialogues can start in each team and build to cross organizational dialogues
this common peace building activity has been used successfully in divided societies worldwide feller
when applied within organization it has tremendous potential to create unity around shared values and desired behaviors
have you ever seen highly dysfunctional unit within relatively health organization
or the opposite highly effective positive unit within dysfunctional organization
even if organization is mess if unit and coworkers treat each other well and function efficiently as team day today experiences at work will often outweigh turmoil caused by poor journal of the international ombudsman association raines harrison leadership
by encouraging and tat ing consensus building around shared norms and expectations in each unit we can make our work places better for everyone
even if organizational leaders are not on board each employee positively changes the culture in their unit by aligning their behav io rs attitudes and interactions with the cultural values they seek to encourage
wait for others to make things better
change begins with each of us
tool empower train and become an active bystander
once everyone is fa mi liar with the norms and expectations in their unit and the broader organization then empower them to support those behaviors through the setting of healthy boundaries and active bystander actions
active bystander is anyone who sees an unacceptable be havior or person in distress and takes actions to raines
active bystanders interrupt situations involving discrimination violence bullying intimidation harassment and unkindness using humor redirection or if need ed by placing themselves between the aggressor and the target
for example if one employee is flirting with another who is clearly uncomfortable third employee can interrupt the undesirable behavior by inserting him or herself into the conversation asking the tar get for help with fictional task or making an explicit statement such as bob mary seems like she wants to keep it professional
teaching and encouraging active bystander skills empower employees at every level to share the responsibility of shaping and creating the are conversation
person is therefore allowed to set reasonable boundaries for how he she they want to be treated and these boundaries are to be respected and supported by those at every of the organization
there must be low risk mechanisms for those seeking to report violations of these norms as well as willingness to discipline and re educate those who violate them
otherwise the answer to the are question becomes are an organization that claims to care about fair appropriate treatment but allows powerful people to prey on the less powerful with impunity
no one wants to work at such an organization except for the predators
these organizations are prone to li tig at ion turnover and high profile raines
in an earlier article kea sh ly argues for stronger role for om buds men as active bystanders
people generally rust ombudsmen and look to them as models of positive organizational behavior and citizenship
in her article kea sh ly correctly states that om buds men can model positive behaviors educate and train others to support positive norms and behaviors and encourage all organizational members to speak out when wi tn ess ing inappropriate behaviors as well as acknowledging and taking responsibility for their missteps at work often during coaching sessions
similarly ro we and ro we suggest specific bystander behaviors used to inform all set and enforce positive social norms at work
human resource professionals managers organizational leaders and ombudsmen must lead by example while encouraging employees to stand up for positive behaviors
active bystander skills are key to culti vat ing healthy effective workplace culture
training active bystanders raise the profile of the om buds role while empowering employees to create positive affirming culture thereby preventing many complaints turnover and litigation
conclusions when organizational ombudsmen support and facilitate systemic efforts to create positive workplace culture they bring change to the underlying root causes of conflict
by doing so they reduce the frequency of counter culture hostile and predatory be ha vi ors
in turn this reduces the number of disgruntled victimized employees who visit the office with similar tales of mistreatment
this breaks the groundhog day cycle while improving mission achievement and re humanizing the workplace
journal of the international ombudsman association raines harrison as added benefit the same tasks used to address the root causes of dysfunction in organizations also bolster support for the office and activities by exposing wider swath of employees managers and leaders to the key skills and processes bro ug ht to the organization by the ombudsman
meeting with and coaching individual visitors will always be foundational service provided by ombudsmen
yet by engaging in higher level activities see figure the ombudsman can deepen his or her impact ra ise the profile and build coalition of support for needed culture change which benefits everyone in the organization and ensures greater mission achievement

standards journal of the international ombudsman association wright miller introduction being an organisational ombudsman can be lonely and practice can be exacting
it is determinedly informal role without the heft of formal authority unlinked to conventional mechanisms of oversight and support yet bears the weight of expectation engendered by the press of individual needs and the substance of issues addressed
as organisational ombudsmen we are witnesses to allegation to fact to opportunities lost and gained to the best and worst of our organizations
if we are solitary practitioners we may find ourselves burdened by our unstated role as keeper of the
our operational independence may have us hesitating to acknowledge the significance of that burden andor the importance of having our work subjected to professionally appropriate degrees of scrutiny or monitoring
and even if we are not solo practitioners our current standards of practice may engender sense that sharing of case content beyond those instances where formal legal requirements may require information disclosure or permission has been granted and the has agreed to share some information in some sense challenges our legitimacy as truly independent confidential neutral or informal
in this respect issues of eva lu at ion and professional development may have been held hostage to standards of practice for which no formal accountability mechanisms exist
in other settings where independent confidential practice is the norm particularly but not only education so cia work and health professions has been long held as process that can strengthen practice standards and clinical competence improve accountability and promote restorative responses to the emotional weight of clinical practice new zeal an psychologists board
the authors believe that organisational ombudsmen would benefit in similar ways by receiving this type of support and guidance
it is the intent of this paper to recommend regular practice supervision as an essential element of ongoing organisational ombudsman practice and in support of the development of the profession
our hope is that this paper is catalyst for wider conversation about the development of regular practice supervision within the organisational om bud sm an profession
we begin with brief overview of the history and development of supervision models moving to the more recent requirement of supervision as an assurance of continuing professional development and competence
it is submitted that organisational ombudsmen would also benefit from supervision as support and as bulwark against the operational isolation our role can at times engender
having located work in the context of contemporary societal and organisational challenges we then present the findings of survey of senior ombudsmen with respect to how practitioners met their needs for guidance development and support during the earliest days of the profession including identifying the characteristics they valued as essential to supervision support model for
after then examining key aspects of supervision guidance coming from social work and clinical psychological associations and comparing them with the and co fo mentor ing programmes the authors propose some next st for developing the role of formal supervision for the organisational ombudsman profession
very brief background on professional supervision the purpose of providing some background information about supervision is to highlight how within profession al practice it has evolved from process of basic oversight of practitioners to include competence monitoring and assessment as well as self reflection and professional the international ombudsman association practice survey identified of organisational ombudsmen respondents as working in solo practitioner circumstances

also attributed to distinguished emeritus member james lee the terms and are all referenced in this paper
discussion of how they stand in relation to each other is given below journal of the international ombudsman association wright miller development including growing emphasis upon the support that it provides for kr elated challenges
supervision models evolved from the context of education social work and psychotherapy
main function of social work supervision in its early days was that of and reassurance that the profession was bein administered in accord with oversight standards kadu shin and hark ness
the development of social worker skills through supervision would come later bernard and goodyear and supervision really bloomed as field within social work in the latter half of the th century
in contrast to supervision arising from required adherence to administrative imperatives the development of clinical supervision appears to have been based more directly on the intended improvement of clinical compete and clinician skills
of course mental health developments in the th century reflect the rise of new treatment ideologies and practice so it is unsurprising that initial models of clinical supervision reflected models and frameworks of the psycho th practices being supervised
this was certainly the case with psychodynamic models of supervision as well as the person centered cognitive behavioural developmental and feminist models of mental health practice smith
some professional ass oc ia ti ons are explicit about the nature and purpose of supervision is defined as scheduled time to meet with respected professional colleague for the purpose of conducting self reflective review of practice to discuss professional is su es and to receive feedback on all elements of practice with the objectives of ensuring quality of service improving practice and managing impacts of professional work upon the supervisee
the reflective discussion deepens awareness of the link between th personal and professional identities of the supervisee and how these interact in her or his practice
supervision helps to promote competence confidence and
the emergence of new challenges in health has also seen the development of su perv is ion models in which one profession provides the supervision for another eg psychologists and social workers providing supervision for health advisers in the context of and leach french and miller
supervision has also been id en ti fi ed as crucial element in clarifying roles expectations and boundaries where health professionals work alongside and depend upon volunteers and to help ensure volunteer retention quality of care and psychological health miller
in summary supervision has evolved to encompass number of purposes in the helping professions including the monitoring of the administrative requirements of the work the oversight of practice competence the provision of support in managing work rel at ed stresses and challenges and professional development through reflecting upon the challenges of individual cases
in organizational settings supervision also enables the consideration of the challenges that organizational dynamics has upon meeting the of professional practice
why is supervision relevant for organisational ombudsmen
in his presentation of the first mary ro we lecture at the annual conference in miller noted phrase from distinguished emeritus member howard gad lin know what ombudsmen do we only know what they say they

data we do have come from journal of the international ombudsman association wright miller feel certain that most organizational ombudsmen do have their own ways of getting practice input testing theories and discussing di ff ic ult cases anyway it is just not mandatorily proscribed
also know first hand that solo remote ombudsman practice can be very lonely business especially when witnessing the idiosyncracies of bad faith organizational management or governance
stre ss can distort perspectives we all need to have our views supportively challenged to ensure good operational health
it helps to uphold standards of practice
of course mandatory mentor ing also necessitates that we agree on est practices for supervisors those doing the
while observation conflates mentor ing and supervision the authors submit that mentor ing and supervision are substantially different programs
it is however understandable that he se two programs are conflated
currently the mentor ing program responds to critical need providing support and guidance for inexperienced practitioners however there remains substantial void for more experienced ombudsmen or those who do not me et the criteria for having mentor
this void is filled by practitioners creating range of informal responses to meet the needs that come from taking up such demanding role in challenging environment
while there is overlap in relation to the some the goals of mentor ing and supervision major operational distinction which miller alludes to above through the use of the term is that supervision is more formal and structured process that contains elements of both mentor ing and the informal responses that have been created to fill this void
we examine further below this and other important distinctions between these two programs
the question of the relevance of ombudsman supervision may be seen in the context of om bud sm an training and licensing requirements
as things stand currently we have none
the role and title of organisational ombudsman are each conferred on those holding the role not by the but by the organizations for whom ombudsmen work
there are no form al minimum standards for ombudsman training other than for those who have voluntarily entered co op certification no mechanisms for accountability other than voluntary individual adherence to the ethical principles and standards of practice and on going assessment of ombudsman competence other than as co op maintenance
attendance at training courses and the regional and annual conferences and workshops is entirely voluntary
there are no formal reporting or skills updating re qu ire men ts
we do not know what ombudsmen do only what they say they do
more recently these issues were articulated by nick die hl past president of the in his guest post on the om buds bl og april following his observations at the annual conference in new orleans
in his post he reflects upon the state of the ombudsman field in particular highlighting major concern for the profession and one that was also raised by jon lee in his key note presentation to the conference namely how do we ensure the quality of service that ombudsmen are providing to their respective organ is at ions
die hl notes that particularly for solo practitioners and here the authors would include ombudsmen new to the field professionals are in position of self monitoring when determining the quality of professional practice including how standards are used to support practice
as well as professional practice considerations another important consideration is the operational and psychological he alt impact on organisational ombudsmen of doing the work they do

while there is great deal of research on the topic of compassion fatigue and burnout in range of helping professions the authors could find only anecdotal reports of the potential for psychologic al morbidity in organisational ombudsmen
however many have acknowledged the often very significant operational challenges face including multiple visitors in highly emotional states of mind exposure to the reportedly negative consequences of human behavior organisational labyrinths that seem to impede doing the right thing and for many the absence of close colleagues with whom to share such burdens

mentor ing one response by the to ombudsman practice challenges which enables experienced ombudsmen to informally support the quality of pro fess ion al practice of those new to the field has been the establishment of the mentor ing program
mentors have been available since to assist new ombudsman defined as members with no more than years experience make the transition to om buds ing positive and rewarding ex peri en ce
the mentor ing program may be especially helpful to solo practitioners who do not have the benefit of an experienced colleague to guide them through the murky waters of om buds
while rudolph and conn ell describe the mentor ing relationship as the chair of the mentor ing committee th oms on personal communication acknowledges the substantially informal and focus of the program
the mentor ment ee commitment is described in the for guide as normally involving monthly contact over period of year in which discussion can be flowing or topic depending upon the goals and needs of the ment ee
the coalition of fe der al ombudsman co fo also has mentor ing program that designed to assist federal om buds in practicing in accordance with the ombudsman professional standards of independence impartiality and confidentiality as well as the three common ombudsman characteristics of informality commitment to fairness and providing credible processes
co fo promotes mentor ing as way to further these goals by sharing om buds expertise best practices and by supporting the cross fertilization of ideas and approach es within the federal om buds
of note is that us federal agency ombudsmen served by co fo include external as well as internal including organizational ombudsmen and as such does not directly reference the standards of practice
under the co fo mentor ing program mentors and en tees meet for two hours monthly for months
mentors must have been full time federal ombudsmen practitioners for at least three years as well as being active in ombudsman professional development in co fo and elsewhere

it is the aspects of formality that detail process and standards define expectations including supervisory training and career long involvement and prior it ise the development of ethical professional competence that distinguish supervision from mentor ing
the authors acknowledge that making supervision an inherent mandatory requirement of practice introduces some sig ni fica nt considerations for the profession including the need for more sophisticated ethics process the development of standards of supervision and qualifications for supervisors consideration of introducing continuing professional practice training re qui re ment for all practitioners as well as some challenging discussions about aspects of the supervision process that involve oversight and evaluation of practice
however it is central thesis of this paper that formal model of supervision be implemented by the that incorporates the provision of support and the promotion of the professional development of practitioners as well as measure of accountability in relation to the quality of the ombudsman service provided
in this way formal supervision will contribute to the credibility and standing of the profession more broadly
the context of ombudsman professional practice what are the challenges
we are experiencing period of substantial change impacting all facets of society
these changes rise from complex set of interrelated circumstances some of which include technological advances the impact of climate change increasing levels of inequality the movement of people around the world fleeing conditions of war and poverty as well as rea ct ive short sighted and at times nationalistic responses by governments of all persuasions to complex societal challenges
the nature extent and pace of these changes has impacted landscapes in political systems around the world
politics has become mo re volatile partisan and adversarial at times resembling primitive battle as each side prosecutes its views with righteous indignation while demonizing anything that may represent difference or disagreement to these views
bipartisanship in the ser vic of civil society and the common good appear to be concepts from the past as communities are increasingly presented with political discourse and executive behavior characterized by incivility individualism and aggression
while we are seeing people fee ling more empowered to speak up about issues they might disagree with or comments that that they might find offensive this empowerment is regularly exercised via social media
the processes that are followed are often not constructive views expressed are often judgmental and divisive and parties are reportedly left feeling either not heard or victimized or at worst targeted and fearful in the face of sometimes extremist hate speech and violent imagery
one of the challenges that we face in con tempo life is that the skills and mind sets required to support constructive responses to difference and disagreement are in short supply
it is submitted that contributing factor to this is that culture of immediacy exists in which there are expectation that complex issues will be instantly resolved
yet emotional literacy is required to engage with these challenges including reflective capacity as well as empathy and understanding that each issue may engage multitude of different perspectives
in other words there is often no quick fix for many of the complex issues challenging society today

journal of the international ombudsman association wright miller the organ is at ions in which ombudsmen operate are in dynamic interaction with this environment
regardless of the sector or the geography organ is at ions are experiencing relentless and disruptive change that includes increased competition decreased re sou rc es and challenged leadership
the task of navigating organ is at ions and supporting staff through this turbulent operating environment is difficult and demanding one
it is therefore not surprising that organ is at ions are reporting increasing levels of st re ss decreasing levels of engagement and rising levels of bullying harassment and incivility
while this context presents incredible opportunities for the organisational ombudsman profession it also presents enormous challenges
never has the need for trusted independent and neutral program that provides safe place for leaders managers and staff to be heard and supported been greater
indeed never has the role of an ethical neutral and confidential resource been more important at the same time however never has managing and maintaining the political ethical and moral fundamentals of such program been more challenging
constant risk for the organisational ombudsman is that their role becomes instrumental is ed being seen as simply another tool of management in the service of outputs and outcomes
the authors believe that within the context of the environmental challenges described above this risk is heightened
the authors further believe that these contextual pressures are particularly amplified for inexperienced ombudsmen for new programs being established or where the organization may be looking to cut costs or avoid time consuming resource intensive about leadership or management practices
what we know is th at it is difficult to stand up to people in positions of power in both politics and also in organisational life
in this chapter the authors have argued that speaking up is even more difficult in contemporary society where dissent and disagreement are di scour aged and even closed down and in which culture of collusion and exclusion is promoted
in this environment organizations face existential threats to creativity to innovation staff engagement and critical and strategic decision making
the case of the nasa space shuttles challenger and columbia mcdonald and hans en and the en ron scandal mc lean and el kind are powerful historical examples of the risk to organ is at ions and society of this culture of collusion
more contemporary exam pl es include sexual harassment allegations at ox fam international and doctors without borders boe in gs apparent failures with its airplane as well as mc kins ey and reported actions in south africa
programs exist to provide critical ce in this environment
however it is the submission that without formalized and structured program of supervision supporting ethical and thoughtful practice this critical voice is at risk of being drowned out at best or corrupted at worst
developing case for the importance of an ombudsman supervision model from the early days of the profession organisational ombudsmen have been challenged to ensure competency of practice ie appropriate effective and ethical practice in keeping with th the impact of workplace stress and morbidity is frequently presented as financial cost

journal of the international ombudsman association wright miller sops and code of ethics of the in the face of the evident structural and environmental challenges encountered
to understand how early ombudsman practitioners responded to these challenges the authors asked small purposive sample of di sting ui shed emeritus colleagues about their career long experiences in obtaining supervision support and guidance in their practice
respondents were surveyed by email and their answers were collated and tabulated for quantitative thematic analysis
fi cal ly they were each asked the following questions when the need arose in your work as an who gave you support or guidance
was this support guidance formal ie built in to your contract or informal ie not built in to your contract
how did you find the support you were looking for what was the process you undertook for support guidance
in what ways did your support guidance help your practice as an
what characteristics in the support giver led you to seek their support
in view of your experience what do you think would be important characteristics of model for ombudsman supervision andor support
the respondents in the sample were chosen because of their experience and recognition by the profession as distinguished eme ritus members of the with their status guaranteeing that their service in the profession had been acknowledged for its high standard over many years
their service covered the higher educational research corporate and international agency sectors in europe and the united states
all had retired within the previous five years the most recent being months prior to this inquiry
formality informality only one of the seven respondents had supervision built into their formal contract all the others identified their supervision support as being informal ie there was no formal requirement or expectation that regular supervision occurred
that said some had costs of consultation andor conference attendance paid by their employer
sources of support and guidance an interesting aspect of the feedback from these colleagues was the development of support relying on informal contacts with peers

the overwhelming source of ombudsman support described reportedly came from fellow ombudsmen
add it io na specialist key colleagues eg legal counsel hr mental health personnel were cited as important sources by most and conferences the standards of practice and code of ethics were also frequently cited as sources of support and guidance
the contexts of support most frequently cited were regular meetings with peers
mentor ing from elders was also frequently cited as was input from specialist experts in companion departments and services
in all cases respondents identified that they needed to be proactive in engaging such support

another responded as follows were intellectually curious it was both contagious and validating they deeply understood the organizational culture of higher education within the us they seemed aware of nd were open to learning to manage their own biases they were accessible welcoming patient
one respondent located the added value of ombudsman support not in individual characteristics but in the organisational culture that fostered peer support and critique had nothing to do with the personal characteristics of those of us who participated in the process
we established an atmosphere that enabled us to give and receive critically supportive

if newly estab lish ed offices or existing offices decide to require regular supervision of their oos the supervisor could decide on the degree of supervision necessary in each particular
overall responses to this initial brief survey revealed some al elements that must be considered as the recommendation for formalized supervision is discussed
and it is noteworthy that survey responses with one exception conflated supervision with mentor ing support
as we will articulate in the next section there are critical distinctions between mentor ing supervision including the formality of the supervision process the mandatory aspect of the engagement and the links to monitoring and evaluation against professional practice standards
ration ale and recommendation for model of formal supervision for organisational ombudsmen while elements of the supervision model being proposed have been part of organisational ombudsman practice from the earliest days as detailed in the insights and suggest ions generously offered in the preparation of this paper by distinguished emeritus colleagues organisational ombudsman supervision as professional requirement would be new development in our currently unregulated profession
what are the key character is tics of the model
as well as taking into account information provided by distinguished colleagues and mentor ing schemes within the and externally though under the the authors believe that the experience of companion professions provides important insights when considering the establishment of supervision requirement and role
the authors have chosen the fields of social work and psychology as companion professions in part because they represent the primary professional training of the authors ut more importantly they were informed by the belief that the fundamental nature of om buds work is emotional labour
whilst om buds come from range of occupational backgrounds and benefit from range of conflict resolution legal organisational and pe op le related skills at its heart the authors believe that om buds work is about working with people under significant emotional stress many of whom are in crisis
om buds work is about creating an environment that supports people to attend to their emotions while at the same time reflect upon the complex dynamics of their experience and plan an informed and constructive course of action
the authors consulted the professional supervision guidelines of the new zealand psychologists board the australian association of social workers aa sw and the us national association of social workers na sw to identify key elements of formal professional supervision in those contexts see comparison table appendix
we noted that some professional boards have the parameters of supervision determined at least to some degree by legislation designed to enable public assurance of pr act it ione competence
in the realm of organisational ombudsmen their operations are mandated not by law but by in new zealand psychologist supervision guidelines are designed to fulfil assurance of practitioner competence under the health practitioner competence assurance act
for the aa sw active participation in supervision is core practice standard
journal of the international ombudsman association wright miller organisational policy
practitioners are reliant upon whether the issue of supervision andor support has been considered as an organisational pr er eq ui site during the development or upon whether and to what extent it is priority of the individual om buds or senior management
despite the legislative basis of the supervision guidelines as with the co fo mentor ing program the ui de lines recommendations rather than mandatory
which are considered to supplement the code of ethics
that said it remains practice requirement that all psychologists undertake regular formal supervision
for social worker in australia the aa sw determines that active participation in supervision is core practice standard with the practice of supervision guided by core values articulated in the code of ethics
for both professions supervision has an important role in elation to developing professional practice and upholding the professional code of ethics
indeed supervision is considered key process in supporting the profession
in this vein the guidelines draw distinction between supervision as monitoring and reporting on performance which they emphasize less than supervision as peer support for professional development
within each of these guidelines the implementation of professional supervision is expected to be career long and for the it tou ch es on all aspects of work ie client contact research professional continuing education and managing psychologist practice
additionally modes of supervision in these professions whether supportive questioning reflective corrective educational or challenging may multiply and intersect at the same time changing as the needs of the supervisee changes and as the supervisory relationship evolves
significantly the guidelines emphasize that self reflection is cor ne rs tone of supervision and functions as means the employer can fulfil their obligations as good employer to address occupational
in an era in which communicate and share experience across cultures countries and time zones all guidelines consulted emphasize supervision as means of supporting and nurturing cultural competence in professional development
the authors have reviewed the professional guidelines as well as the co fo and mentor ing models and id en ti fi ed some essential elements for an effective supervisory relationship
these include climate of trust safety and mutual respect an expectation of honest open questioning demonstrated interest tolerance of uncertainty and ambiguity elicitation of re gu lar and constructive feedback experiential learning approaches recording monitoring and evaluation of the process
brief comparison of such characteristics across three relevant professional associations is provided in table
also supervisory comp et are described in the reviewed guidelines as including the following creating safe environment for supervise es men tees responding respectfully to individual styles and capacities feeding back constructively while showing empathy and es pe ct non judgmental validation of experiences modelling ethical principled professional conduct and boundaries attending to supervisee personal wellness issues as they impact professional conduct attending appropriately to cultural and diversity issues journal of the international ombudsman association wright miller encouraging supervisee awareness and reflection on the consequences of their impact on others reviewing the supervision process and impact regularly exploring values and difference believing supervise es are willing to learn
formal pro gr of supervision support are an integral part of professional practice across many other professions
they fulfill critical functions including supporting new and inexperienced practitioners supporting practitioners in isolated roles supporting the welfare and wellbeing of practitioners in challenging roles contributing to raising professional practice standards contributing to credibility of the profession supporting the consistency reliability of practice promoting model of cont learning and reflective practice improving the effectiveness of interventions assisting new programs to consolidate and establish themselves feedback in relation to the early drafts of this paper highlighted an area of great passion for many of th experienced practitioners who provided feedback ie the current state of the ombudsman profession in relation to adherence to the practice standards
given this supervision was seen as important for addressing issues of accountability assessment and evaluation particularly for ensuring consistency of ethical practice and thereby protecting the standing of the profession in the community
while the authors acknowledge that implementation of formal supervision program creates the opportunity to monitor and asses practice standards wright has previously identified that under conditions of stress and organisational pressure supervision can become overly focused upon accountability issues at the expense of support and development
in other words if balance of objectives is not achieved the supervisor is at risk of being perceived as the
the authors firmly believe that the main focus for supervision should be the creation of safe place for potentially contentious is sues to be thought about
growth and development can only occur where the professional feels safe to be vulnerable in exposing challenging aspects about their work
while there needs to be enough robustness in the supervisory relationship to enable chal len ge the purpose of that challenge is to facilitate growth and development
for the authors this means guiding rather than directing nurturing the process of adherence to standards although in the most serious cases referral to an ethics committee or et hi cs process for further consideration should be an option available to the profession miller
additionally there will likely be different priorities dependent upon the nature of the supervisory relationship eg is the contract with the org ani sation or the individual is the supervisor part of the organisation or external is the supervision contract one off and case specific or short or longer term
supervision contract for organisational ombudsmen based on the model provided by the is illustrated in appendix
conclusion and next steps journal of the international ombudsman association wright miller the content and functions of formal supervision are important for the still relatively new profession of organisational ombudsmen and as such the authors recommend the following as key next steps to develop the role of formal supervision in this milieu an organisational conversation and enquiry we recommend that the international ombudsman association commences an board mandated conversation and enquiry with the membership about the deve lop ment of formalized program of supervision support for the ombudsman profession
as has been described such an enquiry will likely find that much and even possibly most practice involves informal support and supervision processes
we contend ow ever that formalizing existing processes is an important next step in asserting the professional standards credibility and advancement of the organisational ombudsman profession
using inputs from the and co fo mentor ing programmes and with en co ura ged input from practitioners with experience conversation with the membership will help to explicate the and by which such formalizing can realistically happen and by its existence hopefully add weight to the importance of it being done
additionally such conversation could help to clarify where administrative responsibility for formal supervision could reside eg as board function or under the co op programme or elsewhere
establishing best practices for supervision we fur th er recommended that work commences to establish principles of practice for organisational ombudsman supervision grounded in the code of ethics and standards of practice as well as taking the best from companion supervisory standards and documented experiences
some practical considerations to be addressed include how supervision is appropriately contracted and who has responsibility for it being so eg the the employer or the individual practitioner how supervision models can ensure cultural appropriateness while also ensuring rigorous and consistent professional standards expectations of the frequency and duration of supervision meetings appropriate potential goals of supervision and options in relation to the processes th at can be undertaken to achieve them how can supervisors be best prepared to supervise how issues of inappropriate or unethical practice by supervise es or supervisors are to be addressed protocols about confidentiality and managing confidential inform ati on in supervision
researching implementation of ombudsman supervision it is further recommended that the formulates parameters for researching implementation of supervision protocols and models within the membership especially examining outcomes ass oc ia ted with supervision and mentor ing support
in particular research could guide evolution of future approaches that may help to maximize ombudsman self care that support culture specific supervision design and that assist with development of sus tai na programmes in different occupational contexts
in summary the authors submit that supervision should be part of each individual commitment to continuing professional development to appropriate self care and implemented by the as an integral aspect of ensuring the maintenance of professional organisational ombudsman standards

history journal of the international ombudsman association smith the decade of the witnessed rapid change on college and university campuses throughout the united states
with an influx of students the deepening us involvement in the vietnam war and the end of in loco parentis demands that their rights be upheld became even more vociferous
in addition to this universities were growing rapidly
the idea of the multiversity emerged during this time universities were becoming increasingly complex ins ti tu ti ons with students easily lost in the bureaucracy
university administrators in searching for attempts to quell the student unrest looked to an idea that was gaining popularity around the world the ombudsman st ie ber
early campus offices wer established to resolve student issues but the practice quickly evolved to encompass the entire campus community
upon learning of the role faculty and staff saw the benefits of om buds services as well
as early as campus om buds as opposed to student om buds was widely accepted
still today there are many variations on how academic om buds practice including the populations they primarily serve
this paper will seek to examine these early offices that served students and the shift towards ng with broader campus population
the first campus om buds the first om buds office in north america was established at simon fraser university in and the first in the united states was at eastern montana university in
this was quickly fol lo wed by offices at stony brook university michigan state university and san jose state college
the author of college and university business article noted that these early om buds were not in communication with one another and guessed that they ma not even be aware of one existence
the om buds idea spread rapidly however and by there were between and offices throughout the united states bottom
handful of offices were established in direct res po to demands for civil rights on university campuses the first being at san jose state college another at the university of connecticut bottom
the original position posting from san jose state college in stated duty of the ombudsman shall be to search out and facilitate the removal of discrimination on the basis of race creed or national bottom
the first om buds was in the position for two years
when the position was re posted in there was no reference to discrimination and the posting more closely resembled positions for om buds positions at other institutions bottom
the vast majority of these early offices however can be attributed to the tumult of the time
in california governor ro na ld reg an urged the of hard core rebels by remedying legitimate student grievances thus denying the rebels of temporary allies
student administration communication should be constantly reg an quoted in anderson
two or national commissions presidential commission on campus unrest named the scran ton commission as well as carnegie commission both suggested om buds models for handling campus disputes in response to campus wide protests carnegie com miss io presidential commission
the first office established with the mandate to serve the entire campus community was established at cornell university in cook cook
this broader scope was over time the term ombudsman has been replaced by non gendered terms such as om bud om buds or ombudsperson
while there is currently no consensus on the appropriate term will use the term ombudsman in the historical sense and in quoted material wh il referring to the role in general and in the present as om buds
thoughtful exploration of this topic was conducted by ras ch
journal of the international ombudsman association smith outlined in the report that called or the creation of the office stating the office was to be available all members of the university wishing to present any grievance that may arise against the university of anyone in the university exercising cook
of the cases and inquiries for information handled by the office in its first year approximately half were from students cook
the classical roots of the campus om buds the creation of the danish folk et in gets om buds mand or parliamentary commissioner in spurred worldwide movement towards the creation of civil om buds
although the swedish om buds had been in place since two things made the danish model so appealing
the danish om buds was unique in that the role did not deal wit judicial administration
the om buds could not overturn judicial decisions and relied more on soft power relationships and persuasion than in the swedish model
the second was the officeholder himself
professor stephan the first danish parli am commissioner wrote and spoke widely on the subject acting as sort of worldwide evangelist and model for the om buds role gell horn
this movement sparked the establishment of om buds in new zealand in nassau county in new york in and the state of hawaii in st ie ber
the phenomenon of ombudsman ia carried on into the and it was in this context that the first college and university om buds offices were foun ascher
early om buds defined themselves in contrast to the role of parliamentary om buds
roland stated the modern day ombudsman has been defined as an independent high level officer in civil government who receives complaints rom citizens inquiries into the matters involved and makes recommendations for suitable action
his remedial weapons are persuasion criticism and publicity
he cannot arbitrarily reverse administrative action
this description also fits the campus om buds man except that he is an independent faculty member who receives complaints from students at college or university
early om buds also looked to parliamentary models for guidance when establishing new offices
james rust the first ombudsman at michigan state university found walter ombudsmen and other to be valuable resource
the book published in surveyed vario us parliamentary om buds models across the world
as additional universities established om buds offices they looked to other campuses for guidance and best practice rust
research and the development of best practice the rapid increase in the num ber of university om buds offices was accompanied by flurry of research into the new subject of academic
four doctoral dissertations written between and lay much of the groundwork for research conducted over the course of the next ec ade
the first in depth research project on university om buds was dissertation study examining the role at michigan state university in
the author of the study howard ray roland outlined that his study was exploratory in nature and attempted to analyze the structure and operation of various offices in an attempt to define the role and propose model for the campus om buds
rowland interviewed six campus om buds and surveyed students who had utilized om buds services at michigan state university owl and
rowland attempted to outline model for the campus om buds
the rowland model was rigid however based upon the few offices that he could study
many of these early offices were similar in structure based on the danish model and built upo information provided by other om buds
rowland ultimately outlined features that he believed should be incorporated into university journal of the international ombudsman association smith om buds role
these features included the ideas that the role should be limited to two years the om buds should only wo with student complaints and that the incumbent must be tenured faculty member rowland
norman bottom interviewed ten campus om buds as part of his dissertation study
seven of those ten shared that they would assist students faculty and staff
some had also shared that they will assist individuals who do not have an affiliation with the university as long as they have university related issue
bottom stated office that limits itself to one clientele risks losing the respect and trust of the other campus
the ability to work with multiple constituent groups also lies in the independence as an office
bottom took issue with the rowland model stating that it not really model for an ombudsman but rather for student grievance officer who has faculty status
the model is clumsy overblown and too
bottom suggested that the rowland model which was widely disseminated at the time only be harmful to future development of the office on american
another dissertation published in by agreed with bottom suggesting model that was accessible to all members of the campus community
broad based historical study by surveyed academic om buds offices
of those offices were student only offices
the remainder served mix of students faculty and staff across campus
the limited data available indicates growing acceptance if not practice of the growth of into the faculty and staff realms
even as early as mund inger wrote that the ombudsman is primarily conceived of as protector of students his office should be available to members of the
thus it was relatively early on in the field of academic om buds ing that scholars began to point out the value of serving the entire institution
stam ata kos and is ach sen wrote institution serious in intent to protect the entire college community staff as well as students from administrative and bureaucratic dysfunction would provide the ombudsman with an appointment indicative of the support of the entire institution and with provision for independence from that
the ability to work wi th the entire community gives rise to the independence and consequently the independence comes from their ability to work with the entire campus community
when an om buds is selected through process where all of these stake holders have np ut into the process the position will carry the necessary weight to impact decisions informally hamilton
relationship with student affairs professionals the rise of the campus om buds coincided with rapid change in the role of the dean of st ud en ts
the concept of in loco parentis began to erode when students were guaranteed due process rights in campus disciplinary proceedings after the dix on alabama supreme court decision and was effectively killed in after the passage of the th amendment to the us constitution
some scholars at the time predicted the decline of deans of students kos ter
the role of dean of students was rapidly evolving from that of the chief disciplinarian to one focused on providing holi st ic support to students in and out of the classroom
overall student personnel workers were skeptical of the role
earle clifford the dean of students at rut gers university said in an address to conference devoted to the idea of om buds in higher education that the creation of an om buds office was like penny in fuse box when circuit has clifford
calling the om buds clifford feared that the establishment of an om buds office ld send the signal that no real solutions could be found within the existing structure of an organization and the creation of this office was tantamount to admitting defeat
instead of om buds clifford advocated for journal of the international ombudsman association smith universities to reexamine the condition that made them necessary in the first place including excessive bureaucracy and administrators who were unwilling to help students clifford
the nature of the position led to some cross pollination with om buds coming from deans of students ran and vice versa
individuals who served in both of these roles outlined substantial differences including the fact that the dean of students was part of the bureaucracy and led an increasingly large staff
the om buds by contrast was ge neral ly removed from university bureaucracy had broad scope and could assist students with academic and non academic issues
the informality of the om buds role also delineated it from the role of dean of students which oversaw an increasingly formal disc ipl in ary process eddy eddy kl ep per drew kos ter
ultimately the shift in focus from an om buds who serves only students to one who serves the broader campus may be what helped to delineate the om buds from the student personnel worker
had om buds continued to serve only students it is possible that the role would have simply been folded into the po rt folio of the dean of students or chief student affairs officer
the accessibility of an om buds to students faculty and staff sets it apart from other roles on campus and this accessibility has helped to contribute to the growth of the om buds field
maturation and the growth of the organizational om buds the shooting of unarmed student protesters at kent state in in combination with the reduction of us forces in vietnam saw pacified campuses in the early and shift in the role of om buds from negotiator between activist student groups and administrators to one who focused more on individual student and increasingly faculty and staff concerns griffin
as the role continued to evolve into the st ie ber noted ar campus ombudsmen who handle complaints and grievances of faculty and other employees as well as students
it is more common however for the staff some of whom may have been organized in unions to have separate channels for
the con ti nu ed evolution of the university om buds also coincided with the development of the corporate om buds
by it was estimated that there were over corporate om buds in north america ro we
corporate om buds were described by ro we as tr al or impartial manager within corporation who may provide confidential and informal assistance to managers and employees in resolving work related concerns who may serve as counsellor go between mediator fact finder or upward feedback mechanism and whose office is located outside ordinary line management structures
when compared with the rowland definition provided earlier this definition demonstrates the evolution within the field and contrasts early om buds with their corporate
additionally where university om buds outside of the united states had numerous civil counterparts to which they would look for examples private sector om buds greatly outnumbered public sector ones in the united states
these differences led to unique trajectory for the profession within us colleges and universities st ie ber
as both the corporate and university om buds models continued to evolve the two would eventually converge to create what is today known as the organizational om buds
in addition to the evolution observed within the role of the om buds there was evolution within the university as well as it adopted increasingly managerial staffing practices st ie ber
this also led to increased linkages between om buds and he field of alternative dispute resolution
as the journal of the international ombudsman association smith population served by om buds expanded so did the complexity of the power dynamics among them griffin ko lb
ultimately the convergence of the university om buds and the corporate om buds was solidified by the unification of the two professional organizations
the university and college om buds association and the ombudsman association merged to create the international ombudsman association in
college and university om buds then became co uc hed within the broader organizational om buds field
looking forward best practice and recommendations little research has been conducted on the current status of academic om buds ing in the united states however one could presume that the landscape is varied as ever
one element of university om buds offices that has remained consistent is that each office will be different
these differences can be ascribed to the environment of the campus to the individual holding the position as well as to who req the office in the first place
today forward thinking chief student affairs officer may create student focused om buds position in response to requests from students provost may create separate position in response to resolutions passed by the faculty senate or university administration may create single office for the entire campus
each of these om buds should operate in similar way but the work may be very different
one of the challenges for the om buds field is that it is reliant those who may or may not understand what an om buds does to establish define and hire for each position in an entirely new and unique context
that being said the variation among roles and institutions should not be surprising
the international om buds man association has documented best practice that state that an om buds should report to the highest level of an organization however this structure is not always possibility and these roles are often established in response to specific need request
the origin of the role of the university om buds is complex serving as bulwark against violations of student rights and intermediary between students and university administration it was product of its time
om buds have adapted to change in university and societal culture and part of this has been change in the populations that they serve and the methods that they use
it is helpful to recognize the roots of the field and the elements that continue to make college and university om buds unique within the broader context of the organizational om buds

students university higher education journal of the international ombudsman association burton introduction the title of this article comes from the very first report of michigan state office of the university ombudsperson in which the om buds compares the role of the om buds as help ing students to take against sea of hamlet with reference to the faculty and administration as the sea and arms being the solutions to complex problems
albeit unique and confrontational observation it hardly describe the scope and dep th of the work of this office during those early years
th present research began as an effort to revisit and reflect on the legacy of the fifty years of om buds practice at michigan state university since
reflecting on this early history helps the ie ld better understand how and why the office was initially established and the complexities in how the field continues to define its role
the office of the university ombudsperson remains the longest standing om buds office at any college or university in the united states with the sixth om buds taking office in
to effectively understand the role scope and purpose of the office the researcher examined the annual reports provided by dr james rust michigan state first university om buds man and his colleagues that covered the years of through the end of his tenure in august
to provide more comprehensive context for these documents additional reports and papers produced during that time were consulted
these supplementary documents included dissertation done in by rowland doctoral student at harvard university who interviewed rust during his research an interview in parade magazine as well as rust own papers
finally interviews were conducted with former staff member of rust and close friends of his who also worked at the institution
comprehensive list of these documents is available in the references
these early years of om buds practice focused on establishing the office within the university and developing the means for training in and an understanding of the role
through the review of the documents key themes related to these issues emerged
these included staffing practice and relationships and student problems and trends
many of these themes still dominate discussions around the work today and the paper will naturally posit questions in this space
et us begin however with why and how the office was created
definition of the role the first college or university in the united states to have an om buds office was eastern montana college which operated on year to year basis beginning in the jan zen
the last record of the office was in the campus bulletin eastern montana college
eastern montana col lege later became montana state university billings in billings
state university of new york stony brook had also established an office slightly before that of michigan state university in in response to campus demonstrations by students not given enough information on university policy and plans
su ny stony brook had appointed three faculty members as ombudsmen at that time
however in the following summer it was placed par ness and did not emerge again until the academic year su ny
the reason for this nebulous position is given as of opinion concerning the people to whom the ombudsmen should be
the ombudsmen at su ny stony brook felt they were responsible to th students and faculty while the president felt they should be accountable to his office par ness
despite these setbacks by various institutions at the start of fourteen institutions had created om buds offices and by the first meeting of co and university om buds in october of fifty already existed rowland
rowland described the role as an independent faculty member who receives complaints mainly from students at college or university
he makes inquiries and re comm ends appropriate action
his remedial weapons are persuasion and his objective is to improve rather than replace the existing the ombudsman has no staff considers student academic journal of the international ombudsman association burton and non academic problems is not involved in student di sci pli nary matters and has more investigatory authority
in his paper rowland outlines the key skills of the om buds knowledge of campus operations and regulations understanding effectiveness authority and accessibility
he also notes that students are turning to more legalistic definitions of their rights rowland
as result om buds serve an accountability function within their institutions as an auxiliary to not replacement for existing processes rowland
one key facto in this piece is that the om buds reports directly to the president and in some cases the student body president
during these early beginnings although few had professional training or experiences in student personnel work they did share familiar it with their campuses and concern for justice
rowland also notes their additional attributes of prestige personality and their persuasive power that they brought to the table
as such many om buds seemingly saw their roles as change agents and cat al ys ts in bringing about structural alterations
ultimately the office of the university ombudsman now ombudsperson at michigan state university was created through report of the academic council committee on student affairs to the academic council on february and ro mulga ted during the following fall rowland
the academic freedom for students at michigan state university report now titled the student rights and resp on si bi liti es and often referred to as the academic freedom report in university documents provided regulations for guiding student conduct and due process in adjudicating cases
the office of the university ombudsman would be the key in ensuring the effectiveness of these new processes
establishment of the office and role emerging from time of civil unrest and protest during the vietnam war michigan state office of the university ombudsman was created in response to the filing of suit by for mer student paul sch iff and the american civil liberties union aclu in which he alleged his dismissal from michigan state university was due to his involvement in the committee for student rights which challenged issues related to the adm in ist ration
participating in the committee he wrote publication called logos which was distributed in the residence halls
the university held that this was violation of an ordinance covering the distribution of advertisements brat tin nd nd eventually revoked his student status and disallowed his return to campus
judge fox however found that after due consideration of the cases which have been cited by counsel and of cases which have been examined separate and apart from those cited counsel this court is satisfied that temporary injunction as such would not be justified at the present time
it is the opinion of the court that this matter should be handled by the authorities at michigan state university without court order ex ce pt as later developments may point out the necessity for action by this or some other court
in the opinion of this court the defendants or those charged with the appropriate duties should furnish to the plaintiff within ten days letter setting for th in sufficient detail the reasons for rejecting the plaintiffs application for readmission as graduate student in history
after receipt of such letter plaintiff should be afforded ten days thereafter in which to present to the administration reply including any affidavits which he may wish to attach thereto setting forth his claims in opposition to the reasons given by the administration for rejecting his application
within ten days after receipt of the plaintiffs reply above referred to pl ai nt iff should be afforded an audience with the appropriate administrative authorities of michigan state university charged with the final determination of the acceptance or rejection of his application for readmission
such audience shall be conducted in ac cor dance with the journal of the international ombudsman association burton guidelines laid down in dix on alabama state board of education supra
the key words in this opinion that would lay the groundwork for the creation of the office of the university ombudsman was the statement as later developments may point out the necessity for action by this or some other
as well as reference to dix on alabama state board of education the landmark us federal court decision that spelled the end of the doctrine that college and universities could act in loco parentis to discipline or expel their students
dix on alabama state board of education also established that students could not be expelled without due process
as result mr case was brought back to th university to redetermine
in their december minutes michigan state academic senate addressed the progress in rehearing the case within university regulations
it was in these notes that vice president john fu zak dean of students and later vice president of student affairs noted that the members of his staff and the committee on student affairs were trying to bring the rules and practices for student government in line with due process and that they were working the associated students of michigan state university in order to accomplish the same end in those cases where the students were privileged to make rules and establish practices
to this end the academic council committee on student affairs which ad vised the university on all matters related to the academic achievement of students deliberated leaning heavily on the report of committee of the american association of university professors dress el in particular the recommend at io ns surrounding the of faculty for procedural due process in cases of alleged which states the faculty has an obligation to see that students are not disciplined for alleged misconduct without adequate procedural safeguards
the following procedures are recommended to assure reasonable protection of the student fair determination of facts and the application of appropriate sanctions aa up
the procedures included notice of conduct subject to conduct of investigation preliminary to formal charges notice of charges treatment of student pending final action hearing further recourse ultimately the academic council committee on student affairs for michigan state university drafted sta te ment that was approved by the board of trustees on march dress el
in it the academic council committee on student affairs documented that students hold in the sense that they are still part of broader while also being part of the university
the university can thus not deprive student of civil and societal rights
as critical part to this principle the committee recommended the creation of the office of the university ombudsman to op er ate with both formal procedures and personal dress el
the ombudsperson was put into place to safeguard the rights and responsibilities of the students
according to article viii of the report the president shall appoint from the senior faculty high prestige official with the title of ombudsman
the sensitive and confidential nature of the work dictates that he conducts his operations with dignity and integrity
he shall respect the privacy of journal of the international ombudsman association burton all persons who solicit his assistance and protect them against retribution
his functions shall include the following charges he shall establish simple orderly procedures for receiving requests complaints and grievances of students
he shall assist tu dents in accomplishing the expeditious settlement of their problems
he may advise student that the request complaint or grievance lacks merit or that the student should seek his remedy before another duly constituted body or officer of the university or the ombudsman if he deems it appropriate may assist the student in obtaining an informal settlement of the problem
in the performance of his duties the ombudsman shall have broad investigatory powers and direct and ready acce ss to all university officials from the president down
when the ombudsman deems it necessary he shall report directly to the president valid complaints for which no remedy has been found
he shall also report any recommendations he wishes to make regard ing such complaints
he shall make periodic reports to the president regarding the operation of the office
the notion of was particularly important to the ability to serve as om buds
as noted by mund inger in sense the ombudsman should represent brooding presence to which an aggrieved member of the university could appeal in the confidence that the ombudsman is man of established integrity and reputation whose sole concern is the advancement of justice and equity in the campus community
additionally the establishment of om buds to address student concerns at time of great change in higher education was not novel to michigan state university
as result other institutions began to examine the om buds ole as response to increasing bureaucracy for not only students but faculty and staff too as students become part of large bureaucracies there will be instances of red tape mishandling denying students their proper rights
the mere operation of lar ge bureaucracies often is detrimental to the individual
isolation of the individual from decision making and power is too complete
the problem is to protect his rights and personality schloss berg
furthermore although this office would not necessarily be in student personnel it seems student service workers would be logical group to push the concept
after all this group is most clearly associated with students and most conscious of their mishandling and tangling with red tape schloss be rg
as the om buds would impact the relationships between students and the university in theory how did michigan state university begin the selection process of someone with to address the
according to rust anderson the process had the provost soliciting nominations from the deans from faculty members and from student leaders
this solicitation resulted in approximately names being submitted
the provost and selection committee of students then put the names into three categories and
first recommendation and alternates were then provided to the president journal of the international ombudsman association burton who in turn made recommendation to the board of trustees
in their selection criteria the following factors were of foremost importance
an ability to relate to students
experience as classroom teacher and student advisor
ability to say as well as
wide acquaintance with faculty and administration and
good knowledge of the workings of the university
it is also important to note that michigan state university was the only institution to incorporate student opinion in the process for selection at that time
the qualities outlined above have persisted into with the selection of the sixth ombudsperson
in the most recent job posting the following qualifications and knowledge were required conflict resolution skills university policies procedures and regulations teaching and advising at graduate and undergraduate levels academic governance communication skills necessary to relate to diverse community of students faculty and staff university resources and unit administration
while some of the language describing the un ombudsperson had changed and those who can qualify for the position has expanded the description of the role remains relatively unaffected
as stated in the current student rights and responsibilities the president shall appoint sen io faculty member executive manager or other qualified person with the title of university ombudsperson
the ombudsperson shall respect the sensitive and confidential nature of the position and the privacy of all persons soliciting assistance from the off ice of the ombudsperson thereby protecting them against retaliation
the functions shall include the following charges
the ombudsperson shall establish simple orderly procedures for receiving requests complaints and grievances from stu dents
the ombudsperson shall assist students in accomplishing the expeditious settlement of their problems and may advise student that the request complaint or grievance lacks merit or that the student should seek remedy elsewhere in the university
the ombudsperson may also assist the student in obtaining an informal settlement of the problem
the ombudsperson shall have broad investigatory powers and direct and ready access to all university officials including the president
when necessary the ombudsperson shall report directly to the president valid complaints for which no remedy has been found
the ombudsperson shall also report any recommendations regarding such complaints
the ombudsperson shall make periodic reports to he president regarding the operation of the office of the ombudsperson
some of the language related to has been lost over the past fifty years
however for those in the role the centering of integrity academic ability and commitment to justice and equity serves as the foundation for the work of an om buds
experience education and training journal of the international ombudsman association burton indeed per the report of the faculty committee on student affairs an individual with was chosen for the role as first univ ers it ombudsman
faculty member hailing from the department of english rust stepped into the role of university ombudsman after having served as assistant dean in the college of arts and letters rust
in naming rust to the office president tat ed ombudsman will be charged with responsibilities uncommon in american universities or indeed in universities
as rust had no direct experience as an om buds he relied heavily on his understanding of the university structure through his experiences at michigan state university
rust came to michigan state university in as an assistant professor in the department of english
prior to this time he had served as an instructor at grin nell college for two years after earning his at yale in english where his dissertation titled periodical was published broom field mitchell
rust also had ba and an ma from indiana university blooming ton where he also work ed as gray
during the twenty years prior to becoming the om buds rust had held the following roles instructor department of english university of missouri instructor department of english indiana university instructor assistant professor of english grin nell college assistant professor department of english michigan state university associate professor department of english michigan state university acting head of the department of english april through august april professor and assistant dean of the college of arts and letters effective august july where he served until becoming om buds on september september rust also was member of phi beta kappa the modern languages association the american association of university professors and the american federation of teachers
he supplemented his knowledge of the university and the role through reading walter ombudsmen and others citizens protectors in nine countries published in january rust and donald the ombudsmen defender rust
while not defined as such in and rust leaned heavily on independence and neutrality impartiality aspects that are now defined by the international ombudsman association as the standards of practice as concerned with the maki ng of the law but with its administration and enforcement
he must preserve his independence and objectivity and try to see that the law is interpreted and enforced as its makers had originally intended rust
there is also some evidence to su research on george eliot the pen name of mary ann evans may have impacted his desire for the om buds position
for example in the few articles by rust still available today he notes that eliot believed art widened sympathies and that she saw the novel as medium for ethical teaching rust
additionally in his thesis at indiana university and his dissertation at yale university he highlighted sentiments that stood out to him in work as reviewer
rust notes the fact hat eliot was fair over generous loved truth was interested in ethical problems and individual rights and had sympathy for human beings rust
he notes on her fairness in comparison then with other reviewers of the time miss evans was lou sly fair undogmatic and more perceptive than most
she could be sarcastic and blunt but her irony was exercised upon people and books worthy of being expunged
no one would dare defend the victims of her and others who felt her wrath would have utterly disappeared had she not preserved them in insects like amber
journal of the international ombudsman association burton on generosity rust stated own efforts to be fair sometimes cause her to be over generous but her contempt for stupidity insincerity and vanity never weakens
on truth he further noted they reveal that one of her strongest elements of her nature was her love of this same respect for the truth is also evident in her belief in realism as literary creed
the novelist and the poet should ob se mankind carefully and report faithfully and humbly all varieties of experience and all the manifestations of nature thus they will be revealing the truth
on ethical problems revealed also is the fact that george interest in ethical problems was of long standing
she believed that this is an ethical world and that literature and art should concern themselves with matters of morals even books of travel should not teach but disclose ethical lessons
on individual rights miss evans was also in the mainstream of nineteenth century thought in her attitude toward the rights and liberties of the this belief in the sanctity of the individual was the foundation of george political and social it als entered into her support of feminist ideals and her views concerning the need for wider and more thorough education
finally on sympathy for human beings one other significant attribute of george eliot is observable in these writings of mary evans her all embracing sympathy for human they lie deep in the personality of the writer in her emotional nature and the experiences of her life
she had suffered much and had learned the hard lesson that all men suffer alike
ad di ti on ally rust also noted her unique placement in history as writer at time when women were discouraged from intellectual work and having been from poor standing representing class often without voice
this comes through in his descriptions of the om buds as the of the
in some ways it seems he saw the role as medium for ethical teaching and voice as well was interested in trying to help students solve some of their problems but also because the idea of ombudsman as means to that end was most intriguing one rust
one of clearest aspects in writings on eliot was his genuine admiration of her she was the type of person to whom almost everybody instinctively tells his bl es
she had remarkable power of sympathy for almost all kinds of peoples and this sympathy is revealed in her literary criticism as desire to do justice to all sides rust
not surprisingly individuals who at the time knew rust the om buds had similar thoughts about his practices in the role
on generosity that is the kind of thing jim would do
he would find relationship with somebody
he would find in way to make things pleasant for everybody
where they ld talk about their issue without being confrontational smith personal communication november
on truth journal of the international ombudsman association burton he really encouraged to listen to both sides
it one sided discussion whenever we had to discuss an issue
to find the facts on both if they are correct facts
so what trying to say he was strong on me the office staff particularly me on being good listener en sley personal communication october
their impressions of handling of ethical pro bl ems jim it was about what was right to do it was never you just blindly accept what students said or what faculty said smith personal communication november
finally on sympathy and empathy well jim was caring person
think the core of his personality
he and he cared about every individual would say that he came in contact and he laughed lot he smiled and he meant it you know
see something about you that he could like no matter who yo were smith personal communication november he from what he said he talked lot
lot of us just behind the scenes underneath working with people and jim was just going to say this again he was very caring
so even he disagreed with you he was never uncivil
he was never confrontational that knew him anyway
and he could always find common thread with people
so if he was trying and taking concern up and out he was great person to do it smith personal communication november it certainly seems rust emulated many of the same characteristics that he noted in george work during his tenure as an om buds
character philosophy and reputation given this influence his history at the organization and his research and person ality on his om buds philosophy rust agreed that the om buds was somewhat determined by the characteristics of the individual practitioner by the character and style of the person holding it and by his conception of his role as well as by the rad it ions and general nature of the particular institution
while his and certainly show in his annual reports his practices as an om buds emerge as central to the ways in which he worked with students and faculty
throughout rust highlights the skills of advocacy listening persuasion and outreach as core components of his philosophy as an om buds
in fact in his first report rust states regard myself as an advocate of the student whose case judge to be valid one
seek explanations of the predicament and attempt to persuade people to help solve or clarify it
review faculty and administrative decisions sugg est alternatives and consult other persons who might have more authority or be more knowledgeable about the particular circumstances
and at the end of his tenure as om buds morris on consider myself an advocate of the student when feel tain that the student has up to that time consider myself an bullish on michigan state
very few people have been able to see how this institution operates as well as have
work with students with the faculty in the ren ch es and with the administrators at all levels
in the report rust states that he listens advises explains refers and reviews
he often expresses surprise at how little students know about the help available to them even after several journal of the international ombudsman association burton years on campus
rust saw listening as core to his work as an om buds be courteous even sympathetic listener is the first of university
he returns to this theme in his final report where he states on whom the student can vent his anger and frustration
in terms of reviewing he saw it as important review the actions of assistant deans in dismissing students while he also reviewed decisions by the registrar concerning refunds or fees
he reaffirms these roles and skills in the second annual report rust and in interviews with reporters the student gets caught in the university machinery it is the job to pluck him out before he is torn limb from limb moran
further in this second report he highlights that part of the role is to malfunctions in the university machinery and to recommend measures to eliminate them perhaps to the point of extensive overhaul or rebuilding rust
he saw his role in reviewing reports provided by other university offices and reinforce them where needed from the perspective of the om buds and felt that these types of actions and relationships were key to his work
when describing this philosophy he saw himself more con vent ion al than ot he om buds at the time this can be seen as well in his first report in his discussion of student activists am more conservative than some other college and university ombudsmen who conceive their role to be that of leaders of the student revolution or at least to be foremost among those pressing for reform of higher education rust
and again some of my counterparts think their mission is to reform the university
in that respect guess be classified as an arch om bud sm an relieves student pressures and frustrations improves administration and corrects small injustices but he does not put down mass student rebellions morris
this approach to his work was further highlighted as he presented at conferences where he noted he was the lone voice in stating an om buds should serve students in distress and not be leader for transforming the university rust
rust states have said this ombudsman does not regard himself as revolutionary or as one who is out to change human nature
admittedly thus conservative in terms of his role as an om buds he interestingly also describe some offices as having very rigid nd legalistic interpretation of such requirements rust
from statements as this one can certainly sense humanistic approach to his work
this is also seen in his final statements in the report much student hostility and would be prevented or alleviated if all who came in contact with them clerks secretaries cashiers police faculty and administrators would remember that exasperating and obnoxious as they sometimes are they are by all odds the brightest most idealistic most honest generation we have ever had in college
while he was critical of the interactions between certain individuals and students on campus his working relationships with colleagues assisted him in his work
in efforts to solve the problems brought to him rust found it valuable to reach out and connect with other units to build network to which he could refer
this network building included both his personal and professional lives
he was one of the founding members of the uni club membership and in his early years as faculty member lived in the quonset huts smith personal communication november
these emergency war housing facilities were constructed on campus in to house the gro wi ng student enrollment numbers
rust and his family were one of the faculty families that joined students in this housing when he initially arrived at the campus smith personal communication november
these deeply journal of the international ombudsman association burton personal interact ions in the university club and in the quonset huts highlighted his focus on community and relationship building
his focus on relationship building comes clearly to the fore one of his early report where in reaching out to housing he noted that the university served as for
he also served as part of the faculty student traffic committee as some of the issues he dealt with revolved around busing and train transport
he reach ed out to student employment and rel at ion to graduate assistant work issues employed the graduate council to get involved
he also worked diligently to connect with ol in health center the dean of students and the department of psychiatry
despite all these efforts rust did not seem himself as when it came to working with faculty and staff would hope that this awareness ld serve to curb some regrettable behavior among small segment of the staff and faculty
on the other hand the ombudsman has absolutely no desire to be thought of as always looking over the shoulder of his colleagues
two of my faculty as one department chairman have spoken with some heat about the danger which they regarded not as possible but as present
he further noted this point in after having been in office for several years it has always seemed to me that he principal authority of the office was the knowledge of the faculty and the administrative officers of the university that the ombudsman understood something of their problems and was not trying to them
he seeks rather to prevent mistakes or help correct them when they inevitably occur than to embarrass for example by exposure in the state news though he has occasionally been tempted rust
rust also found that the majority of faculty were well rounded in their profession va st majority of the teachers at are not only well trained in their disciplines but are sensible considerate and responsible in evaluating the work of their students
they take their teaching seriously rust
despite this he also found tha there did exist issues within the faculty culture he is very much of the opinion that few but too many faculty members use grades punitively though he could not prove this in court of law
the behavior of few instructors towards students is in excusably rude
one has the feeling that they are taking out their aggressions on the students rust
additionally are too many who have allowed themselves to go to seed not keeping up with the latest developments in their fields who lecture from yellowed notes who escape from their responsibilities by making use of audio visual aids rust
he felt that many faculty regarded their students as the especially these days of student unrest an enemy ho is taking their time from more important matters rust
he also notes that some faculty regard them as and and treat them as such
in his conversations about students it seems that rust struggled with the shifts of in loco pa rent is to student citizen
in his initial report rust he notes clientele consisting of late adolescents and young adults is peculiarly volatile idealistic impatient and often more than little self righteous and intolerant of restraint particularly those imposed by an older generation
he was grateful that some students did not visit his office tension packed group has almost ignored my office the campus activists
they have not attempted to use my office as means of achieving their goals fact for which am most grateful rust
that said he journal of the international ombudsman association burton also demonstrates his ability to be neutral as he states that students are reasonable whose problems arise from misunderstanding or in su ff ic ie nt information
rust acknowledged that many students learn to live with unresolved problems because they are and do not know where to go rust
he discussed carrying the office into the dorms similar to what the om buds of den mar was doing at the time rust student come to the office or know about its existence am afraid this is true among very large percentage of the student population then perhaps the office should go to the
on he other side he also noted that some students are aware of their rights that they tend to forget their responsibilities rust
in all these interactions rust leaned heavily on publication to define the ways in which he worked
like gell horn rust on cl ud ed that the chief source of power came from the fact that an om buds always state his views on the matter to the person concerned gell horn as sited in rust
in many of his articles discussing the role ust discusses the om buds role as conceptualized in legislative processes
he notes in any case the parliamentary commissioner may always state his views on the matter to the person connected the fact that he has the power to voice his opinion enables him to exercise guiding influence on public servants and provides him with legal basis for negotiating with the agencies concerned anderson
regardless of this confrontational power he believed however that the best way to achieve an equitable outcome was to subtly influence the process behind the scene in quoting the danish ombudsman is more enduringly forceful than
his perception of his power and scope is also noted in his reports
in one case he state two students suspended by the student faculty judiciary accused that body of improper behavior in hearing and deciding their case
an investigation revealed absolutely no grounds for such an accusation
this case established that the ombudsman may re vi ew the procedures not the substantive decisions of that body
the ombudsman does not believe it is his function to serve as court of last appeal nor does the vice president
in his own writings rust also notes that an om buds should have his her charge phrased in general terms so that person appointed would have fairly wide latitude in creating the part to fit his own conceptions of the appointed from among the senior faculty and the position should be one of prestige be outside the regular table of the organization and have investigatory and and ready access to all university
again one finds that these characteristics are inherent in organizational om buds as outlined by the international ombudsman association in their standards of practice and code of ethics the ombudsman office and the ombudsman are independent from other organizational entities
the ombudsman holds no other position within the organization which might compromise independence
the ombudsman exercises sole discretion over whether or how to act regarding an concern trend or concerns of multiple individuals over time
the journal of the international ombudsman association burton ombudsman may also initiate action on on cern identified through the direct observation
the ombudsman has access to all information and all individuals in the organization as permitted by law
the uds man is designated neutral reporting to the highest possible level of the organization and operating independent of ordinary line and staff structures
the ombudsman should not report to nor be structurally affiliated with any compliance function of the organization
the ombudsman serves in no additional role within the organization which would compromise the neutrality
the ombudsman should not be aligned with any formal or informal associations within the organization in way that mig ht create actual or perceived conflicts of interest for the ombudsman
the ombudsman should have no personal interest or stake in and incur no gain or loss from the outcome of an issue
the ombudsman has responsibility to consider the legitimate oncer ns and interests of all individuals affected by the matter under consideration
the ombudsman helps develop range of responsible options to resolve problems and facilitate discussion to identify the best options
the ombudsman endeavors to be worthy of the trust placed in the ombudsman office
rust also defended the role of the om buds
in letter to the editor in he responded to the criticism of student it is not the function of the ombudsman either to enact rules or to encourage students to violate them
on the contrary this office attempts to see that rules and regulations are administered and enforced as uniformly and fairly as another function of the ombudsman is to recommend changes in regulations or procedures they seem in his judgement to be causing problems to significant numbers of students or to be gravely unjust to even few students
while many of the expectations and qualifications for an om buds established during era are still encapsulated by current standards own character and style certainly helped him to define the role of the om buds for michigan state university and successors
clearly not only his charge made him an but also the breadth of his experiences as fac member and an administrator his research into the history of the role in other regions his own research as an academic related to moral philosophy and psychology through works the conversations maintained with other om buds offices as they ere established including the overall campus climate and history of the university itself
student concerns the focus for om buds role as defined in his own character and style at michigan state university would appear to be student related con ce
rust stated that students often come to the om buds as they do not know where to go and need advice
rust noted that hey ask about everything from legal questions to where they can get information about vocations and professions rust
the issues in the first year included the breaking of leases false arrests divorce and even income tax
in all these cases he made it clear that he did not provide legal advice and referred them to the associated students of michigan state legal services
he also notes some of the more humorous stories which included dealing with encyclopedia sales and magazines rock bands car garages and filling station concerns even complaint regarding early enrollment beginning on the first day of de er season rust
he states that these issues really highlighted that students needed to learn what they could and could not go to the om buds office for
concerns that rust worked with exclusively included the changing of majors journal of the international ombudsman association burton entrance to law school issues with public safety and more
in an article from november in the phi delta kappa rust stated after having only been in the role for little over two months so most of the troubles students bring to me are real
even though they may have contributed to or even caused their difficulty by their youthful impatience by inexperience and immaturity disguised as idealism their troubles are real
as commented earlier characteristically they want complete freedom but want to be pro tec ted from the results of their exercise of that freedom
and though we may indeed we do become impatient censorious even angry with them we still must help them
we must educate them not only by our performance in the classroom but also by our ex amp les as scholars and gentlemen
he often found that graduate students were treated inequitably opportunities for exploitation of graduate assistants are so great that department chairmen and deans should be constantly on the lookout for any evidence that this is occurring rust
however the areas of greatest concern for him seemed to be those centering on matters of instruction partiality in class giving impossible examinations providing inadequate information about such things as class attendance rust
for him he most troubling among these was the matter of grades
the ombudsman still at heart professor he has been teacher for years an ombudsman for two sincerely believes that no one but the teacher can give grades and no one but he can change them
he also believes however that the instructor should be willing and able to explain and if requested by proper authority to justify any grade he gives rust
furthermore it has always seemed to this observer that student has right to inspect his final exam and to have this instructor explain to him what was right or wrong about it and what effect it had upon his term grade rust
these concerns related to instruction would later result in the creation of the code of teaching responsibility code that outlines the minimum expectations for faculty interactions with students and that is used in the consideration for sal ary increases promotion and tenure
rust also continued to be concerned about fees tuition and incivility as it related to the access of administrators
in the report brooks notes use this code almost without exception in the resolution of pr obl ems of instruction
during the academic year shift in the problems brought to the office seemed to occur
rust noted that the complaints seemed to be more difficult and require more meetings with more people and additional tact and di pl om acy rust
later in he also notes that visitor numbers had dropped significantly from to
he attributed this to off of the ending of large scale american involvement in vietnam the cessation of draft calls and the increased difficulty of finding jobs have all acted to reduce unrest and tension and to increase motivation for the books
and in turn they account in part for the decreased traffic through this further and less mod est ly believe that the ombudsman has influenced many offices on campus to improve their procedures and to treat students with more courtesy and consideration
this sentiment was however short lived as in the following year the complaint numbers surge again
this rust attributed to the pressures on students to make high grades so that they are now evermore protesting when they do not
journal of the international ombudsman association burton as problems mounted rust found it important to document his efforts through classification system for complaints
even early on he noted the differences between academic and non academic issues
he felt that these classifications were not always as tidy as they could be and sometimes bled over into one another
however it assisted him in explaining his work
rust often reflected on his own practice from my own vantage point can report that approximately of the students who have come to see me or students seem to be satisfied with the treatment they received with the solutions suggested or with the explanation either as to why they have no valid grounds for complaint or why nothing could be done to alter the situation rust
as in current practices where om buds provide upward feedback to administrators rust followed similar approach
in his first report he urged believe that it would be good thing both for the sinners and saints among the university community to reread carefully and to discuss thoughtfully chapter iv of the report of the committee on undergraduate ed uca ti on
this he recommend ed in his belief that each department needed to have committee on teaching to improve teaching practices within the institution
additionally he urged the creation of committee on professional conduct for the university
he stated he only means of discipline existing is for the department chairman and dean to deny inept teachers and those how behave in an unprofessional manner in the classroom salary and promotion rust
while there did exist tenure com mi he wanted faculty and staff to be held more accountable for their behavior in the classroom
in connection with this he felt that students had the right to know what was going to happen in the classroom
another area that rust worked to impact was the registration and admission processes
in his first report he urged the faculty to approve recommendations made by the assistant dean group dean group has worked out uniform procedure for implementing the long standing policy con ce rn ing late drops not all faculty members agree either with the policy or the procedure and many insist on acting independently
rust also moved forward with recommendation to the educational policies committee as result of my observations and experiences as ombudsman in this area of student faculty relations have requested the educational policies committee to student the possibility of preparing set of recommendations which would be most useful to new faculty members especially conc er ni ng what is expected of rust he further recommended that these expectations be published in faculty facts and handbook for students
these suggestions later became what is now called the code of teaching responsibility still in use in at michigan state university
his one hope that has not materialized yet was that this code could be incorporated in the academic freedom report if that document is reviewed and
given his concerns over fees and tuition rust met with president the possibility of the university shifting from its present block structure to plan in which the student would pay flat rate per credit hour rust
this later went to board of trustee committee where it was recommended that the university shift to this model
while rust seldom mentions the presidents he worked with and in what capacity he may have communicated with them he did serve during the tenure of three such university heads john walter adams and clift on whart on jr
the descriptions of their tenure from the michigan state university web site further highlight the environmental context in which he operated as an om buds and that influenced his ra ct ices
time at michigan state university was characterized by tremendous growth in enrollments jumping from to over students
is described as journal of the international ombudsman association burton very concerned with both the faculty and the students at the university
in the late he began the spartan roundtable which provided students forum in which to present their concerns directly to the president
he oversaw the reorganization of the faculty governance structure as well as the creation of the and freed oms of
ms uc adams had made it clear he was in the role only on an interim basis which made way for whart on
time is described as often turbulent one featuring student demonstrations in and as well as national collegiate athletic association investigation of the football program
fiscal problems resulting from budget cuts remained constant problem throughout tenure
his major achievements were his successful efforts to maintain the quality of ms academic programs despite budget reductions his commitment to the education of the economically and educationally disadvantaged and the integration of the school of osteopathic medicine with the other medical schools ms uc
despite the im mens growth of the university and the times under these presidents rust stated have been responsible to the at most universities the ombudsman is appointed by and responsible to the president of the school stein
the pre si dents and other administrators did not try to impact work once has anyone from above interfered with one of my investigations or even suggested that do something in one way or another morris on
in discussing his authority on ca mp us colleagues even stated smith personal communication november but guy who had been an assistant dean in arts and letters which has never been powerhouse college on campus
all of sudden the president invests lot of power in him
and have no doubt that if somebody squawked the president just hit them over the head in very diplomatic way
and it would have only taken once
from these observations position as om buds allowed him to operate in ways that best addressed how students were treated by the administration on campus and provide the systemic feedback as outlined in the academic freedom for students at michigan state university report
in later years tuition and al aid continued to be areas of concern which he often expressed to the president and to the vice president for student affairs
additionally the drop and add policy was developed because of an om buds recommendation at this time rust
not only did his upward feedback improvements that could be made on campus but it also discussed academic units and offices the when it came to their work with students
finally rust handled upward feedback head on and in the moment rather than wait in until the annual report to provide his comments to the president
whether it was an individual appointment with student or providing upward feedback to the president or another administrator rust managed wide range of concerns thro ug ho ut his time in the om buds role
throughout the core of his work remained the ensuring that students were treated fairly not only by the faculty and administrators but by the office and its staff
here his noting of the caseload and available resources and his advocating for more support when needed helped address and maintain the reputation and services of the office
caseload staffing and support according to university records initial salary as university ombudsman was today adjusting for inflation up from today adjusting for inflation on month basis
this increase in salary acknowledged that moving to the om buds position was promotion
the operating budget for his office outside of his sa was journal of the international ombudsman association burton which included amounts for labor supplies and services equipment even additional salaries for support staff september
funding for the position came from the general account through the budget
the office ng time was initially located in room of mor rill hall where he had kept his office as faculty member in english
later the office moved to room in lint on hall or per its nickname the administration
providing an office outside of the department of english for rust it remained in lint on hall until third om buds moved it to north hall in order to provide space for visitors outside of areas suggesting the office was part of the admin is tra ti on
ms helen gr oh was the full time secretary
in tenure he reports caseloads ranging from to students from to
while no standard number exists for the appropriate caseload for an om buds it seems that increased use an the need for upward feedback support and staffing were also concern for rust
during the academic year the number of visitors to the office increased to an extent that impacted the way in which rust was able to perform his work would not think that an increase of approximately in his business would have made all that much difference but it stretched the energy and resourcefulness of the ombudsman to the limit rust
as result of this case upsurge he successfully app ea led for assistance for both the and academic years
rust stated was not possible for the ombudsman to spend as much time in the investigation of the cases which were brought to him
oftentimes he had an uncomfortable feeling that the investigation was
the university appointed dr theodore brooks on half time basis as associate ombudsman to assist rust with his work
brooks had served as the assistant dean of research development and graduate studies for the school of advanced graduate studies as well as an assistant professor in the school of social work
brooks began at michigan state university in after earning degrees from calvin college ab university of michigan and michigan state university
he stated that his goal was to reach and fringe groups
in the following year the office also added donald en sley graduate student in community health with degree in social biology and minor in environmental health ta bb as assistant to the ombudsman to specifically assist minority students
he had previously worked with the office of equal opportunity at north carolina central university and began at michigan state university march of twitch ell
in an article in the faculty news on september the following is noted en sley prefers to call himself the
he said that having black ombudsman will make black and minority students more comfortable about seeking aid through the office
rust agrees that the addition of black ombudsman is important because know number of black students come to me because white
after en sley left the offic in peter dual took over to assist in working with minority students during
dual was doctoral student in the educational administration
prior to michigan state university he had earned degree from western michigan university sociology with minors in social work and elementary education and had went on to also achieve degree there
he had served as career counselor for the neighborhood youth corporation and while occupied in the office of the university om buds ma for hours week he also worked in the supportive services center
he would later become the dean of the college of health and human services and professor of public health at san diego state university and provost of hah ne mann un ive jet magazine
the addition of brooks en sley and dual to the office allowed more time spent on investigations and working with students to find resolution to their concerns
rust noted of the enlarged staff each student could and did receive more attention and his grievance was journal of the international ombudsman association burton more thoroughly investigated and believe more successfully treated than in previous years rust
brooks authored the report in as rust was on sabbatical leave from june ough september january
representing the office brooks discussed the ways in which they were able to expand their interactions with the broader university community and address student concerns more diligently as result wid er university participation by staff eg rust with academic council brooks with student affairs committee etc
more campus visibility of staff participation in dorm training programs visits to departments eg more intensive follow up on roble ms broadened variety of approaches to students and their complaints brooks
these comments clearly show that having more than one individual working in the office benefitted the types and amount of services it provided as members of the office were able to participate in other spaces of the university
brooks noted fuller participation by the ombudsman staff in growing number of vital areas of the university community and in more meaningful responses to student needs brooks
brooks left the office in and no replacement of an associate ombudsman was made at that time
en sley left to pursue an instructor position in the michigan state university college of osteopathic medicine and as of the date of this public at ion is professor emeriti in the division of health sciences at east carolina university ta bb
instead the office shifted to utilizing graduate students until when it again appointed an assistant ombudsperson but this was outside the term role in the office
despite his limited staff rust noted yet another area of support that in his opinion would be of great use to the office the ombudsman often wishes that he could consult lawyer himself
mr carr the attorney for the bo of trustees is most often unavailable and it would be matter of great convenience both to the ombudsman and to the students whom he represents if he could have access to lawyer when he needs to
he wishes that his budget could include retainer fee for legal counsel rust
however plausible this recommendation the office of the university ombudsperson still does not have its own external counsel to that of the university despite its role as an office
with that being noted during tenure as om buds it appears as though the return on investment in the office was well received and has been ever since as the presence of an om buds on campus has never been suspended since
in fact the office has expanded in terms of staff in recent years and is continuing to examine its recruitment support and resources in continuous effort to better address the concerns of the student population
legacy and conclusion being one of the first om buds in the united state made rust resource for other colleges and universities as they explored options for the creation of their own om buds programs
during the second year of the office rust already received inquiries from institutions ranging from princeton nd rut gers in the east to uc la oregon and gon za ga in the
he also cites wayne state university university of illinois southern arkansas aquinas college southwest missouri and pontiac state hospital as being some of the first institutions to rea ch out to him rust with the university of cincinnati and the state of michigan following the trend bit later rust
aside from these individual rust participated in nationwide workshops and presentations about the ro le journal of the international ombudsman association burton the ombudsman was participant in workshops concerning role of the ombudsman in higher the first at detroit in october the second at san francisco in may
at the detroit meeting he was an almost lonely voice expressing the view that the chief function is to serve individual students in distress not to be leader of campus drives for transforming the university rust
additionally he took part in seminar by the higher education executive associates in chicago rust while also presenting to local groups like the lansing civitan club and campus organizations like the residence hall program rust
rust discussed his participation in the discussions by the carnegie commission on higher educ at ion in on the campus decision making process carnegie commission probably sees us as close to what is going on and will expect us to give an insight into what students think their role in decision making is
furthermore he was re quested to serve as consultant on ad hoc committees within the university based on his unique perspective
impact on the field of om buds work was so wide ranging during his tenure that his experience and unique approach to the role are still ref le ct ed in the practices of many om buds offices today
given the campus climate and student issues of the time he shared the following reflections at the outset and at the end of his career as an om buds that certainly resonate today were it not for the fac that the laws brought by moses from the mount of sin ai were so largely ignored could wish that some present day moses would promulgate new eleventh commandment shalt be kind one to rust
that is to reaffirm my faith our students regardless of how annoying they can be regardless of how impatient often feel with their maturity with their quick anger and their equally quick imputation of dishonorable motives to honorable men
they are still the brightest and best we have and believe do better job of running things when they get into positions of power than we have done rust
testament to his personality rust appeared to have managed the role with little complaint
in an interview in it was noted he hopes eventually get on top of the to begin teaching again
but for now rust said usually exhausted after with the intensity of student and wants nothing more than to go home to quiet evening wi th his wife
that said the role was never expected to be an easy one neither by rust nor the university
news article from march of mentions some foreseeable difficulties and provost neville fears that the nature of the role could alienate an ombudsman from his colleagues
may drift out of the mainstream of programs of the department and because he is not doing the same thing as his colleagues
there is also the fear that one ombudsman or three om buds me is not enough to do the job
rust retired from the role of university ombudsman on september but retired only from the university on september after going on what was described as now defined as consulting year su january
reflected on his time in the office in his final report it is with mixed feelings that leave this office
look forward to freedom from the alarm blare and to the leisure to read and engage in my several ho bb ie but shall also miss the contact with the many talented learned and humane people with whom have worked
can only wish my successor well and stand ready to give him her the benefit of what have learned as ombudsman
journal of the international ombudsman association burton rust passed away on august at the age of
dr carolyn st ie ber michigan state second university ombudsman noted this in her annual report for that year
she was his immediate successor to the role being appointed effective november october following two month interim om buds dr frederic founder and first dean of the lym an briggs college who was assisted by carl berg graduate student in educational administration
legacy still carries on both in the depart me nt of english through an endowed scholarship in his name and in the history of the office of the university ombudsperson at michigan state university
while the current staff of the office never had the opportunity to meet him his words and the way he co ns tr uc ted the office and role strongly impact the daily operations
in fact many of the practices in relation to fairness individual rights and the way in which the office listens to visitors have remained nearly unchanged
in the words of his close end my mind jim quietly started an administrative revolution on campus that continued on for many years smith personal communications october
and ironically for someone who insisted that this ombudsman does not regard himself as re volution ary rust it is exactly his administrative revolution of fairness and kindness that has expanded to institutions of higher education across the united states
in reflecting on the history and legacy of james rust one wonders how th ese themes present themselves in the work of om buds
also whether examining this history can be beneficial to the field in the present day context and climate
in fact om buds and institutions are grappling with questions related to whet he an om buds office should be established or retained who should hold these roles and what their training should be how to place value on an approach to the work and the building of relationships to do the work the different concerns being forth and how an om buds should address them and how many om buds there should be within an organization and what an appropriate caseload should look like
this research does not propose answers to these detailed questions
it does however show the in ce pt ion of the role in higher education in the united states and offers clear marker for comparison with the work today
it also offers the field means to examine how the personal and professional experiences of an om buds shape the role and how the role ultimately shapes them
finally this research lends us the opportunity to interpret and learn from the experiences of the unique personalities that came before
perhaps now with of still raging at times an om buds role should be more than ever to help those afloat reach safe waters

keyword om buds ombudsman organization development stewardship organizational reform patriarchy hierarchy collaboration power servant leadership journal of the international ombudsman association moore introduction the dalai lama said realization of own potential and self confidence in ability one can build better
in his book stewardship choosing service over self interest nd ed
peter block describes the radical organizational ef or ms he believes are necessary to create better organizations communities and better world
he envisions organizations which upend the traditional hierarchy and are built upon equality and employee partnership to unleash employee potential and owner ship

summary of argument block recommends widespread reform within the organization based on key decision points which are interconnected and even co dependent with other variables
block implies the comp on en ts of his concept are important and interrelated so this does not appear to be concept from which an organization can pick and choose options
block begins by removing excess layers of management to allow the best decisions to be made and implemented at the lowest level
block advocates ending many traditional perks and rewards he views as perpetuating the traditional or parental hierarchy and makes employees dependent upon managers
block turns employees into partners with ownership and decision making power which he terms as choosing over
he sees equality as part of partnership which means managers need to give up traditional perks and privileges and employees need to be rewarded as team based on real outcomes

arbitration financial ombudsman service consumer disputes journal of the international ombudsman association sh ar ma introduction mandatory arbitration is facing backlash in the united states of america us
several proposed legis lat ions loom large on the fate of pre dispute mandatory arbitration in the us that can void all pre dispute mandatory arbitration agreement in consumer employment antitrust and civil rights disputes
this is not the first time that mandatory arbitration has come under attack
often perceived as being preferred by businesses and law firms mandatory arbitration has been under serious scrutiny for over ec ade
in this backdrop this article proposes the idea of introducing financial ombudsman service like scheme to resolve consumer disputes in the us as an alternative to pre dispute mandatory arbitration
the is an innovative multi tier dis pu te resolution system that employs mediation recommended settlement and adjudication to resolve disputes
its unique position in relation to consumers industry and the legislature enables it to transcend the old generation traditional idea of ombudsman as grievance address al point to new generation participative agent in reforming laws in this case laws affecting consumers
this article first provides brief background and contextual is es the proposal by exploring whether mandatory arbitration is suitable means of resolving consumer disputes
the second part explores the concept of ombudsman and differentiates it from the traditional and organisation al ombudsman schemes
the third part explores the internal mechanics and external syne of the
the fourth part compares mandatory arbitration with the and discusses why an like system works better than mandatory arbitration particularly in resolving consumer disputes
the fifth part discusses the feasibility of such sc he me in the us followed by the conclusion
mandatory arbitration and consumer disputes after the great depression in and the second world war the us emerged as market leader leaving behind many countries to follow its foot trail
as an unmatched leader openly and proudly supporting free trade and capitalism it gave to the people of the world the
trade and commerce progress in tandem with legal system that facilitates trade and effective resolution of commercial disputes
in ad dition to business friendly laws us encouraged the growth of commerce by creating congenial atmosphere for resolution of commercial disputes by enacting the new york arbitration act and the united states arbitration act renamed as the fed eral arbitration act in
the was supported by business community which viewed litigation as expensive slow and ill suited to the growing needs of commerce

the unintended effects of pre dispute mandatory arbitrations however began to be and arbitration came to be viewed as means of circumventing mandatory rules and as an instrument of oppression
more particularly mandatory arbitration came under serious scrutiny when the journal of the international ombudsman association sh ar ma attorney general of minnesota filed lawsuit against the nat ion al arbitration forum naf alleging bias fraud unfair consumer practices in arbitrations administered by naf
professor elizabeth bar tho let former naf arbitrator was removed from being the arbitrator in various pending cases after she delivered an ward against company
in her deposition against naf she complained of of naf in favour of big companies
naf quickly reached settlement with the attorney office to immediately stop administering consumer arbitrations bud ni
following the naf imbroglio pre dispute mandatory arbitration came to be regularly attacked by consumer rights groups
consumer disputes in the us are currently resolved in various ways mediation and arbitration being the most commonly used mechanisms
consumers can seek help from local consumer agencies better business bureaus for guidance in choosing the right forum for their grievance redressal
furthermore state attorney offices has consumer protection division which deals with consumer grievances
they file cases against firms for fraud and unfair market practices
however these divisions cannot force businesses to come forward for negotiations mediations or arbitrations or act as private attorneys for an aggrieved consumer
instead they act as watchdogs for con sum er rights abuse
pre dispute mandatory arbitration has been controversial
it gives rise to serious issues of consent and unfairness dill on coff man since consumers sometimes unknowingly sign contracts containing such clauses it hout having any meaningful say in selecting the forum schmitz thereby giving up their right to access courts and jury trial
mandatory arbitration therefore suffers from gaping holes in terms of procedural fairness such as in the mode of selecting arbitrators institutions and rules
critics of mandatory arbitration point out that the system is biased in favor of businesses as they can repeatedly appoint pro business arbitrators who tend to favor businesses over on sum ers
critics further point out that the system lacks transparency accountability and undermines the development of public law
in an attempt was made to introduce an arbitration fairness act and ever since then with legis lat ions introduced in the years been an ongoing attempt to introduce measures to restrict mandatory arbitration and promote fairness in dispute resolution between consumers and businesses
several legis lat ions have been introduced to do away with pre dispute arbitration provisions in consumer contracts but without much success
some of these proposed legis lat ions namely restoring statutory rights and interests of the states act of mandatory arbitration transparency act of arbitration fairness act of forced arbitration injustice repeal act arbitration fairness for consumers act mandatory arbitration transparency act of investor choice act of can significantly affect the future of mandatory arb it ration in the us
this period of scepticism towards mandatory arbitration presents an opportunity to experiment with other mechanisms of dispute resolution such as hybrid ombudsman scheme
considering the uncertainties associated with the future of man da tory arbitration there is merit in exploring other mechanisms of dispute resolution that can counterbalance the problems posed by mandatory arbitration without necessarily burdening the courts with more disputes
consumers are also likely to support an ombudsman scheme which is generally regarded as much more consumer friendly than mandatory arbitration
this article proposes the idea of an like scheme for resolving consumer disputes
ombudsman classical organisational hybrid historically the institution of ombudsman emerged in sweden the just it ie ombudsman and gradually spread across to other scandinavian countries during early nineteenth and twentieth centuries doyle
in finland became the second country to adopt the ct ice followed by denmark in norway gell horn and new zealand in
journal of the international ombudsman association sh ar ma the earliest use of the term and its establishment is attributed to the swedish parliament in that intended to provide means by which citizens could pursue anc es against the administrative and executive branches of the government ro we gad lin
in due course many other countries adopted the practice to effectively remove friction between the government and its citizenry
over period of time the traditional idea of ombudsman has evolved into different forms
the classical ombudsman as one removing friction between the government and its citizenry paved the way for organisational ombudsman as one resolving disputes between an individual and private public organisation st ie ber
in the traditional sense the ombudsman was the representative of the people who bridged the gap between the ruler and the ruled
he was responsible for removing friction between state officials and the common cit since the state exercised substantial power over the lives of its citizens raw lings and generally enjoyed security of tenure
organisational om bud sm en on the other hand are engaged by organ is at ions and corporations to resolve day to day differences
organisational ombudsman is professional manager within an organisation who is committed to the organisation he or she serves yet his her loyalty is subservient to the principles of fairness and impartiality ro we gad lin
om pared to the role of classical ombudsman the organisational ombudsman model is quite restrictive in its scope brandon et al
foe gen melt zer kaha na
they serve as platform to express concerns and resolve disputes that arise within particular organisation and thus act as an alternate and informal channel of communication generally without much capacity to hold formal investigations adjudicate or arbitrate disputes
organisational ombudsmen have much less protection and ca be vulnerable to budget considerations and associated trappings of corporate culture
but despite these structural differences ombudsman in both forms aim to humanise administration support fairness accountability and equity and provide chance for ordinary people those without power or privilege to be heard and to get fair treatment st ie ber
in the course of its evolutionary journey in addition to the above mentioned classical and organisational ombudsman the institution of ombudsman as also developed into hybrid forms
unlike classical or organisational ombudsmen schemes hybrid ombudsman may be set up by the parliament but can be funded by private parties
some hybrid private sector ombudsman schemes can resolve disputes between two private parties
the is remarkable hybrid ombudsman scheme which is an independent expert in settling complaints between consumer and businesses providing financial services
though set up by the parliament as an independent public body the is company limited by guarantee not having share capital called the financial ombudsman service limited and it is funded by levies and fees paid by businesses
whereas classical and organisation ombudsman act as grievance redressal point their pote to bring about changes within the system is limited
the on the other hand can significantly affect the larger system in which it operates
the financial ombudsman scheme in the is essentially dispute resolution system between consumers and businesses in the financial market
it has been set up as an independent public body by the parliament to deal with complaints and resolve them in fair and impartial way
despite be ing set up as public body the origin of dates back to when four insurers formed the insurance ombudsman bureau to handle consumer grievances against themselves samuel
with other insurers joining the ibo holding expanded and in the government fused the with other consumer financial ombudsman organ is at ions to form the
journal of the international ombudsman association sh ar ma internally the processes complaints in different stages
the complainant can make complaint by telephone or by filling up an online form or by making complaint by post
the internal complaint depending on how it is received goes through the call centre routing of complaints the adjudicator conciliation and the ombudsman review
at the first instance complaints are to be directed to the firm against whom the private consumer has grievances which then responds to the customer
such responses should sufficiently address the subject matter of the complaint and if complaint is legitimate the firm must take appropriate remedial action mac neil
the firm then informs the customer about any remedial action taken and provides him the information about the ombudsman service available
if the customer is not satisfied with this response he can contact the call centre of the which routes the complaint to the adjudicator
the adjudicator investigates the case by collecting and examining relevant documents in an inquisitorial way and then attempt to settle the dispute between the customer and the firm by way of guided on ciliation mediation
the adjudicator considers relevant laws regulations and codes of practice and tries to conciliate in an informal setting giving each party various concessions to mutually settle the matter
the internal complaint system call cen tr and guided conciliation mediation by the adjudicator helps in checking trivial complaints and bulk of them are either settled or withdrawn
if the parties are still not satisfied they can to the ombudsman who reviews and renders formal sion at this stage
externally the shares wide network of relationships with other actors ie customers industry regulators and courts
in relation to the disputing parties customers and firms the service is provided free of cost to the customers
the decision rendered by the ombudsman is not binding on the customer and he is free to pursue other legal remedies
in relation to the regulator the financial services authority both and have rule making responsibilities un der the financial services and markets act of but the is free on consumer grievance redressal aspects
the maintains strong hold over policy matters ie approve its annual budget set limits of monetary jurisdiction of the setting les governing its compulsory jurisdiction etc
the on its part can give feedback on the general functioning of the industry and share data for formulating policy decisions and guidelines relating to consumer grievance red res sal system
this connection with regulatory agency opens up avenues for constructive communications and it can liaise with regulators to construct new rules mer ricks and bring about changes in the industry
in relation to courts is separate rom the court system and keeps disputes out of the court system but unlike decisions wherein orders are binding on both parties here decisions are binding only on the firm
it therefore stands in unique nodal position in relation the consumers the industry and the regulators mer ricks
the incorporates elements of negotiation conciliation mediation adjudication reaping the benefits of all the ad rs thereby making it very effective consistent means for dispute resolution
the network shared by the with external actors differentiates it from other forms of dispute resolution and highlights why it has the potential to do better than the other ad rs functioning independently
the synergies generated by the distinctive position also makes it unique organisation and places it in an arrangement through which it can effectively serve the customers and the industry by resolving their disputes the regulators law makers by providing them guidelines for making ew policies the courts by keeping litigations away from their purview
the therefore shows promising potential for resolving general consumer disputes even beyond the financial market
journal of the international ombudsman association sh ar ma industry figure internal process and external synergy mandatory arbitration vis the for consumer dispute resolution integrates multi tier dispute resolution structure internally and enjoys unique nodal position relative to other actors that makes it very effective system
particularly when compared to mandatory arbitration an like system is likely to be far more advantage and especially apropos for general consumer disputes resolution for the following reasons
first unlike mandatory arbitrations wherein one off disputes are arbitrated award rendered and forgotten an like system provides an opportunity to oversee and examine unrelated disputes for the purpose of arriving at meaningful policy formulations
this helps in determining changes and trends in consumer attitudes raw lings
these trends can then be communicated to the regulator who can ta them into account for formulating future rules for the industry mer ricks
unlike arbitration an like system will provide guidance for future regulation based on the experiences of previous cases
in the words of walter gell horn under an like system instance would have generative force beyond the episode gell horn
this generative force can also help in avoiding similar problems from recurring
second an like system counters the problem of opacity of keeping mistakes shortcomings of the companies out of public view
for example nursing home admission contracts which provide for arbitration keep the helplessness of suffering patients of those institutions within the confines of the arbitration table
any maladministration in such institutions is susceptible to going unnoticed
an like system can help to bring such issues to fore thereby fostering transparency and accountability tri pp
third an like system serves as watchdog for the industry
the arbitration industry as such does not have any inbuilt mechanism to receive feedback on its own functioning
an like regulator ombudsman review guided conciliation call centre courts consumer firm journal of the international ombudsman association sh ar ma system overcomes this limitation
for example in the field of con sum er arbitration when the naf was accused of defrauding customers wells there was no system in place to take into account such in cid enc es
though other arbitration institutes such as the aaa at that time voluntarily suspended its con sum er debt arbitration arbitrators and arbitration institutions remained immune from civil claims
though some commentators have recommended diluting arbitral immunity there was hardly any response from the arbitration industry except for adopting code ethics which are completely dependent on voluntary compliance by arbitration providers
the prospect of connivance among arbitrator arbitration provider and company respondent is not present in an like system
the effect of repeat player advantage and repeat payer bias do not arise in the like scheme
though funded by the industry and recognised by regulators the as such is independent from the industry regulators consumers and consumer bodies
fourth ombudsman in an like system in certain circumstances is not bound to strictly follow the law and can give rulings as per their sense of justice
the ombudsman can disregard rigid application of prescribed legal rules if such an approach is necessary to reach fair result by adopting alternative considerations
this safeguards the spirit if not the letter of the law mac neil
it is especially suitable in the field of consumer protection where sometimes of justice do not agree with the rules of raw lings
an ombudsman in an like system can go beyond submissions and pleadings in making his determination
as illustrated in the case of on the application of green den man co financial ombudsman service the court cal ly stated that some contexts it is unfair for decision maker to go beyond the points put forward by the complainant
in litigation before the courts for example the issues are normally defined in the pleadings and the court will not no rm ally decide the case on point that has not been raised in the pleadings although they may be amended to raise an issue suggested by the court if no unfairness results
the present context is very it cannot therefore be contended that the mb uds man acts unfairly if he decides against respondent on the basis of comparison of the rival pension schemes that the complainant did not
therefore such scheme is more consumer friendly and fairer than mandatory arbitration
fifth under like system consumer is not intimidated by his lack of procedural knowledge as is the case with arbitration
third party grievance handling institutions are democratic instrumentalities ad ler which employ expectation management strategies to win over complainants gil ad
it works towards improving the structure of consumer dispute resolution
they try to remove lack of familiarity and procedural obstacles thereby improving consumer access to justice
an like system is simple and makes hiring legal representation by the complainants unnecessary hereby also saving legal costs samuel
sixth an like system does not obstruct the development of law and can impact reformation of the law
arbitration as an alternative to is often criticised for stagnating the development of law by taking disputes outside the purview of court an like system overcomes this problem
an like system does not completely take cases outside the court system since the complain an has the option of going to the court if he does not accept the decision of the ombudsman
furthermore ombudsman train and mentor adjudicators which gives rise to an culture that impacts the decision making heuristics and instincts of individual which results in consistent decisions brings about predictability and improves the dispute resolution system
raw ling and quote the example of the attack made by an ombudsman on the first draft of code of ba practice in raw lings perfect example to highlight the reformatory role played by the like scheme
journal of the international ombudsman association sh ar ma seventh one of the arguments against arbitration is that it is private adjudication of disputes and that arbitrators and heir awards are relatively free from public scrutiny
an like system easily overcomes such problem
awards can be placed for review in courts and are appealable by consumers unlike that of an arbitrator whose awards are final and binding
moreover decisions unlike most arbitration awards can be published
eighth one of the key advantages of such system is its multi tier internal procedure that reduces the burden on courts
these internal stages help fil ter out avoidable disputes
the decisions of the ombudsman are binding on the complainants only if they accept it leaving them with the option of litigation
but in practice few complainants do so samuel
consumers do not resort to litigation sin ce adverse rulings by ombudsmen findings can be used against them at the litigation stage
ombudsman practice therefore reduces the burden on courts
like system has several advantages over pre dispute mandatory arbitration but he success of such system also depends on number of other factors
first as raw lings and willet point out the success of model like will depend on publicity by companies
under the model the complainant first complains to the company firm hi ch in its response makes available the information about the ombudsman scheme
those companies against whom the ombudsman repeatedly render awards may not be willing to publicize the scheme raw lings
this makes it susceptible to the of samuel
this problem however can be overcome by facilitating general consumer awareness about the scheme by regulatory authorities
second if the model is copied without any adaptations or modifications it risks ad op ti ng the elastic interpretation of the and standard used by the ombudsman
it is contended that wide interpretation of such standard can lead to distorting the law which will generate legal uncertainty that will deter firms from ning the scheme mac neil
this problem too can be overcome by providing for specific guidelines which ombudsmen must adhere to while deciding cases
third some commentators raise the question of supervision of ombudsman schemes and good practice am ombudsmen
this criticism can also be dealt with by adhering to the code of ethics standard of practice and best practices of the international ombudsman association
furthermore when compared to court litigation face some limitations ie it is incapable of resolving disputes with collective dimension or which involve conflict between the roles of adjudication and regulation or cases which involve complex contested factual issues kelly and ne hf
fe as ib il of an like system in the american setting the suitability of an like system has been illustrated above but its feasibility in the american setting is separate question
historically ombudsman practice has been associated with fair play and accountability in democratic governance
given love for democracy it is in keeping with the american spirit of openness that provides fertile ground for the institution of ombudsman to grow and flourish
furthermore available expertise in the field to start an like scheme is yet another reason why it is viable in the us
organizational ombudsman scheme has been functioning in the us for long
many such schemes are available in universities institutions and corporations
the united state ombudsman association is national organisation for public sector ombudsman professionals which provides regular training for the development of the profession
though the above mentioned ombudsman schemes are based on the organisational or classical mo del their operation provides the insights needed for the successful implementation of an like scheme
therefore there is an existing ancillary support architecture which can foster the growth of an like system in the us such an initiative can taken up by the government at state level with monetary cooperation with journal of the international ombudsman association sh ar ma private firms as in the case of
state consumer protection offices can take up the initiative and integrate such system within the existing machinery of consumer protection
an like system holds promises of efficient and effective resolution of consumer disputes but there are two significant roadblocks that need to be addressed
firstly political differences that may render an like scheme infeasible in the us sc hw
the legis lat ions introduced to curtail mandatory arbitration are viewed by some as an attempt to save the us litigation industry
given that an like system impacts the number of litigations that reach the courts the idea of promoting an ot her alternative dispute resolution mechanism instead of mandatory arbitration is irreconcilable with these political motives and this may prove to be significant impediment in implementation of an like scheme
secondly similar schemes in australia replaced by the australian financial complaints authority and in canada ombudsman for banking services and investments ob si have received mixed reviews
for example the canadian ob si has been criticised in an independent review by pend er and deborah bat tell that it tilts the playing field in favour of firms and that the operating model makes it unable to prevent future complaints or lift consumer confidence ker ton and ad emu yi ya
similarly within the australian context study found number of shortcomings in the ombudsman system and recommended solving securities exchange disputes with arbitration ja beri because decisions made by ombudsman are not as easily directly enforceable without court intervention
while the iv es teeth to the determination by the institutionally setting up such mechanism in the us mandates that such shortcomings are meaningfully addressed
conclusion for long time in history questions have been asked if the american system can be improved by assimilation of ideas and concepts from the british system and vice versa
in light of proposed legis lat ions seeking to curtail mandatory arbitration the time is opportune to experiment with new ideas
the synergies the reaps given its uni que nodal position relative to other actors and the integrated multi tier dispute resolution it adopts to resolve consumer disputes highlight the potential of hybrid ombudsman schemes
most consumers business es have been fairly satisfied with the scheme in the united kingdom
it is likely that even in the american setting an like scheme will receive similar welcome and achieve similar results
there seems to be no extraordinary hurdle in introducing th concept
in the interest of fairness adversarial legalism of mandatory arbitration should therefore make way for an inquisitorial approach of ombudsman

issues of justice impact om buds as they frequently must manage both the justice expectations and the organizational priorities
om buds face pressure to both pro te ct the institution from harm and to advocate for individuals seeking to solve organizational problems
justice is not new concept in the om buds professional literature
while not categorized as the classical or advocate form of om buds who can conduct formal investigations and make recommendations organizational om buds at universities do wrestle with what constitutes justice
the university and college om buds association which has since merged with the adopted statement of ethical pr inc ipl es in that included focus on justice
the statement began ombudsperson should be guided by the following principles objectivity independence accessibility confidentiality and justice justice is pre she lt on
ethical principles further argued om buds should be guided by concern for and commitment to justice
justice requires that individual interests be carefully balanced with the consideration of the good of the larger academic community
his commitment to justice should include the understanding of power identification of the use and misuse of power and authority and recognition of the need for access to power by the members of the institution she lt on
the standards practice do not directly reference justice but do describe fairness and equity the ombudsman strives for impartiality fairness and objectivity in the treatment of people and the consideration of issues
the ombudsman advocates for fair and eq uit ab ly administered processes and does not advocate on behalf of any individual within the organization sop
om buds are frequently pressured to take sides and give advice
om buds often hear just or is real from their visitors who are often referred to the om buds and promised tell you what to she lt on gad lin pino
the om buds must determine what is fair or at least unfair and then also must also decide what steps to take in handling the concern kea sh ly gad lin pino
standard of practice states ombudsman exercises sole discretion over whether or how to act regarding an concern trend or concern of multiple individuals over
longtime om buds howard gad lin argues means exercising judgment the fact that we are not judges does not mean that we do not make gad lin
om buds inherently make determination of justice
in forma justice occurs where informal dispute resolution actors make determinations regarding the validity of the complaint and what constitutes process violation
therein lies the paradox of informal justice while presumably maintaining their independence and impartiality and making no formal decisions om buds still must exercise discretion in determining and then advocating for what is journal of the international ombudsman association pa pp as fair equitable and just
as gad lin and pino note tension between remaining neutral and at temp ting to correct injustice permeates all the activities of the
the paradox itself is found directly within the standards
first om buds must consider all legitimate concerns which requires they determine what is legitimate sop
om buds must also exercise their discretion to into procedural irregularities and or broader systemic problems when io sop
this also requires determining what is irregular or systemic
om buds also must make decisions or how to act regarding an concern or trend or concerns of multiple individuals over sop
in acting mb uds may advocate fair and equitably administered but may advocate on behalf of any individual within the sop
all of this must occur while om buds maintain their confidentiality requirements op
the tension between advocacy and impartiality is also not new in the literature
also referred to as neutrality gad lin and pino describe it as ultimate standard of practice for an om buds demanding fairness objectivity nd even handedness despite personal preferences partisan commitments previous experiences and individual
as om buds unavoidably influence experiences and the situation impartiality is elusive goal to which om buds aspire but only sometimes kea sh ley tom kins by er rudolph
like anyone om buds also hold unconscious preferences and implicit biases that enter into their decision making and choices when inter venin in conflict brothers gold berg
research indicates perceptions and interpretations of what constitutes is mediated by two factors how they define and identify the issue and the story and what they saw heard and felt escalan te
om buds must navigate their own views of what constitutes fairness and correct process separating what they think should happen from what their visitor wants to happen
maintaining an open mind is not an ea task as om buds only hear the view of the situation unless and until they talk to the other individuals involved
despite these challenges an impartiality is source of power providing legitimacy and trust for parties to share and be open to thinking critically about the conflict their role and possible next steps
views regarding impartiality vary and include pure impartiality multi partiality anonymous reporting and permitting or encouraging advocacy
pure impartiality requires the om buds to advocate for neither side nor for any particular result
described as non advocacy under this view the om buds should not advocate for anything including fairness or process to mp kins by er
given the ex is ten ce of implicit biases pure impartiality may be impossible to realize
in contrast multi partiality is defined as the om buds supporting all parties to the dispute and treating everyone equally stu rm gad lin
given different per so na li ties and situations both pure impartiality and multi partiality may perpetuate power and status inequalities given the of bureaucratic processes gad lin pino
many om buds maintain separation between impartiality and advocacy by only making recommendations when the anonymity of visitors can be maintained
anonymous reporting is governed by standard of practice ombudsman identifies trends issues and concerns about policies and procedures including pot en ti al future issues and concerns without breaching confidentiality or anonymity and provides recommendations for responsibly addressing
om buds who identify problems with policies and procedures are often then asked to participate in the design new policies
such work can still compromise or be seen as compromising impartiality when future visitors raise complaints and problems regarding those policies gad lin pino
journal of the international ombudsman association pa pp as due to these issues many om buds believe advocacy is part of the work and the standards need to be adapted to reflect the reality gad lin
for many reasons conflict resolution theorists argue for rethinking the impartiality of role mayer stu rm ga dl in gad lin
first maintaining clear separation of advocate and neutral role is impossible when all of have an impact on both process and mayer
second neutrals who are ineffective ad vocat es cannot serve their disputants as neutrals often advocate for someone to accept compromise mayer
by embracing more active advocacy role mayer argues neutrals can have greater impact and begin to see the social change that attracted so many to the role in the first place
om buds are not the only neutrals to wrestle with issues of judgement justice and impartiality
one of the key ways of differentiating formal from informal processes is to examine the role
in legal settings impartiality operate along spectrum
with judge on one end and transformative mediator at the other
where judge in formal process is tasked with making judgements transformative mediators in an informal set ting are to empower the parties by maximizing their self determination over both the process and the outcome bush fol ger
in between these ends are shades of gray and arbitrators evaluative mediators and facilitative mediators
where an arb it rat or serves as judge in less formal setting an evaluative mediator makes suggestions pressures resolution by evaluating the situation in terms of the law and what the courts might do
facilitative mediator controls the process and facilitates on versation to help the parties make their own decisions about the dispute
within there are widely varying perspective regarding the interpretation of role and when they may be combined pa pp as
each of these roles si mi la rly must wrestle with the different forms of justice adherence or departure from their respective ethical codes and professional requirements and the paradox of informal justice
what differentiates the impartiality of neutral who is designed to ake judgements from neutral that is not
the code of conduct for united states judges defines impartiality as personal bias or prejudice concerning party or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the canon
the code also defines impartiality as avoiding conflict of interest such as where the judge served as lawyer in the matter in controversy is related to the individuals involved or holds financial interest in the subject matter code
while the model standards of conduct for mediators echoes many of the above issues impartiality is more complicated standard ii
comment ers favoring facilitative mediation advocate for higher level of impartiality
for example in rd er to maintain their impartiality mediators should not have the authority or responsibility to determine the fairness of any particular outcome mayer
mediators should also avoid supporting any party and avoid influencing the outcome without th consent roberts palmer
on the other hand comment ers favoring evaluative mediation view the role as to safeguard against injustice and ensure the final agreement is fair suss kind
the mediator must balance too intervention which hinders party self determination with too little intervention which creates an uneven balance of power co ben
intervention in the evaluative framework may be necessary to clarify legal issue ensure accurate advice has be en given to the parties and to intervene if negotiations are not conducted in good faith ha yn es charlesworth
there are fierce debates about the proper role of mediator but om buds can be differentiated from other neutrals in that they are not formulated solely as dispute resolution mechanism
where an evaluative mediator can advocate for specific solutions or outcomes the mediator is not part of the community impacted by the result
om buds typically operate within an organizational nv iron ment in which they are also members of the community and may interact with the parties again in the future
om buds can also be differentiated from mediators in that journal of the international ombudsman association pa pp as om buds do not only handle issues once they become named disputes fels tin er abel sar at
om buds are also similar to mediators in that there are different ways to think about the role many hold themselves to higher standard of impartiality and independence where others believe advocacy and justice are key part of their oles
this article examines where those interpretations intercept
with multiple aspects to justice multiple standards and complicated institutional environment om buds face difficult decisions when determining when to and how to intervene on rights based issues
burgess and burgess describe the justice dilemma and the tradeoff between impartiality and advocacy in cases where power is inequitably distributed neutral intervention often simply sugar coats the domination of one group by nother leading to an unjust result
in response to this problem the dispute resolution field has struggled to find way to add empowerment responsibilities to the role of the neutral intervener
unfortunately as the empowerment efforts ex pa nd his or her ability to successfully carry out the neutral role diminishes
burgess and burgess thus describe an additional aspect to the paradox of informal justice the very standards that provide the influence an om buds needs to be effect iv in the role impartiality independence informality and confidentiality also limit an ability to realize and deliver impactful results
using the frame of campus sexual misconduct this article adds to the conflict management literature by na ly zing the paradoxical nature of justice in informal settings and explores how organizational complaint handlers navigate the tension between advocacy and impartiality
methodology this study examines period of turbulent policy change and inv es ti ga avowed standards of practice versus their actions when handling campus sexual misconduct allegations
data collected from included interviews of fourteen om buds and thirteen title ix coordinators from twenty two large colleges and ni ver siti es
open ended interviews content analysis and review of twelve hundred documents provide the basis for examining the work of campus based organizational om buds
the population numbered institutions was limited in several wa ys
first all athletics departments are division members and as athletic departments often wrestle with title ix compliance this ensures the participants all face certain level of complexity
second all universities utilized centralized title ix office with deputy coordinators
third all universities employed an om buds practicing to the standards of practice and providing informal services to faculty staff and students impacted by sexual misconduct
this essential re striction distinguished between the formal title ix and informal om buds dispute handling mechanisms
it was sufficient for an web site to note practicing to the standards of practice or mention the core standards of informality in depend en ce impartiality and confidentiality
to further distinguish om buds in and ensure any deviations from the standards of practice are informal rather than official the population was limited to om buds who did not serve as institutional agents capable of receiving
likewise institutions with om buds serving in dual roles that included significant management oversight function inherently able to receive notice were also excluded from the population
the resulting sample numbered twenty two institutions with participating title ix coordinators percent of the population
none of the participating om buds percent of the population served as agents of notice but one om buds was required to report sexual misconduct by institutional rule
concerns regarding confidentiality restricted the sample size in number but journal of the international ombudsman association pa pp as not in geography five worked at universities in the west seven in the midwest six in the south and four in the east
of the twenty two institutions are public doctoral level universities
of the om buds are female are male are african american are caucasian and is hispanic
the small sample size limits the ability to generalize the results to he entire population of om buds
the sample is not skewed in any obvious ways and believe the participants are likely more typical than unique
participants included range of levels of experience from those new in the role to seasoned long serving mb uds
the participants described wide range of misconduct complaints and included both uncontroversial low level situations and high level situations involving egregious abuses
data collection included two to three phone interviews per subject and lasted anywhere from hours
the interviews included pre determined list of questions to learn basic information about the individual their role and their institution
questioning often reveals socially and organizationally acceptable answers with om buds defaulting to their informal orientation when describing the basic purpose may nard moody mu she no the participants also shared and determined the definition of three narratives positive negative and most recent
er narratives were collected and data collection ended once saturation point of no differentiating information emerged from an iterative transcribing coding interpreting and interviewing process green thoro good ga skell
using arr at ive inquiry common elements and themes emerged polk ing hor ne cl and in in con nelly chase stake jones et al
to encourage participation the use of the narratives is restricted to maintain the anonymity of al individuals institutions and events
quotes from the narratives are used to support the findings and interpretations without detailing specific situations
changing the details ie gender or academic department of very particular cir cu proved insufficient for providing anonymity and often impacted the resulting interpretation
in determining themes both the depth and the frequency of statements were important
data analysis also incorporated review of twelve hundred title om buds and university sexual misconduct documents including news articles judicial opinions laws government policies professional standards and best practices and university policies
in total the data analyzed enabled robust analysis of om bu ds and how they navigate complex institutional environments undergoing dramatic changes in policy carval ho blo mgr en
findings every om buds participating in this study worked in an office designed to comply with the standards of practice
either the web site directly stated the office practiced to the standards or the web site listed the impartiality confidentiality informality and independence standards without mentioning the
in practice ow ever om buds varied from complete adherence to non compliance with the standards
complying om buds described how their practices remained consistent with the standards
for example an om buds described their independence if this office had rep ut at ion of being an agent for the institution no one would utilize our services because this community is small enough that word would get out that you go to that office because they are in bed with the
another om bu ds described exercising restraint in order to protect the impartiality standard journal of the international ombudsman association pa pp as never tell anyone what to do because think that impedes impartiality but what we do is talk about options and then its up to the individual to decide what options work est for that person
just as frequently om buds stated practicing consistently with the standards but then described violating the standards in the narratives they shared
for example here an om buds explained their role to visitors try to help them solve the problem and not be their advocate per
yet in situation involving visitor in conflict with department chair the om buds described advocating on the behalf spoke on the behalf and the said to them can go back and talk to the chair again but change his and the dean is not interested in removing him as chair so you really have any options
the visitors were very unhappy and so said talk with them again but think it will change anything
think that led them to complain about me but there was nothing else could do ob
another om buds noted the importance of the impartiality and independence standards om buds influence how decision is made if asking the right questions and asking from place of non identification with the organization
going to have fresh perspective our real power our ability to be independent and take it up the highest office within the organization and no office in
in describing specific decision however the same om buds described crossing the independence and impartiality lines sometimes have to make an executive dec is ion
if something is going to do significant damage to the institution might decide to go forward with that information
but have to be careful because people give me express permission to go forward and so do it because weigh the and conclude know this office needs to be aware of this it may cause significant damage to the institution
part of my job as an ombudsman is to give decision makers up
many om buds described their role as em powering visitors to solve their own problems
an om buds described their disappointment when leap into the effort to solve their problems but help them explore things that they can do to solve their own problems with the understanding that this is part of what it means to take responsibility for your adult
the same om buds also described situation in which he advocated repeatedly for reasonable accommodation for visitor trick is often in finding what rea so nable means in terms of reasonable accommodation and after made the third try for the visitor decided it was not in the realm of ob
what differentiates om buds who practice to the standards in both theory and practice from those that appear to deviate in practice
many om buds described their role as being impartial towards individuals and the institution but as partial advocates for fairness and equity
one om buds noted identify with the institution you ide with equity fairness and just asking practical
other om buds echoed this view with one noting impartial which means were not an advocate for any side but we are an advocate for fair ob
another uds stated can be advocates for we see policy or procedure has been violated we can certainly become an advocate for fixing ob
advocating for fairness requires determining whether something is unfair difficult task when the informality standard does not allow for formal investigations standard
om buds routinely described making determinations of policy violations in interviews with one noting lot of times we have to check the policies and get on what policies are and try to make sure whether anything has actually been violated
other om buds also described their effort to determine whether an issue requires their attention journal of the international ombudsman association pa pp as the visitor came in with conclusion ary sic wanted to probe some more to get more factual never got to all of that because she wanted something that she getting from me
uneasy when the visitor left suddenly because wanted to know more so that could really comfortably conclude that it really was not in violation of university policy ob
explain to them that my job is to sift through what you share with me or what is legitimate concern concern that really needs to be addressed and attended to and that gives me something to have conversation about and around and say is where can be an ob
sometimes you figure out far do dig and when do stop
do have enough information to know what really happened and proceed without making the student feel uncomfortable ob
paradoxically while serving as an impartial organizational mechanism that does not make judgments om buds one the less must make decisions as they determine whether there are procedural or equity violations
indeed standard of practice indicates ombudsman has responsibility to consider the legitimate concerns and interests of all individuals aff ec ted by the matter under
further standard of practice describes how the om buds may into procedural irregularities andor broader systemic problems when
as result om buds must determine what constitutes leg it im ate concern procedural irregularity or broader systemic problem
the om buds also must make decisions about when it is appropriate to intervene and how to do so
in navigating these decisions the line between being advocate in spec if ic instance versus an impartial neutral improving organizational processes blurs considerably
an om buds explained how they try to explain the difference between advocating for the visitor versus advocating for fairness and equity tell the visitor if your concern has legitimacy and something was done where it fair or it equitable and we proof going to be an advocate for fairness and equity
not saying going to be their advocate going to be an advocate going to be very fierce about being an advocate for those principles
in order to determine whether policy violation occurred often requires an om buds to act quite formally in gathering information there is or mal intake process
the to my office and fills out intake
them what the type of complaint it is academic judicial which department which faculty person was it personal was it hostile have many things for them to fill in
also ask them to first sign waiver giving me permission to talk to particular people or offices about their situation
typically what happens is ask them to do an intake for like said either done online or via paper and then on that intake form ask them for demographic information as well as their college if spoken to anybody before about this situation what has been the process that taken to
ask those questions because want to have an idea of how many people know about the case who can contact am starting from scratch have they already been told no and coming to me to try to find yes that gives me that sort of in for mat ion
when student comes in to see me it might sound like its investigation work but its very informal inquiries that are really pre emptive types of information
in other words someone might say suspect such and such is the case but dont want to file complaint if might be wrong about that but could you look into that
be real easy journal of the international ombudsman association pa pp as for an ombudsman to walk into the appropriate office and figure out whether if this grant got submitted and if it was zed
the visitor asks it was and if it is then im going to file formal complaint if you could find out that information for
once the om buds determines whether there is policy violation or an issue of fairness or equity the next step is deciding what to do with the information
how do om buds intervene while preserving the informality impartiality independence and confidentiality standards that guide the role
many om buds interviewed practice closely the standards but requires taking less direct role
for example rarely in less than one percent of cases will contact someone and here is why the act of contacting someone on campus on behalf of engenders perception of advocacy andor co ns tit ut es legally an neither of those is consistent with the standards of practice of our profession
would not their permission nor would name the individual about whom complaint has been made multi pl generic going to an administrator with responsibility over the alleged harasser and suggest that some sort of training effort might be advantageous for the entire unit
but think important that om buds remain neutral and not be leading the lynch mob kind of role
when describing the role nearly all om buds described their authority as the power of persuasion only power you have is what you can convince people to see or
in practice however many om buds take more active approach that can range from acting as mediator to directly enforcing policy
one om buds described what could be described as an evaluative role in working with faculty and students tell student has disagreement with your will come to me and will contact you and ask you for some information to either help the student understand why making the decision or try to convince you that the student has legitimate concern and try to get you to see their point and solve the issue satisfactorily their
other om buds described assuming policy enforcement role many offices resolve any issues because their perspective is just let us know what you want us to do and what ob
another om buds described working their way up the administrative chain to enforce policies if policy has been violated will try to get the permission to take it forward and if get that permission try to talk to the offending person and see if there was mistake made and if they want to correct
and if they want to correct that and we think that it was violation of policy and we give them an opp ort unity to make it right and they then probably go onto their supervisor and work our way up the chain
when om buds act as an advocate for equity or fairness those actions impact perceptions of impartiality and independence
of te actions are viewed as enforcing policy or advocating specifically for the visitor
for example visitor will come to us and say have problem with this person will you contact and very common misconception when we make the ca ll is for that person to feel that calling because in them it feels like we are coming out of the blue
been likened to being the office and getting called to the office and we have to say to them not making judgment about happened here
telling you that been given permission to talk to you to get information from you to see if we can better understand what can help resolve the problem
journal of the international ombudsman association pa pp as another om buds stated problem have is that faculty automatically assume when call them that am siding with the student which true
om buds frequently noted the greatest mis percept io about their role is that advocates for the visitors
om buds often perpetuate the perception of advocacy as they work to help their visitors
for example here om buds described statements to visitors that indicate persona advocacy following our discussion will have to speak with the administrator
still up to them to make the final decision however will share your concerns and hopefully have discussion that will allow them to understand your side
the to them to determine what the decision will be ob
talked to the people involved and this is the answer were getting and cant make them do what you want them to do
we have to live with this
there isnt any other option ob
further perceptions of what constitutes differ depending on the perspective as noted by one om buds impartiality is tricky their own definition of fairness and equity and if your definition and theirs align and still fighting for the fairness then the other side will say being their advocate because not letting this go oc
fundamentally it is very difficult to maintain the informality impartiality and independence standards illuminated by one experience attending hearings used to go to hearings as neutral non participating observer
people would say are going to be three or four people on the other side of the table and all alone at the disciplinary hearing will you come along just so have someone there
used to go and say the ombudsman am neutral party
my presence here should not be construed as support to any particular person or position in this matter
was out at one such employee hearing and stood up to say my introduction and before could even finish the hearing officer told me to up and sit down we know who here for
shut up and sat down it was his hearing
but never went to another hearing because it occurred to me that what stunned me was of course the going to be made that it was the employee who asked me to go there and that am there in support at least morally of that em ploy ee
first not going to be perceived as neutral second it was perceptions engendered from such activities are very risky when it comes to the standards of quit doing it
om buds closely practicing to the standards remain vigilant regarding perceptions of their actions
om buds who are less vigilant often directly advocate for their preferred outcomes and feel bad when they are not successful
for example personally speaking eel very bad when not able to give them the outcome looking for and tell them will try to help you resolve things in your best interests but sometimes that may not be the case ob
many om buds advocate for their visitors based on the specific circumstances including whether or not the visitor made good faith effort would be more likely to get involved if the person has made legitimate good faith efforts to solve the problem on their own
if the first wo or three steps would suggest are steps that already taken then might be more likely to take the fourth and fifth step to move this along
also think would be more likely to try if they were just so completely journal of the international ombudsman association pa pp as beaten by the experience an it would be somehow cruel to send them back out to try again without giving them something to work with to work from ob
always ask the student first can talk to this person about this
while sitting here can make this hone call on your behalf
they have the right to say do it but rarely do they object then call the other office and say going to send the student over to you the situation see what you can do for them
and ay be in that case am acting as an have about four or five students semester walking in who when you get into it the issue is really because of an issue at home their parents have thrown them out their drug addict their abusive something like that
frequently om buds assist by coaching visitors on how to better advocate for themselves
coaching occurs in various ways from indirect questioning to providing direct instructions will arm them will say order to get the answer to that question you need to talk to so and so that number the kind of approach that works best with that person how to frame the
it is amazing how many students come in and role play with them
will say need to talk to your professor about this
what are you going to say
and they come out with something that is so adversarial that like what do you think going to do
twice this week at least went online when student was sitting here went to web site listing elements of good apology and printed it off for th em and said read this
try to work with them on how to ask and who to ask and how likely it is that they will get the response they want if have somebody here that needs it might even outline it for them on piece of paper and say ere it is this is what you need to
while many om buds coach or directly advocate for their visitors other om buds work to further institutional goals including working to minimize lawsuits and avoid negative publicity my goal to resolve problems at the lowest prefer that issues are resolved at the lowest possible level to minimize lawsuits or people going to the press and saying not so nice things about people within the organization
prevention is something say it but think an expectation that the administration would like us to prevent problems that are sensitive from going outside the organization
decision makers prefer that issues like that are contained and ea lt with accordingly
om buds are also limited by institutional norms and preferences that favor certain groups above others
one om buds stated it most succinctly we get involved in grade disputes because not going to interject ourselves guessing faculty who are above reproach here as they are at many
in addition to and institutional goals om buds also act to further objectives that are important to them
one om buds noted really see my role as retention role
another om buds also described focus on student re ten ti on and support to be honest my favorite part of my work is challenging the faculty
the faculty has somewhat of privileged mentality
they act as if the sun rises and sets on them and their particular course is the only course of value at the ns tit uti on
our faculty needs to be more flexible in how they teach and in complex issues facing the journal of the international ombudsman association pa pp as
if retention and graduation is important then providing the support to the students to be able to do that is part of what be part of the mission
the most frequently stated om buds goal is to maintain the support for the om buds office still have to keep finding support for your office because when people leave that are in the admin ist ration and replaced by people who may not have the understanding or appreciation for the office you have to get in their good graces so kind of constant
om buds often try to influence the per cep ti ons of their efforts and thus become invested in the outcome of an issue did not want to see the visitor write letter that was flaming and threatening and that kind of if somebody sends very vitriolic letter will the administration look at it and think is kind of waste of time and reflect on the om buds office and think you supposed to keep these kinds of disputes away for me and not necessarily bring them to me
am unneutral about the outcome of whatever ap pens here have now become think somewhat invested in the process going ob
maintaining administrative support typically requires solving problems and om buds frequently described wanting to efficiently handle issues my initial go hoping number one to make it our last meeting
so my goal in any session is to basically short circuit all the other stuff their feelings their emotions whatever but at some point while doing the we need to get to the point of saying is the bottom line
these are your options these are the things that can be tackled in terms of trying to address this
om buds also discussed challenging individuals in order to encourage and fac il it at resolution for the people that are little more crafty the ones that wanted to not compromise and get everything that they wanted at the expense of someone else when realized really going to have to develop your game in order to in respectful way to challenge those kinds of personalities
so now them on the ropes and let them off as the saying goes oc
in order to solve problems om buds work in various ways to manage their expectations
one om buds described what they say to their visitors need you to understand my three values first given my role as an ombudsman value the collaborative process
the second value is and then on the tail end of compromise sacrifice and then also say need everybody involved to be adult and mature oc
another om buds noted their standard warning as means of providing realistic picture of what is possible is what we call faculty governed univ
what that means is that the faculty run the show they have the power
times when students or clients have concerns or problems they go immediately to the chancellor or the president or the provost thinking they can resolve it
in reality those individuals actually work at the behest of the faculty
so lay it out to them very clearly that what up against and to avoid any illusions that something other than what it is because it
given the nee to maintain administrative support om buds struggle with whether how and when to pursue and fairness and equity
the following om buds described it most clearly journal of the international ombudsman association pa pp as sometimes as an have to ask yourself going to be pursuing justice for sake and barbed with so many politics should pursue it or wait for the correct timing
like that old saying rush think sometimes you have to be smart about how you fight for fairness and justice
sometimes tell visitors wanting fairness and equity look at the the the what can change what might change and not going to change
and they say you advocate for fairness and and say lute ly and the reality is what it is the justice seeking in the the timing of the not happen and it goes back to being realistic and not as an om buds you want to throw yourself on the sword seeking jus ti ce
questions of advocacy impartiality and fairness are particularly challenging when rights based issues such as sexual misconduct are involved
for om buds adhering to the standards dealing with sexual misconduct is the toughest part of the job as the following om buds described the hardest part of this job is knowing that in the next year or two there will be another one of the faculty victims in my office and an innocent person out there who may not be in the pro gr am yet going to be somebody stand up and stop it
the only people that standing to do that is victim
will tell people you choose to be out from under this control please consider ting down your experiences and sending them to the dean or appropriate individual so that some kind of record frankly that almost never want to start new chapter in their life and put this behind them but yeah my prefer enc is that these people stand up to these victimizers and call them out for what they are and put them and the people responsible for their behavior on notice so that we can reduce the chances of future innocent victims
do ever make consultee aware tha my preference
that would not be being neutral on my part ob
om buds handling sexual misconduct issues also make judgements about the legitimacy of their complaints
multiple om buds described helping their vi si tors to understand what constituted discrimination and what did not lot of what comes in here talking about discrimination is really just been treated badly or been treated unfairly
it really lot of wind up educating people about what discrimination really not just rudeness and incivility and disdain for people ob
it never even crossed the mind that it was sexual harassment and one of the roles we play for students is hat labeled the behavior for them
they come in and they describe and we say know that sounds like sexual they go
om buds use multiple strategies for handling sexual misconduct complaints including conv inc in visitors to report the information to the title ix coordinator we do listen to sexual harassment complaints but we always try if we think there is any legitimacy to them even if we think there is we offer the option of walking those people the formal office
certainly if think case should be going through the title ix coordinator would send them over
any time dealt with sexual misconduct worked to get the individual to the title ix oord in at or and file complaint
journal of the international ombudsman association pa pp as many om buds attempt to convince visitors to come forward but would not do anything to violate their confidentiality would hope that could be persuasive enough with one or more of the victims here that would put them in place where they would be willing to speak to our title ix coordinators or the police to go ahead and file reports about that or request release from their confidentiality promise so could do something on their behalf
re all do again think that it is critical part of the service that offer that it is confidential and would really protect that value even at the risk of some others
sexual harassment you peck at numbers and say just one
do not have permission and have to anonymity never going to be able to go forward because the situations are too unique
of the time all can do is try to work with my visitor to try to see if way th at comfortable going forward just feel like that person is very vulnerable and do anything to endanger them
it really ties my think ever been in situation where felt could provide enough anonymity for my visitors that could go forward with those issues
other om buds are more willing to make sure the individual makes the report even if it means going against the standards of practice would say to the visitor so not willing to do this can you allow me to in an indirect way go to the dep art ment chair and say need to go to the title ix coordinator and let them know that there are allegations that this faculty member is engaging in this kind of behavior
kind of going in an indirect way
another om buds told me that we would never do nothing we would keep moving forward until this thing got addressed
would do whatever it would take
after learning about the various options the visitor wanted to have meeting with our title ix coo rd in at or all met together
once the visitor started telling what happened she was putting the organization on notice saying that there was sexual harassment
our professional association does not approve of that but am willi ng to do whatever it takes to get one of these cases to come forward
sometimes om buds on their own accord go directly to the title ix coordinator
title ix coordinators interviewed also indicated receiving assistance from om buds with one noting know who and know what the om buds came to me and gave me the who and the what and took it from ta
many om buds are willing to partner with the title ix coordinator or their staff on sexual misconduct issues
one om buds stated the title ix coordinator said to me like your help in dealing with would do it because the title ix coordinator is party to the ob
another om buds described sharing information with the title ix staff to help them execute their role the title ix coordinator is an takes very legalistic and is not one of the people that can go to and say you been hearing things about this department
have we got faculty member losing it over there
do we need as an institution to think about stepping in and doing something over there
would it help if went and talked with the chair or you went and talked with the chair
there are few staff members in these offices with whom have relationship like their bos se know it
the staff trust me and know that out them and need my input because happening in the classroom is very useful for journal of the international ombudsman association pa pp as them who then based on what have heard from students about this faculty member can take action
many om buds do not have the ability to follow the standards as many universities require the om buds to report any known instances of sexual misconduct impacting both the independence and confidentiality standards
om buds described the re su lt ing impact on their independence even though supposed to be independent not independent because we are required to be involved with title ix compliance
have to coexist with the offices with responsibility for compliance and if am out of here
could not use the word in my annual report because from the perspective if anything fell under then it would have been bumped to the formal office and it would ha been illegal not something that could deal of course you and both know that in most cases the harassment was not illegal and yes of course did deal with them but mark them that got to go with what each organization and general counsel feels comfortable with
many om buds under these restrictions described acting only with title ix coordinator approval used to have the option to resolve issues of sexual harassment informally which of course is hat we do as an office
now we cannot do that without asking permission from the title ix ob
om buds also intervene and advocate for their visitors
for example tomorrow going in to meet with supervisor who is totally eh ind an accused of very serious behavior probably emotional abuse and think workplace bullying
how am going to convince that person to look into the situation take it seriously and figure out going to be done
other om buds described what they say to try to convince an administrator to act look over the last number of years had number of different people come to me and tell me this general kind of story about this faculty me mb do investigations apply lie detector tests but those numbers of people telling me an almost identical pattern of
am concerned and hope that you are sooner or later one of these people is going to take one of the formal options telling them about and that will result in an investigation embarrassment and hassle that could be avoided if were to be altered
so whether any truth to these allegations or not and no saying there is just saying that even if all made up my job is to tell the visitors that one of their options is to go to the formal office and file charge and ultimately to the that will result in federal inv es ti ga tors poking assume that you would prefer to avoid that
so just thought want to know ob
just as in other situations om buds working on sexual misconduct issues also advocate for their own goals
om buds specifically ex pres se their preferences for using informal rather than formal dispute systems
for example have something to send it through grievance procedure because have never seen anybody win their case
want to say that deter from formal options what do is recommend that they talk to the formal personnel confidentially to get feel for what that process might be like and then decide if something that want to do or if something that can hel them out with
right journal of the international ombudsman association pa pp as now the formal process system of frustration for students and staff and faculty to utilize as never seen anyone win case against victimizer
in conclusion there are variations among om buds in how th ey navigate the standards of practice
the paradox of informal justice impacts them all in the course of the work om buds make judgments about whether something violates policies or principles of fairness and whether and how to act in response
while in practice all om buds interviewed work in offices structured to practice to the standards in reality principles of fairness or equity frequently blur with advocacy for specific individuals and their preferred outcomes or for institutional goals like min im izing liability or negative publicity
often these goals overlap and the distinction is less obvious as om buds assist visitors to be better advocates for themselves or advocate for the principles of fairness that impact both their visitors and the ins tit uti on
complicating the equation om buds also advocate for their own interests and are very conscious of how their actions impact the reputation and efficacy of their office
as result om buds vary in how they make advocacy versus impartiality dec is ions
the calculation is especially heighted when handing rights based issues like sexual misconduct where advocacy often requires revealing confidential information
this study indicates interpretation of the standards impact how they ef fec tu ate their roles
the study raises important questions regarding the role of informal mechanisms for handling rights based issues
in the next section this paper discusses the implications of the paradox on the om buds role and recommends re evaluating he standards to provide greater clarity
discussion this study examines fundamental tension within the om buds role described as the paradox of informal justice
an fundamental power derives from trust earned because of the confide independence impartiality and informality
om buds are influential because the role is seen as impartial
how do om buds maintain their reputation for impartiality while advocating for systemic changes in the context of an individual complaint
individuals at odds with the administration often seek help from the om buds
how do om buds maintain the independence of the role given the need to maintain administrative support for the om buds function
how do om buds practice to the confidentiality st an dard when significant wrong requires attention and disclosure
while many om buds adhere strictly to the confidentiality standard miller argues the om buds strict adherence to confidentiality and informality is irresponsible who could not want to see perpetrators of sexual violence or any other kind of to the full consequence of their actions along with those who knowingly abet their horrible behavior
knowledge is responsibility and those in the know must also be held responsible for not acting on what they know if not acting betrays the public for some ombudsman informality offers too much ambiguity and confidentiality is seen as conspiracy to preserve the interests of such perpetrators against the ex er cise of
each of these questions and the paradox itself is rooted in different interpretations regarding the om buds role and how the standards should be executed
as this findings indicate many om buds view the standards more strictly and take more conservative approach to their work
other om buds feel strongly that their role is to solve problems and advocate for just outcomes and they are willing to fl ex the boundaries of the standards in order to accomplish those goals
regardless of how the office is framed all om buds experience the tension between adhering to the principles and maintaining their ability to be persuasive and effective
journal of the international ombudsman association pa pp as there are both advantages and disadvantages to using approach to the standards
on one hand there are few size fits approaches that govern the diversity of situations om buds face and the ambiguity within the standards may pr much needed flexibility for om buds to adapt to varying circumstances and the needs of the specific community in which they work
the myriad of factors may be too varied and complicated to be reduced to standard guidance when the easy answer may be it depends on the
further interpretation is not unique to the om buds field gad lin and pino differentiate theoretical impartiality with functional impartiality as they note matter how rigorously defined every profession is int er pre ted differently by its various
on the other hand ambiguity makes it difficult to clearly communicate with wide variety of stake holders regarding the nature of the role
lack of clarity regarding what the role is in ten to do and what the role actually does can weaken the efficacy
without firm goals and boundaries expectations can pressure om buds to be their advocates
one om buds noted acting in way that goes against the neutrality stan dard but think om buds have often been thought of as more of consumer advocate and that might be the problem we need to refine understanding of what an om buds should
where does that leave om buds wrestling with how advocate for fairness while maintaining the standards
ultimately the question becomes what is an om buds designed to achieve and are the standards helpful in achieving those ends
if the goal is resolution of complaints does the om buds mech an ism have the tools for effectuating that goal
om buds lack standards and guidance for providing third party resolution services including what constitutes visitor self determination and what exceptions apply for confidentiality purposes including how separate meetings with the om buds should be handled and how any agreements might be documented and enforced
if the goal is substantive justice does the om buds mechanism have the tools for achieving that goal
om buds lack mechanisms and st anda for formal investigation and adjudication useful to determining and have no ability to determine outcomes and enforce policies
if the goal is procedural justice does the om buds mechanism have the standards and mechanisms to achieve hat goal
procedural justice provides individuals with and participation within complaint procedures and leads to greater acceptance of substantive outcomes
achieving procedural justice requires the om buds to advocate for procedural fairness in the context of individual circumstances
achieving either form of is at the core of the paradox of informal justice the om buds must determine what is unfair how to remedy the problem and how to maintain their impartiality while so
in protecting against procedural irregularity om buds must determine how to advocate for fair procedures or fair results in the context of an individual complaint without appearing to represent the visitor
with new title ix rules in place pro vi ding for now is an excellent time for the and its members to think through and clarify the goals and standards of the role
am not suggesting that either resolution or justice should be standards but that the con ver sati on is an important one
currently the value of the om buds role varies from campus to campus as the value often relates more to the person than to the role itself
as casey notes efficacy of the organizational om buds function from the personal characteristics and expertise of the om buds rather than the processes and
lack of clarity around advocacy makes it more difficult to professionalize the om buds field
need to professionalize does not mean the om buds field currently lacks professionalism
occupations seek legitimacy and influence by professionalizing and homogenizing their fellow workers
professional associations regulate the knowledge necessary for carrying out essential functions create and implement the standards used to execute the role and even socialize their journal of the international ombudsman association pa pp as members into the profession in terms of shared identities no or de gra af van der steen van twist
legitimacy and influence require occupational recognition that develops through awareness of the role and the consistency of the practices
om buds spend much of their time explaining what they do
as one om buds explained hear that lot is an
clarifying the standards will aid in professionalizing the field but that does not require homogenization
the could differentiate the standards and create of organizational om buds
alternatively the might clarify the standards to provide in cre as ed guidance for om buds who advocate for resolution or justice
these options are not mutually exclusive
of course greater specificity and guidance from the on these issues may in itself formalize aspects of an informal om buds role
over time as in formal dispute resolution mechanisms are recognized for delivering greater satisfaction in less time and at lower cost they are institutionalized and experience significant pressure to formalize nol an ha ley
for om buds formalization is evident in efforts to require om buds to be mandatory reporters of instances of sexual misconduct pa pp as
am not an om buds but as you consider revisions to the standards please protect what is unique and special about the om buds function
neither us tice nor resolution are unique to the om buds role
yes om buds provide interactional justice and should treat all visitors with kindness and respect and help their visitors to feel heard and to think through their options
om buds also can prom is complaints will at some point be brought to decision attention anonymously and confidentially
fundamentally an om buds serves as the warning system that enables the institution to make systematic improvements
by preserving anonymity and confidentiality om buds become the or for problems that may otherwise never be expressed
this confidentiality protection paired with the impartiality is what encourages individuals to come forward and gives the om buds the chance to inform administrators of problems that would otherwise not be on their radar
this is the special power and the value of an om buds
administrators can then make systemic changes that improve the justice and fairness of the entire organization
om buds enable organizational leaders to fulfill their obligations to deliver resolution and justice
in order to serve in this unique role om buds must maintain their reputations for confidentiality impartiality informality and independence
om buds need guidance navigating the paradox of informal justice and negotiating the boundaries between advocate and neutral
rethinking goals and standards will protect against unintended formalization and expand the influence and use of an essential campus role

journal of the international ombudsman association establishing quasi om buds program at large university by adapting brett and dispute system design model experience
first of its kind quasi om buds program at large university in the southeastern united states was established in after need was identified to supplement existing formal grievance processes with an informal alternative
brett and dispute system design mod el was selected primarily because it is authoritative in the dispute system design field and secondarily because it has been successfully applied in another university setting
three adaptations were made to suit the needs of the university adjusting the role of the design committee scaling down the diagnosis and scaling down the six design principles
the success of the program demonstrated the model can be successfully adapted by practitioners in the field to design an om buds program
or ds om buds university dispute system design conflict management conflict resolution journal of the international ombudsman association chat eh this paper describes the establishment of quasi om buds program at large university in southeastern united states as the main source for informal conflict management at the university
the term quasi om buds is used here to mean the program enshrined all of the principles of an om buds program except in depend en ce because the institution was still journeying towards the concept of having an independent program
the university has an enrollment of over students and more than faculty and staff
the impetus for the program was perceived need to pr alternatives to the existing formal grievance processes
the purposes were to establish program that offers informal conflict resolution services such as mediation facilitation and conflict coaching to faculty st af administrators and student employees to offer programming on informal conflict management and to report to the institution on trends and patterns present in conflicts arising on campus
as the candidate hired to establish and run this pro gr am chose to apply the design methodology presented by brett and gold berg in getting disputes resolved which is with being the first book written on designing dispute con be re
expected to follow the fou phases of the dispute resolution approach proposed in this book as stated by the authors
however this turned out not to be the case as discovered the need to adapt the methodology to provide immediate informal conflict resolution services to fa cult staff administrators and student employees
this emerging need reflects the unique nature of conflict and governance in the university setting
conflict is an inevitable phenomenon in institutes of higher education mali hah and supr iyo no selter en nis west wart ers holt on mc car thy however conflict resolution cannot always proceed as it does in corporate settings because of differing governance structure which is multifaceted and often entails boundary maintenance between the department and the administration as well as between one department and darken wa ld
the high costs associated with litigation have led many institutions of higher education to seek alternative low cost means of conflict resolution
an efficient dispute resolution program serves to prevent as well as to manage conflict effectively yarn bar sky
indeed preventing conflict from arising in the first place is en better than resolving it
hence one objective in designing this system was to provide services that would prevent conflicts from escalating into formal grievances and causing seriously destructive impacts
institutions of higher education use var iou processes procedures and systems to manage conflict
wart ers posited that mediation programs are useful because of the wide range of disputes they can address
furthermore offering mediation along with other conflict management processes provide fair and flexible means of resolving conflicts within the institution making successful resolution more
en nis proposed negotiation mediation arbitration and corporate discipline as four processes of conflict re sol uti on for christian institutions of higher education where corporate discipline represents the final decision on the matter with no recourse to appeal
another common approach to managing conflict involves the use of university ombudsman who advocates for fair process and seeks to eliminate any presence or perception of bias while also utilizing other processes to assist parties to conflict
in addition to intervening in individual cases the university ombudsman typically prepares annual reports systemic issues trends and patterns observed in conflict situations and presents these reports to senior administrators lei den frost
collecting and analyzing data on conflict trends and patterns is important for any institution of higher ed uca ti on seeking to continuously improve its performance international ombudsman association nd
accordingly reporting on such trends and patterns was required output of this initiative
journal of the international ombudsman association chat eh one of the better known examples of design and implementation of dispute resolution system in higher education is located within the university system of georgia
in the board of regents of the system commissioned study that included recommendations for implementing conflict management system across its constituent institutions yarn
the commission tasked with this mandate used the basic principles of dispute system design developed by et al
the success of this system in georgia speaks to the effectiveness of the methodology
the four phases of this methodology design implement and evaluate require at least months to develop to operational status depending on capacity wart ers
in our case the capacity consisted basically of one person me ma kin some adaptations necessary
the three main adaptations concerned the role of the design team scaling down the diagnosis phase and scaling down the six design principles
first adaptation the role of the design committee the role of the design com mitt ee is to assist the designer by drawing on input from potential program users in diagnosing the current situation and designing suitable conflict management system
it quickly became apparent that the role of the design committee as depicted by et al
required some adaptation because the mandate given by the university in this instance was not to overhaul the existing grievance system but to incorporate informal conflict resolution into the existing structure
hence the design committee was designated as consultative entity and called an advisory council
the first was to secure support and buy in from stake holders especially those who were not involved in the discussions that resulted in the decision establish the conflict management program
the parties are not involved in the design process they are less likely to approve the product no matter how good it is from an objective point of
the se co nd purpose was to obtain input on particular design considerations such as the scope of the program what cases would be accepted and the range of services that the program would offer
the members of the advisory council represented relevant cons ti tu faculty senate staff senate office for equity and diversity office of institutional integrity office of university counsel employee relations human resources the school of medicine dean of offic and office of student rights and responsibilities
it was crucial to engage all these stake holders from different functional units to ensure adequate representation of the needs and concerns of each unit
second adaptation scaling down the dia gn os is for et al
the diagnosis component of the dispute resolution system answers three types of questions what types of issues how methods used to address issues and why reason for choosing one process over another
however in the present context the diagnosis phase focused on mapping out the procedures currently in use and then determining existing service gaps by interviewing key constituents and administering survey
these three methods produced ample information about he potential perception of the existing conflict management resources at the university
the stakeholder interviews also served as the first announcement of the anticipated availability of the program
mapping the current processes in use conc ep tu ally conflict resolution can be understood in three ways through interests rights or power
the interest based approach focuses on what the parties care about the rights based approach concentrates on ascertaining whose claim is right and the po wer approach focuses on who has the ability to influence events by executing an action detrimental to the other party or by journal of the international ombudsman association chat eh threatening to do so example when supervisor threatens to fire an employee unless change in behavior occurs et al
the university already had seven different formal grievance processes and procedures in place each one was applicable to particular constituencies and different categories of grievances
these processes and procedures included the following prov is io ns described in the faculty manual procedures for staff subject the state human resources act procedures for staff exempt from sh ra the notice of nondiscrimination and affirmative action policy which was enforced by the office for equity and diversity student affairs procedures procedures implemented by the dean of students and separate set of guidelines used at the school of medicine
all seven were rights based processes associated with fulfilling either federal or state requirement
it is quite possible that administrators of these processes sometimes used informal approaches to assist involved parties in resolving situations that did not yet fall under the purview of their formal procedures
however the map pi ng of procedures revealed the pressing need for the development of centralized interest based conflict management resource
disputants are more likely to become entrenched in their positions when they have no access to an informal conflict management pt ion
since rights based approaches to conflict management had become the procedural norm at the university gaining widespread acceptance of the proposed informal conflict resolution program was going to take some time
strong institutional support and extensive promotion were seen as important ways to achieve the desired broad awareness and acceptance
discussions with key constituents interviewed key constituents in the university community
some of them were selected because of their leadership role others because they were involved with administering the formal grievance procedures or had an interest in informal conflict resolution
these stake holders gave their unfettered opinion of the current processes for handling conflict at th university
seven prominent themes emerged from these interviews strong need for an informal conflict resolution program the duration of formal procedures was too lengthy the existing processes tended to be complicated the procedures were adversarial and did not foster collaborative problem solving cultural change there was great need to change the current adversarial culture of conflict management institutional support for the program would be essential formal policy governing the program was not recommended but respondents indicated that statement of the support of it would be useful this consensus on not adopting formal policy was understandable because policy adoption itself is an area of frequent conflict at institutions of higher education as at many other organizations
typically policy decision making responsibility is not confined to one entity but rather resides with multiple groups within the institution which may have shared vision but competing interests yar
this situation results in the unintended consequence of tolerating policy related conflicts as the time frame available for achieving resolution is too lengthy kling el and ma ff ie
the themes gleaned from the interviews of key cons ti tu en ts informed decisions on the parameters of the services to be offered such as ensuring that the procedures remained simple journal of the international ombudsman association chat eh and of relatively short duration
in addition they confirmed that the effort to create quasi om buds program or informal conf li ct resolution program was justified
survey on november submitted request to administer conflict management assessment survey to the survey review and oversight committee sr oc through the institutional planning assessment and research office of the university
the sr oc approved this request on december with proposed administration date of february
random sample of participants full time permanent faculty and staff selected
the survey was admin is ter ed between february and march with three weekly reminder em ails used to encourage responses
to gather rich dataset the survey contained both closed ended quantitative and open ended qualitative questions
its nine questions cover ed the knowledge of the availability of any conflict resolution services their prior use of such services their willingness to use these services their thoughts on ways to improve the current dispute resolution system and their views as to what an ideal informal conflict resolution program should consist of
secondary goal of the survey was to inform respondents about the planned new program
although the sample was not statistically representative of the full comp le ment of the faculty and staff of the university anticipated that the responses would provide good indication of what the university community would want in an informal conflict management resource
of the people invited to participate in the surv ey started it and completed it for completion rate of
of the were faculty and were staff members
analysis of the results yielded five conclusions mediation and facilitation were the two services most to be used potential users of the program would like discussions to be kept confidential fac il it at ors and mediators must be neutral and impartial flexibility in the delivery of services would be beneficial and the proposed services mediation facilitation conflict coaching would indeed meet the informal conflict management needs of the university community
third adaptation scaling down the six design principles to three et al
proposed six design principles focusing on interests incorporating low cost rights and power backups incorporating consultations ordering the procedures based on costs and motivating users
however in the context of the informal conflict re so lut ion of the university reduced this set to three focusing on interests ordering the procedures and motivating users and providing skills and resources
the other principles were not directly pertinent because the institutional prerogative in this instance was not to overhaul the existing formal grievance processes but to supplement them
implementation and evaluation based on my interviews with the key constituents and my mapping of current grievance processes concluded that the new program would add value to the institution
consequently codified prospective three fold mission of the program to educate members of the university community on conflict resolution to empower them to resolve conflicts constructively to provide services including mediation conflict coaching and other alternative dispute resolution services to members of the university community who seek assistance in resolving interpersonal conflict and journal of the international ombudsman association chat eh to serve as the centralized information repositor for informal conflict resolution at the university
in addition codified standard operating procedures sops to mirror best practices of the profession including confidentiality informality neutrality and impartiality the voluntary nature of participation and non alignment in lieu of independence
non alignment was used in lieu of independence to convey to visitors that the program operated without influence and input from the office where it was housed and also because there was at the time reluctance on the part of the institution to at tri bu te the principle of independence to the program
the program had multiple points of entry referral phone web site and email to allow users to select one most suited to their needs and also to provide more outcomes more voice and more se of et al
the program maintained close partnership with various campus constituencies in furtherance of its mission to provide an informal channel of conflict management
visitors people using the services were refer red to the program by other campus offices but the program did not make formal referrals to other offices instead visitors were given descriptions of the available options so that they could make an informed choice as to how to seek redress for their co
two primary service channels conflict prevention and conflict management were offered
conflict prevention services focused on equipping potential disputants with knowledge and skills to help them engage effectively in disputes
the services provided in this area included conflict coaching meeting facilitation workshops and training sessions and lecture series with guest speakers
another feature of conflict prevention implementation was the recruitment and training of mediators in differ units across campus
the potential mediators were recruited by recommendation only
solicited recommendations during my interviews with key stake holders and then asked those recommended if they were willing to commit to fulfilling mediator role for the program
if they had not previously received formal mediation training they were asked to complete the hour employment mediation training course offered by the office of state human resources
additionally the candidates were expect ed to complete clinical mediation hours in the county district criminal court prior to mediating cases at the university
mediation facilitation and conflict coaching interest based conflict resolution processes greater success rate than ts based or power based approaches
used multiple methods to promote the new program
first partnered with specialized resources such as the human resources department office for equity and diversity faculty senate and staff senate and prov id ed them with descriptive brochures for distribution
also created web site and used the internal list serv of the university to announce upcoming educational programming events
additionally promotional materials brochure pens and water bottles ado rn ed with the program web site and phone number were handed out during the weekly new employee orientation
my main method of soliciting input on the effectiveness of the program was to ask the participants to complete feedback form which contained que st ions on participant satisfaction quality of workshop content and suggestions of future workshop topics
the feedback regarding satisfaction and content were positive
during the first six months of the program gave feedback form to each ant receiving mediation facilitation or conflict coaching services however very few returned the forms
more frequently program users sent me appreciative em ails to tell me how beneficial the intervention had been for them
hence stopped re ques ti ng feedback at the end of conflict coaching facilitation and mediation services
conversely submitted an annual report of trends and patterns of conflict to the institution including recommendations for redress of systemic issues
journal of the international ombudsman association chat eh within two years the establishment of the program more than cases were handled more than workshops were delivered to total of over participants and more than people benefited from at least one of the service lines offered
although the service was open to student employees fewer than five student employees were referred to the program and no student made use of any service
final thoughts research and practice wart ers have indicated that launching conflict management program for an ins ti tut ion of higher education typically requires one year from the initiation of planning to the date when the doors open for service
most of this time is spent on planning and design
at this university the office staff during the design period consisted of one person
limited staffing was an important consideration that affected decisions to adapt the model proposed by et al
moreover this situation was unusual in that services were to be offered concurrently as the program was being de sig ned
purists in dispute system design might argue that the methodology used here differed substantially from that of et al
but believe most would agree that the model lends itself to adaptation given the varying needs of institutions of higher le arn ing and organizations
the success of the quasi om buds program during its three years of operation demonstrates its positive impact on the campus community and this led the institution to approve the establishment of university om buds program and the quasi om buds program became non operational journal of the international ombudsman association chat eh references bar sky

sexual harassment journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on introduction this article advocates the establishment of om buds offices in academic professional research associations
organizational om buds in universities and businesses are well known and widespread and they perform vital roles in such settings
organizational om buds offices are to date relatively rare in professional associations and some professional as so cia ti ons have created offices that adhere to model different from that of an om buds
where organizational om buds exist however they make important contributions to improving the experience of attendees at professional confer enc es
professional associations have established om buds offices in response to varied factors
despite the variation two sets of factors seem to prevail societal trends eliciting an proactive response in the form of the om buds office ch allen ges within the association already emerging inducing the association to react
in recent years one key motivating factor is that of discrimination and harassment
the leaders of professional associations have recognized that attendees were en count er ing bias discrimination and harassment in professional settings including conferences
this recognition then prompted the creation of resources
to date diverse models have guided the design and functioning of such offices
academic professional research associations can benefit in multiple ways from adopting the om buds resource
we appraise current structures and models adherence to professional standards and how associations might maximize the benefits
recognizing the recent arri val of in professional associations we close by reflecting on the broader implications of this development
we also indicate the benefits of adopting the organizational om buds model in particular to address harassment and discrimination as op pos ed to other models noted in our assessment
the history of the organizational om buds in response to harassment and discrimination the impetus for many organizations in the university and corporate sector to create om buds offices has arisen from societal trends and challenges within the organizations
one societal trend influencing their origin from the late and early has been harassment and discrimination
in fact one of the earliest offices founded in at san jose state un ive was established in response to of demonstrations by the united black student and legitimate areas of concern they raised recognizing the experiences of their community on and about jan zen
the purpose of this office was to out and facilitate the removal of discrimination of the basis of race creed and national benton
while founded with this initial purpose within year it expanded to deal with wide range of is su es across the institution
yet one of the key abiding functions noted by the first ombudsperson at san jose state university benton white was to bring about equality for benton
the specific need to address harassment and dis cr imi nation highlights the observation made by culp davis in even though americans have not yet carried the idea as far as the scandinavians have at least dozen american groups contemplating the fundamentals of our american arrangements have inde pen dent ly come up with the essential idea of the ombudsman or something resembling it
american ingenuity can adapt this basic idea to our institutions and can develop it further
our analysis discus se those associational om buds offices in existence or planned through early
journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on additionally one of the first university om buds persons james st at michigan state university noted that the role of the om buds is by the character and style of the person holding it and by his conception of his role as well as by the traditions and general nature of the particular rust
these early om buds offices in academic settings were later defined as
om buds offices have since continued to work in the area of harassment and discrimination
just how organizations have chosen to engage om buds in add res sing these concerns reflects societal trends challenges within the organization and the om buds themselves
results of the international ombudsman the professional association for organizational om buds practice and compensation survey highlight that om buds continue to engage in this area
the in sent survey to all members who were practitioners for the full year of as part of the biannual survey series
of the members listed at the time of the survey participated providing response rate of
approximately of respondents indicated that they dealt with based on monthly weekly or daily with again dealing with based on race
additionally over reported dealing with abuse bullying on monthly weekly or daily basis
respondents also indicated that of their most serious cases by their judgment were related to based on sex gen with of the most serious cases being related to based on
these responses indicate the complexity of cases as well as the overlapping nature of areas of concern
the international ombudsman ass oc ia ti on itself also recognizes the vital role of om buds in addressing harassment and discrimination
from to task force formed to address concerns related to the changing guidelines of title ix institutions of higher education given the imp ort an ce of confidentiality in om buds practices
due to unclear wording in the us department of handbook for campus safety and security reporting us department of education many colleges and universities made their om buds mandated ep ort ers
this negatively impacted certain om buds abilities to adhere to the international ombudsman association standards of practice and moved them towards office rather than an informal resource
felt that they needed to make statement about the damage to complainants and respondents in harassment and discrimination cases and the impact on other types of cases if mandated reporting were to enter the om buds space
to assist om buds in advocating for this confidentiality on tract ed with wilmer cutler pickering hale and dorr to create memorandum on om buds as confidential resource for purposes of title ix and act april in an effort to support om buds offices in maintaining their confidentiality
this memorandum also enforced components of the alone the first report of the white house task force to protect students from sexual the white house
this report also notes the importance of confidential resources for addressing sexual assault and places the om buds office squarely within that need
the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine also placed the om buds office directly in line with the needs of support for those working through issues of sexual harassment and discrimination in their report harassment of women climate culture and title ix is the statute of the education amendments of in the united states
title ix protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance
title ix states that no person in the united states shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance us department of education para

in this consensus study report johnson et al
na sem state re po rt ing channels outside of the usual workplace hierarchy such as an ombudsperson who can receive reports of harassment but are not officially part of the human resources or management response to reports of harassment can provide critical independent support to persons experiencing harassment
further brian research interviews with both title ix coordinators and om buds persons led him to conclude that strict compliance based regime that cannot guarantee confidentiality run by title ix coordinator will not be seen by campus targets as legitimate ie ab le to handle these issues but are an ideal mechanism for encouraging reporting of sexual
as result of their analysis provide support for the has specific language related to informal options su ch as an om buds they should provide alternative and less formal means of recording information about the experience and reporting the experience if the target is not comfortable filing formal report
after issuing this report na sem created the action collaborative on preventing sexual harassment in higher education
this collaborative composed of over colleges universities and research institutions has the purpose of together leader from academic institutions and key stake holders to work toward targeted collective action on addressing and preventing sexual harassment across all disciplines and among all people in higher na sem
issued commitment statement in june in support of the action collaborative on preventing sexual harassment in higher education and has an active role in the discussions through its representatives
additionally the journal for the international ombudsman association has ssu ed call for papers for special issue on om buds responses to sexual harassment and discrimination with the goal of increasing understanding of how om buds respond to sexual harassment within their organization and identifying themes and patterns to sh ed light on om buds practices
this active engagement by om buds at national level as well as at the local level indicates the organizational om buds continued commitment to bring about equality for and highlights that om bu ds offices are particularly well positioned to assist professional academic research associations in addressing these concerns given their own
the om buds in professional associations which associations have adopted om buds
to identify acad em ic professional research associations with om buds we draw information primarily from the independent voice of the international ombudsman association cf
spa ter ro th and ka lb as well as the om buds bl og an independent resource managed by professional academic om buds who also belongs to the international ombudsman association
these resources were selected given their reputation as providing timely notice of the creation and closing of om buds offices
once professional research assoc ia ti on was noted to have created an om buds office on either site we reviewed that policies and posting for the role on the web site
we define the scope of the stock taking as us canadian and national professional assoc ia ti ons focused on research in the humanities social journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on sciences natural sciences engineering and medicine
international professional academic research associations also enter our purview
we exclude from consideration any such regional associations altho ug we are aware of few regional professional research associations with om buds they are likely relatively difficult to track systematically as they may not announce their creation as broadly as the national organizations
with these criteria we count total of twenty national and international research professional associations with om buds offices
the associations with om buds span range of disciplines with the single largest group percent of the twenty from the social sciences
of the assoc ia ti ons with om buds percent are from the natural sciences
by our reckoning only five humanities research associations percent of the total have adopted om buds offices
our search of the bl og has identified no om buds office operating within pro fess ion al research associations from engineering or medicine
note however that the prominent report on sexual harassment of women issued in august by the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine endorsed the idea of om buds persons in universities and colleges na sem esp
rationales for adoption to date to our knowledge disciplinary leaders adopted om buds offices in professional academic research associations after they became aware of sexual harassment and discrimination in their discipline and in particular at professional meetings
perhaps the most well documented cases are the american political science association ap sa for which the om buds office dates to and the american economic association which established its om buds in
in the case of ap sa in late eleven senior wo men political scientists wrote letter to ap sa leadership to convey that they had received complaints of sexual harassment at prior annual meetings merv is sa piro and campbell cf
ethics committee in decide on three part response survey of ap sa members the proposal to the ap sa council of revamped code of conduct and the institution of an om buds
the survey fielded in early used questions on harassment developed by the department of defense the wake of the tail hook scandal
notably the survey revealed that almost one third of respondents had experienced some form of harassment in the four prior annual meetings with harassment more common among women and junior members of the profession and campbell
the code of conduct is now regularly and prominently disseminated before the annual meetings as is the new ap sa anti harassment policy
ap sa established co om buds program modeled on the organizational om buds in repeating it in and
in this design full time professional om buds and political scientist with membership and some om buds training work together as team
the created its om buds office in after the problems reached the at ion al news media
in prominent male economist was elected to the executive council only to resign soon thereafter amid multiple claims of sexual harassment against him
as the new york times reported in march more than percent of en in survey of the membership replied that they had been subjected to an unwanted sexual advance
half of the women surveyed as compared to three percent of the men disclosed that they had been treated unfairly because of their sex
noteworthy too percent of black economists surveyed and only percent of non heterosexual economists replied that people like them were respected in the profession casse lm an and tankers ley
among its responses to such evidence th adopted classical om buds in spa ter ro th and ka lb which is not the model broadly adopted and accepted by colleges and universities
we do not im to identify the universe of even just us national professional academic research associations with om buds in the humanities social sciences natural sciences engineering and medicine
again we rely on the independent voice and the om buds log as trusted likely comprehensive sources and supplement these reports with our knowledge given our expertise and networks
journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on the recent origins of om buds programs within ap sa and cannot be presumed to be somehow represent at iv indeed these programs may be distinctive as they arose in the wake of the me too movement
sparse evidence exists on om buds programs within other academic professional research associations
the american philosophical association apa created its uds program in apa nd
the american society of mammalogy instituted its om buds in ti mm mc lar en
acting in the era of ap sa and me too the american statistical association established its om buds service in
notably this last association contracted out its om buds to private company as tat sa
the latin american studies association created the positions of two co om buds in lasa mer sh on personal communication with lasa officer
whereas the dat es of establishment can with difficulty be tracked for some associations the rationale for the creation can be murky
equally important there are examples of associations in which awareness of harassment has not yet triggered the foundation of an om bud office
when the surveyed its membership so did the american sociological association as oca
the as oca survey revealed pervasive harassment and discrimination especially among women sociologists of color spa ter ro th and ka lb
in response the as oca adopted an anti harassment policy and in formed an anti harassment working group and made available vast array of anti harassment resources at its web site as oca
as of early has not however established an om buds resource
varied institutional designs om buds offices vary in scope in relation to number of staff constituents as well as reporting lines
as noted professional academic research associations have adopted different om buds models to address these concerns
three basic om buds models exist classical advocate and organizational
these three types of om buds have very distinct roles and history
classical om buds function in government to receive and investigate complaints as well as make recommendations for appropriate redress or policy change
these positions are often created by statute and adhere to four standards of practice as outlined by the united states ombudsman association
these standards are independence impartiality and fairness credibility of the review process confidentiality
an advocate om buds may be located in either the public or private sector but is authorized or required to advocate on behalf of individuals or groups found to be aggrieved
organizational om bud are designated neutrals employed by an organization to informally resolve concerns of wide array of constituents
organizational om buds adhere to the international ombudsman association standards of practice and code of ethics
these sta nd ar ds are independence impartiality and neutrality confidentiality informality journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on the major difference between these types of om buds is that both the advocate and classical om buds take part in formal resolution processes
additionally advocate om buds while objective are not neutral
finally it is important to note the description and role of compliance safety officer at this juncture as some professional academic research associations utilize the term to describe an individual wh ose role is not to act as an independent and confidential resource to review concerns but an individual to ensure compliance with association policies and procedures as well as laws and regulations as inferred through publicly available statements
in brief such organizations have co opted the term for roles that run counter to the goal of om buds practices
the model depicted in the na sem consensus study report on the sexual harassment of women describes means for individuals to seek assistance
the na sem report thus pointed to the importance of the organizational om buds role in these spaces
given the variety of associations now implementing the om buds role we have reviewed the language used in association web sites job post in gs policies and other related material to analyze om buds type and examine patterns of best practices
we now move to brief synopsis of each of the twenty professional associations we have identified categorized by disciplinary sector as of january
natural sciences american society of ichthyologists and herpetologists compliance
the om buds office for the american society of ichthyologists and herpetologists was implemented in to address the joint meeting of the american society of ichthyologists and herpetologists american elasmobranch society herpetologists league and society for the study of amphibians and reptiles
the joint code of conduct for this meeting states if you are witness to or are the recipient of an alleged incident of prohibited conduct write down the details as soon as possible and in as much detail as you can recall
next contact the ombudsperson trained unaffiliated professional hired to receive incident reports investigate cases and dj udic ate alleged violations or the leadership of any member society defined here as any member of the executive committee board of directors aes ss ar or board of trustees hl
while the ombudsperson is defined as trained naf filiated given the duties described it is not an om buds as someone performing compliance function the individual does not adhere to what are considered the international ombudsman association standards of practice
additionally in esp on se to an incident that occurred at the meeting the program schedule describes the om buds as
the role of an om buds for the appeared as result of the creation of the code of conduct for the american society for ich thy ologists and herpetologists approved in february
we cannot discern the rationale for the creation of the code of conduct
in the code of conduct an om buds is not mentioned
the code of conduct was sent to other members of the an initiative to create code of conduct
however it was ultimately the american elasmobranch society code of conduct that was used as basis for the
the created the office in but the date marks the availability to meeting attendees and thus we report that here
journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on in the american elasmobranch society it notes the om buds in the following man ne in the code of conduct you should then contact member of the aes equity diversity committee or member of the aes executive committee or send an email to email address again this appears as compliance function
as it relates to the code of conduct itself the american elasmobranch society states the code of conduct then was reviewed and adjusted by our legal counsel bricker associates to ensure that it was le ga defensible and follows existing laws and best practices
after extensive review of the web site no reference to any of the standards of practice or codes of ethics can be found
north american society for bat research classical
the north american society for bat research also established an om buds role for their annual meeting in
under the code of conduct for meetings and conferences for the north american society for bat research it states that the om buds serves as neutral and objective source of information and point of communication for members who have concern or grievance related to the possible violation of by laws or policies and may not advocate for any individual or group within
the om buds moreover serves as an official liaison between the membership and the board of directors works with the chair of the board chair of the education and outreach committee and the senior student representative if applicable when grievance is reported and may appointed by the chair to lead investigations into alleged violations of the code of conduct
from the nab sr web site it seems that the scope of their role is again to address concerns related to harassment and discrimination only
additionally from what has been published about these roles they are neutral and independent
however there is no mention of confidentiality and the om buds can be appointed to carry out investigations
while no standards of practice are mentioned directly in the de script ions found this role most closely relates to that of classical om buds
it is not fully classical model however as it has not been established by public statute and its adherence to confidentiality is unclear
in april the digital games research association announced call to appoint small group of people to share the responsibility of acting as neutral representatives mediating between members of the association and the board to resolve complaints and address issues that arise within the organization and membership dig ra
the impetus for the om buds role appears to have come from the diversity working group
the call for om buds persons states that the responsibilities this group of om buds will be the following journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on the team becomes the first point of contact to raise any grievances and concerns
the team revises maintains upholds and enforces the code of conduct for dig ra across games network discord channel dig ra international and local conferences etc
dig ra org the association dig ra mailing lists
the team feeds back to the dig ra board on existing mechanisms for addressing complaints and where necessary proposes amendments
the team ia is ons between the dig ra board the diversity working group conference program chairs and conference chairs to maintain fair practice standards for peer reviews
from the description provided for the om buds office in dig ra it follows most closely with that of compliance function as it maintains upholds and enforces the code of conduct for
it is the use of the term and the lack of articulating general standards of practice for any om buds type that centers it squarely in the compliance realm
additionally no information can be found related to the training of the individual holding the role of om bud american statistical association classical
this om buds program emerged from report of the task force on harassment and assault formed in november of
while outlined as an initiative from the american statistical association and founded in their code of conduct the om buds program actually served the joint statistical meeting that encompassed number of professional associations including american statistical association casualty actuarial society the caucus for women in statistics international biometric society en ar and international chinese statistical association international indian statistical association institute of mathematical statistics international society for bayesian analysis international statistical institute korean international statistical society royal statistical society statistical society of cana da the om buds services began in by contracting with an external consultant to provide services at its annual meeting in vancouver british columbia canada
in the policies and procedures for reviewing investigating and adjudicating violations of the activities conduct policy the following is given as the for using the om buds services alleged violations at asa activities will be investigated by the om buds service
an allegation of violation that ar is es on social media may also be reported to the om buds service through the same process
their recommendations will be reported to the review board for action
again this description lends itself to that of classical om buds given the pro cess and the apparent provision of the report to the board
it also runs contrary to what was outlined in for the inaugural year of the om buds program
in its description it states journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on the external om buds will keep all information you provide confide unless the external om buds assesses and finds an imminent risk to safety
over the days of the conference the external om buds will identify any trends and patterns arising from consultations and inquiries received following the conference the ex ternal consultant will report to the asa on those trends and patterns in completely an ony mi zed manner
external consultant also provided om buds services at the joint statistical meeting and it appears at the meeting
the final report of the task force on sexual harassment and assault published in january states as one of the task recommendations consider creation of resource that allows victims of sexual harassment and assault to anonymously receive support
we re pleased that the asa provided an om buds service for the and appreciate the plan to continue to use the service for future meetings
unfortunately this final report does not distinguish how the om buds will practice or its informal nature
as one of the om buds has served as an organizational om buds for an institution of higher education there is some understanding of the role within th association
in depicting the om buds the as tats uses prose alluding to confidentiality independence and neutrality as standards of practice
however given that the om buds conduct investigations and provide reports this om buds program appears cl assi cal in nature
moreover the as tat sa does not clearly state any adherence to professional standard of practice or code of ethics
the history of science society the largest society de di cat ed to understanding science technology medicine and their interactions with society in historical
according to their web site has over individual and institutional members worldwide
their om buds office was created to oversee its then newly created respectful behavior policy om buds bl og
in their respectful behavior policy the history of science society describes the role and functioning of the om buds office under their section titled if an individual or group of individuals believes that they have experienced any violation of this policy at society meeting or event the person or group should report the incident immediately to the society ombudsperson email address
although anyone may seek advice from the ombudsperson only the individual or individuals alleging that they have been harassed may file complaint
the policy outlines the responsibilities of the om buds as follows listen to the grievance describe the policy and procedures outline issues of privacy and confidentiality and discuss possible courses of action regarding the filing or non filing of formal complaint
take all reasonable efforts to maintain in strict confidence the identity of individuals report ing an incident and the person or persons implicated in an incident
prepare for council annually an aggregate an ony mi zed summary of all such reported incidents
the ombudsperson also takes part in the formal adjudication of complaints as outlined in heir processes
journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on again function of the om buds in the history of science society is to serve as an investigator in formal process
it seems that it is only informal to point and then the om buds actively engages in formal process
this would seem to make the om buds adapt to combined model changing from organizational to classical midway through handling an concern
additionally from the information available it does not appear that the om buds has received any training in uds best practices
thus from the description it appears that the om buds is again compliance officer as they not only investigate but also oversee the formal hearing process
the american society of mammalogy was established in to promote interest in the study of mammals
the is one of the first known professional associations to create an om buds program
the program was recommended in report committee on women and minor it issues later named the committee on human diversity
the program was instituted in at the annual meeting president patt on announced that he had established an ad hoc watchdog to be known as the ombudsperson to hear and respond to comp la in ts of unprofessional behavior by any member of the society at its annual meeting or in the governance of the society through its committee structure
formally instituted policy on professional misconduct in and according to their web site today the purpose of the office of the ombudsperson is creation of the office of the ombudsperson in itself is meant to discourage any and all inappropriate behavior on the part of the membership of the and all issues brought before either or both of the appointed individuals will be resolved as discreetly as possible
the om bud persons are entrusted to deal with each situation as they best se fit following procedures indicated on the office of the ombudsperson web page
according to om buds are also charged with adjudicating concerns the president appoints one or two society members to the office of ombudsperson
the om buds persons are charged with reviewing and adjudicating allegations of misconduct occurring within the context of society events or society sponsored activities in an effort to seek the truth as neutral designee
additionally after review of all materials if the office of ombudsperson determine that misconduct occurred and should be subject to disciplinary action the om buds persons shall communicate the charges of misconduct to the alleged offenders and inform the alleged offenders as to the availability for review of summaries of incidents and evidence supporting the charges
the alleged offenders will have an opportunity to respond to the allegations
these steps will be completed prior to the om buds persons deciding on an appropriate course of disciplinary action
from these descriptions of the role it appears that the is describing compliance function given that it serves to any and all inappropriate behavior from the web site it does journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on not appear that the om bud sp er sons have received any training as an om buds nor do they adhere to any specific standards of practice
as the om buds take part in the disciplinary process this practice does not conform to the role of an organizational om buds but that of com pli an ce function as it takes place in the formal processes of

from the full description in the policy and the reports provided to the aaa while not stated directly on their web site their om buds are adhering to the international ombudsman association
again there is no reference to their training as an om buds nor membership in an om buds professional association

their om buds program was established in and operates imi la rly to that of the american statistical association as classical model om buds bl og
this relationship is set to continue to the annual meeting as well
journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on in february the uds bl og noted that the american historical association had decided to open an om buds service to respond to sexual and gender discrimination in the profession om buds bl og
in that announcement it states drawing on processes adopted by other prof es sion al associations but duplicating none of them exactly we decided to name an om buds team consisting of designated members of the council and representatives from the relevant constituencies to receive complaints about harassment at our meetings
however after reviewing the web site and information related to their meetings it is unclear at this time if the om buds program has or will be implemented
that said from the description of practices it appears to be confidential neutral and in for mal
the only concern is the independence in appointing members of the council and representatives from the relevant constituencies
even with that caveat it follows the standards of practice and is an organizational om buds resource
american ol it ic al science association organizational
as indicated ap sa created its om buds office in response to growing concerns about sexual harassment experienced by attendees at professional meetings
the ap sa om buds office is composed of two co om bu ds in which full time professional om buds and political scientist who has membership and has some om buds training work together as team
ap sa makes clear that its vision of and practices for the om buds adhere to the organizational model
for instance ap sa posts code of ethics on its om buds web page and the page on the role of the om buds emphasizes the neutrality of the om buds
as stated ap sa meetings om buds plays no role in sexual harassment procedures
the om buds does not pro vi de legal advice and is not authorized to be an office of notice for ap sa
in march the ae ra announced that would introduce an om buds resource for participants in its apr il annual meeting
like the ap sa the ae ra chose the design of two co om buds one professional full time organizational om buds and the other social scientist benefiting from membership and some training as an om buds
in announcing the in nov at ion the ae ra executive director affirmed that the program strong commitment to fostering an inclusive supportive and respectful environment for all who participate in the and marks important step in the ongoing eff ort to enhance and expand its activities and initiatives aimed at preventing and responding to sexual and other forms of harassment or ae ra
the ae ra specified that its om buds program follows the standards of practice and code of eth
the model it has established is organizational
recall the context for the creation of the om buds reports of sexual harassment among members had reach ed national news media
the creation for the om buds role for the american economic association emerged from report by the ad hoc committee on the professional climate in economics
this report provided the following recommendation the committee re co mm ends that the further investigates the possibility of creating an ombudsperson position for issues related to discrimination and harassment
furthermore the leaned on the model established by the american philosophical association in their rec om men dation journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on the apa ombudsperson whose name and contact information is easily accessible on the apa web site receives informal complaints about possible violations of the apa
the ombudsperson will then try to resolve the matter and if the matter has een filed by an apa member and the complaint regards discrimination by an institution the matter may then be treated via the formal complaint process outlined above
the ombudsperson ordinarily sits on the ad hoc committees that review formal complaints
duties as outlined include plays an information role
offers the following services education about the apa non discrimination policy to the association memberships access to publicly available anti discrimination resources for complainant and help in gathering the or prospective relevant policies and procedures for complainants
does not provide legal services prepares annual reports including summary data on the number and types of complaints received as well as an ony mi zed information describing each complaint and action taken in response
while the did consider an organizational om buds model the association established an office that falls under the classical model the ombudsperson will take and per man record complaints concerning harassment or discrimination in any professional context advise and provide resources to individuals experiencing harassment or discrimination with the permission relay complaints to employers andor to liaison and as appropriate investigate or otherwise follow through on complaints
the ombudsperson will also help the association develop policies and programs to fight harassment and discrimination including offering training at as sa allied soc science association meetings
as the om buds participates in the formal complaint process even on an ad hoc basis it fulfills the model of classical om buds although again it has not been established by statute
the web site also state bend towards organizational now as the description of the services offered specifies that the ombudsperson does not represent the american economic association but collects information and presents independent solutions and guidance to both the and its constituents and stake holders
therefore communication with the ombudsperson does not constitute legal notice to the and will not trigger formal course of action or legal process by the
this web site and related materials reveal that the services provided by the om buds in their capacity as om buds are protected by their external appointment as an attorney and serving in contract capacity
their office does not only exist during the time of the annual meeting but as resource for me mb ers to contact at any time during year
additionally the scope of their work is limited to harassment and discrimination
other issues are addressed through other avenues within the association
the value of the om buds program for lies in the fac that their om buds is truly external to the organization and can focus specifically on the issue of harassment and discrimination
that said it also seems that gaps open in the ability to address concerns that fall outside this narrow scope and to address issues connected to other violations in the code of journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on professional conduct
additionally there are some discrepancies between how describes the role and how the role relates to standards of practice
created in the ethics om buds committee was established in the academy of management to assist its members with related to professional ethical conduct occurring within the day
the academy of management opted to use committee of om buds that adhered to the international ombudsman association standards of practice
in the initial article about their role it states the ethics om buds committee make decisions for the parties nor judge the merits of complaint
rather we provide alternative dispute resolution strategies to help you resolve problem or we might suggest you take the issue through ethics adjudication committee formal adjudication process
while not much is publicized regarding the om buds standards of practice the individuals fulfilling the role have backgrounds as organizational om buds and they refer to the formal systems but do not participate
thus academy of management has been categorized as org ani zat ion al
this is one of the newest professional associations to seek out the creation of an om buds program
before creating the role it consulted with the international ombudsman association to seek out best practices for an organizational om buds office
at this time it has only posted its request for proposal
in its request for proposal posted on the international ombudsman association job board it states our om buds must be comfort able addressing attendee concerns about safety harassment and micro aggressions in the interest of ensuring that our meeting is as inclusive as possible for archaeologists regardless of gender sexual orientation race ethnicity religion employment se ct or and status in the field
at this time it appears that saa plans to have their om buds as an organizational om buds that adheres to the international ombudsman association and is solo practitioner during the time of their annual meeting
ar cha eo lo gi cal institute of america society for classical studies organizational
the archaeological institute of am eric and society for classical studies host joint meeting and boast combined membership of over members
in their announcement the creation of their harassment policy and om buds program om buds bl og the major innovation in this policy apart from the fact that it is joint initiative of and is the addition of an ombudsperson who will be available at and after the meeting to receive complaints of harassment and advise complainants
this is further reinforced by the language found in their joint harassment policy the role of the ombudsperson is to provide support to those who witness or have experience harassment or feel unsafe for any reason at the conference
the ombudsperson will advise on the formal complaints process described below however the ombudsperson is not authorized to give legal advice adjudicate cases or remove journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on any attendees from th conference
the ombudsperson also serves as liaison to the joint rapid response team on site
as for qualifications candidates should have at least five years experience in dealing with harassment complaints including but not lim it ed to sexual harassment as an ombudsperson or equivalent position in non profit organization college or university
although the ombudsperson will not be providing legal advice knowledge of title ix regulations and experience in handling title ix ssu es will be valuable since many of our conference attendees are students and professors in us institutions
and are seeking an experienced individual with exemplary interpersonal skills high degree of discretion and the ability to work in high pressure environment during the four days of the conference
professional certifications provided by organizations such as the international ombudsman association are preferred
this position would be ideal for an experienced and recently retired prof es sion al or for an ombudsperson who works on consultant basis
there is the possibility that and would retain the ombudsperson for meetings in future years
from the description in the job posting it appears as they plan to have the om bud adhere to the international ombudsman association standards of practice
the american philosophical association the discipline and profession of philosophy both within the academy and in the public arena
the apa supports the professional development of philosophers at all levels and works to foster greater understanding and appreciation of the value of philosophical apa
this along with the american of mammalogy are the two oldest known om buds programs among professional associations
according to their web site the sole area of concern is that of discrimination and harassment
according to their om buds web site the ombudsperson con cerning discrimination and sexual harassment shall receive complaints of discrimination and where possible serve as resource to members regarding such complaints
the ombudsperson shall serve as resource by among other things educating the comp lain ant on the statement on nondiscrimination ii advising the complainant of publicly available anti discrimination resources and iii assisting the complainant in gathering the or prospective relevant policies and proc ed ur es
the ombudsperson shall communicate and coordinate with the committee on the defense of professional rights of philosophers cd prp where appropriate particularly if there is prima facie violation of professional right
the ombudsperson concern ing discrimination and sexual harassment in consultation with the relevant diversity committee may deem complaint not to merit further pursuit by the apa
the ombudsperson shall make clear to any complainants that the ombudsperson is not providing leg al advice and that the availability of an apa ombudsperson is not journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on intended to substitute for either making use of internal institutional mechanisms for addressing complaints of discrimination or for consulting expert legal advice
moreover it is not the role of the apa ombudsperson to assist individuals through their internal mechanism for pursuing complaint of discrimination
given that the om buds will it seems take part in formal process it has been placed within the classical model
again it is not placed here fully as it is not established by statute
note as well that no reference appears to any standards of practice as outlined by professional om buds associations
american society for aesthetics cl assi ca founded in the american society for aesthetics was created promote study research discussion and publication in asa
aesthetics denotes here studies of the arts and related types of experience from philosophic sci or other theoretical standpoint including those of psychology sociology anthropology cultural history art criticism and education
include the visual arts literature music and theater as aesthetics
from the web site its om buds program was established in in part as response to complaint of sexual harassment that was not handled appropriately by the organization
in the american society for aesthetics policies on discrimination harassment an respectful behavior approved in the om buds is described as the following there are two ways to involve the ombudsperson or the respectful behavior committee consultation or filing complaint
we encourage consultation as first step
con su lt at ion any member of the society may inform the ombudsperson respectful behavior committee member or an asa trustee or officer about possible violation of the policy
if the incident has been reported to someone other than the ombudsperson that ers on will inform the ombudsperson
if the ombudsperson has conflict of interest or cannot for some other reason act in the matter they will select member of the respectful behavior committee to be the facilitator
the ombudsperson or facilitator will conduct an initial interview as soon as possible with the person or persons reported as the target of disrespectful behavior or harassment and determine what action that person or persons want taken if any
if endorsed as appropriate by both the ombudsperson and the person or per so ns targeted in violation of this policy the ombudsperson or facilitator will attempt to bring about an informal resolution
engaging in an informal resolution process does not remove the right to file complaint in the event that the informal process fa
if an informal resolution is obtained the ombudsperson will submit confidential report of the incident summary of findings and informal resolution to the asa officers
further their policy notes that the ombudsperson maintains involvement in the formal resolution process complaint must be made in writing and must be filed with the ombudsperson or with any officer or trustee of the asa no more than one year after the incident
the person journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on receiving the written complaint shall transmit it the earliest opportunity to the ombudsperson for investigation and shall maintain the confidentiality of the report
again the fact that the om buds takes part in the formal resolution processes indicates that it is not an organizational om buds but om eth ing different
while the most recent om buds holds the title of there is no reference to standards of practice related to the om buds profession specifically
as the om buds is member of the association and takes part in some facet of the disciplinary processes it is difficult to determine her level of independence and informality
from these descriptions it appears as though it serves as classical om buds
the latin me ric an studies association lasa recently adopted an anti harassment policy which affirms the commitment to ensuring environment free from all forms of discrimination harassment and and to an atmosphere that encourages the free expression and exchange of scholarly lasa anti harassment policy
the policy specifies the division of roles and responsibilities among the om buds the policy advisor trained staff member in the lasa secretariat and the anti harassment subcommittee of the lasa executive council
notably given the nature of this association each of the two om buds persons must have knowledge of either english and spanish or english and portuguese
the new code of conduct adopted by las incorporates discussion of the activities and importance of the om buds and reinforces the conclusion that the model adopted is the organizational om buds lasa
in september the american academy of religion established professional conduct procedures american academy of religion
as part of this procedure it outlined the establishment of an ombudsperson role
in the description within their policy the om buds persons are elected members who are charged with representing the interests of the membership by addressing complaints of violation of policies
as an organizational ombudsperson is to remain neutral and not represent the interests of either party the description outlined could be construed as classical om buds especially given their more formal role an ombudsperson apprises the executive director of the complaint and consults with the committee on professional conduct to determine whether complaint should be addressed through this policy or dismissed on the grounds that the allegations even if substantiated would not constitute violation of this policy or on other grounds as appropriate
the ombudsperson also consults with the committee on professional conduct to recommend the complaint to the committee on professional conduct for formal investigation or to pursue facilitating an informal resolution process as described herein professional conduct procedures adopted september effective january
this language seems to indicate that the om buds for the takes on more formal role in the complaint and investigation process
again there exists no reference to standard of practice or the training of the individual fulfilling the role
we thus classify this model as classical
journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on in december the association of jewish studies announced its appointment of three om buds to begin their om buds program in efforts to address sexual harassment and discrimination
from their web site om buds team members participate in annual training on the dynamics and patterns of sexual misconduct the policies and procedures for handling complaints of sexual misc on duct the importance of confidentiality fair process and impartiality and other related topics
om buds team members are the primary reporting members
their role is to help individuals and groups in the organization understand and make use of the options available to them by the procedures for resolving conflicts problematic issues or concerns
om buds team members listen and understand complaints maintain neutral impartial position with respect to the concerns raised help in divi duals understand and evaluate options informal and formal facilitate informal resolution processes archiving accommodation mediation and help individuals understand and access the formal resolution procedure
in addition om buds team members bring general systemic concerns to the attention of the organization for resolution
the description of their processes and establishment of the office appear to adhere to the standards of practice and code of ethics without explicitly stating so
in re vi ewing the formal resolution procedure other than providing guidance about the process the om buds do not have formal role in the disciplinary process
we note that from the web site it does not appear that any individuals in the role have had any forma training as an om buds association of jewish studies
summary through this review one can see that different patterns emerge in terms of type of program as well as scope of the work
this has implications for other om buds programs mo vi ng forward
first professional academic research associations in distinct disciplinary sectors differ in the types of om buds services provided as well as to whether they abide by widely used standards of practice or appropriate the term without it seems adhering to such standards
as table indicates om buds programs provided by associations in the natural sciences tend to lean towards those with classical model or are co opting the term for what actually is compliance function
save for the american economic association professional associations in the social sciences use the organizational om buds model
this inference is strengthened by the fact that number of the individuals selected to fulfill these om buds roles are also embers of the international ombudsman association
professional associations within arts and humanities exhibit diversity in that two seem to follow an organizational om buds model while three adopt more classical model or even compliance function which case we observe co opting of the use of the term

compliance rather than guaranteeing an independent and confidential resource individual ensures compliance with policies as well as with laws and regulations but does not adhere to any standards of practice as an om buds

organizational om buds adheres to the standards of practice of the
journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on second of the twenty om buds programs surveyed here the majority seem to have chosen an individual to serve as om buds from their own ranks
the experience and training of these individuals varies as it relates to om buds best practices
with the exception of few programs eg those in ae ra ap sa academy of management the individuals serving in om buds roles do not hold memberships in the international ombudsman association or related organizations for professional development in the classical model
this brings up the question of competency to work with individuals seeking assistance from the services as well as the ways in which the om buds interacts with the administration of the organization
third excepting three programs as tat sa sps and most om buds programs have sought out individuals either within their organization or with experience as an om buds to serve
as tat sa sp sp and have contracted with either dispute resolution firm or law firm to provide services
note that of those that have not contracted firm again the majority in this review have also selected an individual or individuals pursuing an active scholarly research agenda
relatedly we infer that the common practice of turning to an om buds who on ducts research in the relevant discipline reflects the conviction among the leaderships of the associations that knowledge of the norms practices and organizational contexts of these disciplines is important as well
the research backgrounds of these often center on ethics andor gender concerns
this is especially important as the scope of eleven out of the twenty associations directly connects to harassment and discrimination concerns only
in the remaining associations it appears that he om buds addresses the codes of conduct writ large
examining these trends within the review can speak to best practices for professional academic research associations on broader scale as well as shed light as to the ways in which the om buds role is impacted by the societal trends challenges within the organization as well as the individual practitioner fulfilling the role
standards of practice and the om buds role in its earliest conceptions in scandinavia the role was created to address and of government officials
as it was adopted in the united states and in other regions of the world the om buds role evolved to address concerns within organizations as well
as this process unfolded and the field professionalized by re ating professional associations for om buds various standards of practice and codes of ethics emerged to standardize the work of om buds
it is these professional om buds associations that have defined what work should be considered om buds work including classical advocate and organizational
standards of practice and codes of ethics have been the means that many professions have established the boundaries of and for their work as well as what is and is not ethical for their members to be performing
they provide an evaluation tool for om buds and their organizations to ensure proficiency protect visitors and the organizations themselves and safeguard the professionals developing their careers within the organizations
establishment of has been key component of defining profession wi lens ky
additionally from the earliest foundations in the united states these om buds were individuals considered of who could garner the respect and trust of the visitors whom they worked
without the requisite training in the organization and the work of an om buds as well as clear commitment to standards as outlined in the field of om buds work it seems that this notion of may be lost on many inst it ut ions working to create the om buds role
we differentiate three professional associations themselves using the acronym of asa
we denote the american statistical association as asta ta the american sociological association as as oca and the american society for aesthetics as asa esth
journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on unfortunately in recent years as concerns around harassment and discrimination have caught the media spotlight many organizations have seen the value in creating programs without recognizing that this term has history of practice including and buttressed by specific standards of practice and ethics behind it
that is to serve as an om buds is in fact profession
in many cases professional academic research associations create an pro gr am but in their description of the function what the om buds performs is truly compliance role which negates any of the benefits of genuine om buds program
this state of affairs further viol at es the rights of the members and em
while it is important for an om buds to have good working relationship with the compliance functions of an organization these are two distinct roles within conflict management system with unique histories and development
many of the at ions reviewed here seem to be committed to the right to protect the rights of their members and those who attend their professional conferences non members and members alike
it also seems however that many have not attended to the hist ory and standards already established for the role of om buds since the in the united states
the professional academic research associations have also created programs that do not adhere to any established standards by any recognized om buds associations
few of the associations provide training or membership in professional om buds associations for their members who fulfill these roles such training and membership of course would do much to help the om buds serving within professional acad emic research association better understand the meaning and responsibilities of an om buds
hence after reviewing these om buds programs in professional academic research associations as well the standards of practice and codes of ethics established by the american bar association and the international ombudsman association we provide some guidance as to best practices for an om buds program in professional academic research association
best practices for om buds in professional academic research assoc ia ti ons first it is valuable exercise to examine what can and cannot be classical advocate or organizational om buds model according to the american bar association
under the descriptions outlined by that association classical ombudsman the public sector addressing issues raised by the general public or internally usually concerning the actions or policies of government entities or
as the professional academic research associations are not in general public sector ag enc or government entities having their om buds adhere to the classical role does not protect the om buds in their role as they have not been established in way that enables them to adhere to the standards of practice outlined by the professional ions guiding these practices
additionally they do not have the authority to issue subpoenas nor have they been established by legislative body
if those in this study had modeled an advocate ombudsman they too would also not be following the his to ric al precedents for the creation of these spaces
according to the american bar association in this model this om buds as an advocate on behalf of population that is designated in the
given that they represent particular cons ti tu en cy depending on the language of the policy there may be conflicts of interest in how they were formed
finally note that some associations in this study have created offices that are really compliance offices and not an om buds office at all
compliance officer is someone who ensures that the association complies with outside regulatory and legal requirements as well as internal policies and by laws
they have duty to work with the leadership team and identify and manage risk
these posit ions are developed to help the association avoid missteps and legal journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on action
individuals working in compliance capacity while they may be independent in some instances are not impartial are not always confidential and do not form part of an informal process
thus if the professional research associations genuinely want to commit to creating truly unbiased impartial and independent office the organizational ombudsman model rises as the best model to address their concerns
organizational uds man facilitates fair and equitable resolutions of concerns that arise within the aba
further the primary duties of an organizational ombudsman are to work with individuals and groups in an organization to explore and assist them in determining options to help resolve conflicts problematic issues or concerns and to bring systemic concerns to the attention of the organization for resolution io ab
in our view the organizational model is especially appropriate for prof es sion al academic research associations in that it separates the om buds as an independent impartial neutral and confidential resource from the processes of investigation and potential imposition of sanctions
in professional academic research at ion in particular such separation is vital for it guarantees confidentiality and anonymity for all individuals seeking fair treatment in association policy and processes
given the nature of the work of an om buds office in professional academic research association one element of the institutional design that seems important is to have two person team in place as the om buds persons with professional full time om buds serving alongside an om buds who has some om buds train ing but who has spent the career as professional academic the relevant disciplinary research association
the professional om buds could share some of their experience with the non professional one and in return learn something from the ac ad emic team member of the history standard operating procedures structures and norms of the professional association
the academic om buds could enroll in the with all the benefits that entails and could self train with materials
it is useful to expand briefly on the preparation and self training of the academic mem be of the coom buds team
membership in the enables the academic om buds to learn about the om buds in range of ways such as reading the and taking web in ars in light of such benefits the professional research association might pay for member ship on behalf of the academic om buds
the professional om buds could guide the academic om buds by for example providing curat ed bibliography of readings
ideally the scholar recruited as the academic om buds would be able to reflect on long experience in serving mentor both in and out of formal mentorship programs
the academic om buds would also ideally be able to draw on participation in months long leadership program featuring classes on such topics as difficult conversations conflict re solutio and practices of kindness compassion and ethical behavior cf
as more professional research associations adopt an om buds office and in particular coom buds design adhering to the organizational om buds model adherence to standard training pro ce dures would seem to be important as ways to provide complementarity within the om buds team
another key element of the institutional design of the om buds in professional academic research associations the revision and if needed cre ati on of multiple policies so as to ensure policy foundation underpinning the work of the om buds
to illustrate when ap sa introduced its two co om buds it revised its code of ethics revised the rules on its ethics committee and created both an anti haras policy and sexual harassment committee
within year of the establishment of the om buds ap sa launched its respect campaign designed to buttress respectful quit able professional ethical conduct towards all
in addition ap sa initiated multi pl bystander intervention trainings during the annual meetings
all of these policies and programs support and reinforce the activities of the om buds program
journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on the benefits of the organizational om buds for professional academic research association parti ally resemble those found in university and corporate settings
for example any visitor to an office benefits from the organizational explanations of options under the policy of the association or university or company should the in divi dual wish to make complaint or report the existence of problem
moreover at meeting of professional academic research association the organizational om buds brings benefits that go beyond those characteristics seen in universities colleges and corporations
educational institutions and work places feature ongoing structured interactions with people who know each other over time
the conference of professional academic research association presents stark contrast with such setting
over the span of just few days the thousands of attendees at conference navigate hectic schedule of panels round tables exhibit halls one on one meetings dinners receptions and the like held across multiple hotels
all attendees must deal with the hubbub and junior colleagues in particular face the unfamiliar including for some involvement in job market activities
in this setting the om buds offers trusted resource willing ear and sounding board within the professional association when part ic at meeting encounter sexual harassment face discrimination or have another concern
om buds offices in colleges and universities offer what might be called channels for addressing concerns
om buds resources in professional associations address problems so as to support initiatives wherever the members and other participants in the professional activities are employed
in addition the associational om buds operates in what might otherwise be termed
to clarify an attendee at professional meeting has no recourse when she or he wishes to consult confidential trusted resource save in the unlikely scenario in which both or all of the individuals involved in complaint are employed at he same institution
the associational om buds meets this need for attendees employed by different institutions and joined by their common participation in the same professional meeting under the same policies of the same professional academic research ass oc ia ti on
as the organizational om buds in university or corporate setting works to reinforce messages from the university and the employer that certain types of behavior are not tolerated so the associational om buds works to create and sustain an en vi ro in which all members of research community are valued and respected in accordance with the norms of the scholarly community
the om buds serves to establish more equitable respectful and inclusive climate and simply safer climate for all at the professional meetings
the benefits of the organizational om buds in professional academic research associations are clear
yet challenges arise from the nature of professional conference just sketched
attendees during con fer en ce and members during the academic year may hesitate to turn to the om buds given the newness of the resources and thus their limited familiarity with it
even if attendees have some sense of what the om buds does they may rush from one event to er during the conference with no time to reflect or to consult the om buds
after the conference has ended even if attendees intend to follow up with the associational om buds they may not do so as past events appear to become less urgent
another chal le facing attendees who might contemplate using the om buds resource is the disempower ing effect of bullying and intimidation
some attendees at professional conference may have no om buds at their home institution or if one exists they may not know of the on campus om buds
for such individuals the need at the meeting is simply to have someone listen
the challenge also brings benefits even when the om buds cannot directly assist the attendee at the meeting attendees feel valued and heard which streng thens community norms
as still another challenge if institutions use the organizational om buds model then if the professional association uses different model it could instill distrust in one or both om buds offices as well as create con fu sion as to processes
this observation points to another some attendees potentially interested in consulting the om buds might misunderstand what the om buds can and cannot do perhaps because of familiarity at their journal of the international ombudsman association burton mer sh on home institution with an om buds office ol lowing another model than that used in the professional association
for example an attendee might expect the organizational om buds to make decisions for given individual not knowing that any decision to be made is up to the individual involved
conc lu si ons what are the implications of this discussion
first the om buds resource is of clear importance for professional academic research associations
one sign of its value to associations indeed is the diffusion of the resource which has clearly acce le rated in the last few years
second observe the pattern in the models of om buds adopted
in some professional academic research associations individuals take on the name om buds persons but perform compliance functions
this model might be seen as most distant from the organizational om buds model
in other associations the classical om buds model can be observed
indeed the classical model is the second most common om buds model used in professional academic research associations
still other profession al associations as seen adopt the organizational om buds model
the largest number of associations reviewed here have followed the organizational model
however without clear standards of practice both domestic and international members may have ng expectations of the om buds role and the scope of the om buds ability to assist
one overall implication of this article is that the somewhat distinct perspectives of individuals with differing professional backgrounds serving as om buds can be helpful to the professional association
in particular we find useful the resource to two member team of co om buds made up of professional full time om buds and an om buds who is not professional om buds but who serves the association as full time member of he discipline pursuing an active scholarly agenda that in some way brings her or him to explore questions of for example race ethnicity sexual identity discrimination and steps to redress harassment
if non professional om buds is to serve along si de professional om buds or as solo om buds in the association we believe it important that the non professional om buds be enrolled in the and benefit from some training in om buds ethics stand ar ds of practice and common challenges
we note that in especially large professional associations an example is the ae ra routinely drawing attendees the work of single om buds would be onerous indeed compacted as it would be in relatively brief span of time
additionally careful consideration should be given as to the unique challenges for the professional academic research association as to whether their om buds serve for only the duration of the meeting or beyond especially if concerns extend beyond the time frame of the meeting
co om buds eam combining the two professional profiles we depict would together shoulder responsibilities so as to share activities confer on challenging cases and avoid compassion fatigue
to close circle opened at the outset many professional re sear ch associations have created om buds offices to address harassment discrimination and intimidation
while an admirable start we would urge professional associations to consider expanding their om buds programs beyond harassment discrimination and int imi dation as such issues often have blurry boundaries crossing over into infractions or violations of the code of professional ethics

acknow ld eg men ts the author is grateful to the journal of the international om buds mans association for providing copy of case for kindness new look at the teaching ethic for this review
journal of the international ombudsman association step hens om buds persons may feel that we must walk careful line between kindness and rational process
as college instructor of nearly thirty years can attest that the same is often true for teachers and perhaps for similar reasons
in case for kindness new look at the teaching ethic steve lays out rationale for balancing these seemingly competing interests and makes recommendations that in many ways may be useful for us as practicing om buds
in this review will comment on broid ideas and apply them to our role as organizational om buds
begins by examining and distilling the usage history of the term kindness and its relationship to education
he notes that while learning is the goal of teaching the teacher student relationship is the medium in which learning occurs
kindness as discovers is key aspect of the teacher student relationship
something similar might be said for the work of an om buds that conflict resolution of various sort might be the goal but the medium through which that goal is achieved is the om buds visitor relationship and kindness as defined by is key aspect of that relationship
goes on to explore the historically vague and poorly defined nature of kindness examining the various ways in which it has been characterized and its relationship to educational history in general
he notes for example that kindness has often been conflated with related but nonsynonymous terms su ch as beneficence benevolence mercy empathy and goodness
he then draws upon those ideas and the logic inherent in them to develop concept description of kindness that is useful to teaching and om buds ethic
he defines kin dn ess orientation as involving continuing sensitivity to some need emotions feelings in response to that need that may variously be ones of determination to help have compassion andor have empathy disposition to take action to mitigate the need with regard to the welfare of others affected by the actions and reasoned priority of doing so
further for such sensibility to result in actions that are recognizable as kind the one acting must have and deploy relevant knowledge and skill needed to mitigate the need
relatedly notes that teaching ethic that focuses primarily on individual welfare but in the context of groups affected by an ethical est both individual students and the larger community
would suggest that the same is true for an om buds ethic and our visitors
in determining how best to assist visitor we must consider both the needs of the visitor and of the larger community or institution in which the visitor is embedded
much as suggests for teachers om buds must not only be skillful in practice but must also be guided by strong ethical values driven stance where kindness is part of the values system
ethics and values without skill makes one ineffectual as an om buds and skill without values simply leads one to become as cs lewis argued
if kindness should be one of those core values then how to develop it ately becomes key question
again makes recommendations for the teaching profession that seem to easily translate for om buds
for me several thoughts emerge from recommendations that seem particularly useful to om buds
develop practice of regular self reflection leading to higher awareness
the more aware we are the more intense will be our emotional experience and the more likely we will be to extend ourselves in kindness to another
the more intense our emotional experiences the higher the risk of emotional fatigue and its challenges for those involved in emotional work
journal of the international ombudsman association step hens
om buds might best be served by coaches who are themselves om buds who practice with kindness oriented om buds ethic
to that end regular conversations with other om buds about particularly challenging experiences that may arise in our om buds practices professional gathering with opportunities for skill building such as the annual meetings and trainings and other such formal or informal connections would be helpful
similarly adapted from recommendations as we set up om buds policies procedures and struct ur es within our organizations we should consider how best to adopt om buds administrative and technological practices that will support kindness oriented om buds ethic
for example on occasion have taken advantage of nearby lands caped gardens to suggest and with visitors who seem nervous about meeting in the more formal atmosphere of an office
in my experience such walk and talks can help visitor relax enough to discuss their concerns fully and openly
problem bas ed learning woods within local or broader om buds community may also be beneficial
for example after completing an extensive first aid training course several years ago now receive monthly newsletter that includes would you scenario drawn from real life experience and contributed by trained practitioner
this allows me to virtually practice the skills received at the training and explore how might meet that need
as om buds we can offer similar ho ug ht exercises with colleagues whether within our own organizations or more broadly in our profession
in similar settings have been part of groups where individual om buds raised real challenges they have faced in working with visitors described ho they handled them or proposed to and then invited thoughts and ideas from the group
suggestions and insights such as how to calm frustrated visitor or how to better support visitor in taking needed action have proven beneficial
all visitors co me with perceived needs most of which are grounded in reality
to act kindly much like recommends to teachers an om buds must recognize those need in their visitors
for that visitor to recognize the ensuing actions as kind the visitor must also see and acknowledge that need
this presents several challenges and opportunities to the om buds
first there is the practical problem of determining when need is real that is does the perceived need represent something that should be addressed
second not all perceived needs directly concern the situation for which the visitor came to the om buds they may represent future needs or present needs only tangentially related to the present situation
likewise the need felt by the visitor may from the broader perspective of the om buds not represent the need of the visitor
finally any need held by visitor may not be solely their problem
being em bedded in broader organization or community means resolution of that need will likely involve others to greater or lesser degree
the need on the part of the om buds for humility to recognize they likely do not have all the answers to ask careful que st ions to better understand and help the visitor understand and to work with patience and forbearance all seem crucial to really helping the visitor achieve the best possible solution to their problem
concludes case for kindness by arguing th at he has made case for kindness as the central focus for teaching relationships
likewise believe that case can be made for kindness as central factor in successful om buds work
quotes john dewey the american phi lo sopher and educational reformer others instead of being form of charity which impoverishes the recipient is simply an aid in setting free the powers and furthering the impulse of the one helped dewey
can think of no more ideal out come for our work as om buds than to achieve this same goal
one visitor at time we can strive not only to help them resolve their immediate difficulty but to become more knowledgeable and capable thus making our services unnecessary to them in their utu re challenges
to that end and despite it journal of the international ombudsman association step hens being embedded in different profession reading case for kindness would be well worth the time spent by any om buds

methodology practice standardization journal of the international ombudsman association wong mark book make an ethical difference tools for better action is an easy to read easy touse resource that gives practical guidance on how to sharpen ability to find ethical solutions past in
past in shares his experience and expertise from over forty years of giving ethical advice to organizations worldwide and several branches of the united states government
the book is suitable for those interested in sharpening their ability to find ethical solutions in their daily and professional lives
as past in maintains everyone has an innate ethics sense or what he calls ethics which can be honed towards finding ethical solutions or is
those who approach their reading wi th the view to learn will likely gain confidence in their conflict resolution skills in diverse situations and in their daily practice in handful of ways
the book also holds strong implications for the ombudsman profession
strongest contrib ut ion to his readers is well defined methodology that consists of two categories
the first category introduces five tools for sharpening own ethics sense
past in identifies each tool the ground backward to find the the in the and global benefit
the second category consists of four steps for achieving with others the ethical agreement that past in calls convergence
the convergence process uses the same five spread across the four steps with some tools in combination as in step
these steps are the the ground the and using global benefits and in the
both cate go ries are interdependent with one another
specifically an improved ethics sense can sharpen ability to achieve ethical agreement with others and vice versa
used together both sets have significant implications for standardizing the ombudsman ct ice
the practitioner will likely find methodology easy to apply because each of the five tools he offers is straightforward and practical and each will contribute to sharpening ethics sense
first the ground is about id en ti fy ing and understanding the broad principles that parties use to determine their actions
these rules only be breached under extreme
thus past in reasons that by uncovering the ground rules one can understand actions
sec backward to find the encourages identifying possible outcomes and linking them back to find the interests they serve
as past in states interests are often the key to resolving ethical
third the fact is about solving factual disagreements
this tool requires facts to be grasped well and understood in the context of the ground rules and interests
when using this tool past in especially recommends identifying and evaluating contested facts
he define contested facts as facts that the parties disagree are fundamental to the matter
to evaluate these facts one decides if agreeing would change their perspective on what ethical
if the answer is past in suggests that that contested fact is important to finding solution
past in further notes that measure of success can be found if adding more facts no longer changes sense of what is ethical
fourth in the helps to humanize opposing sides
to use this tool past in encourages identifying the potentially affected parties especially those with whom one finds the most disagreement
it is then important to reduce the distance between parties by meeting and learning each other
past in reasons that doing so increases sympathy and empathy and lessens indifference on both sides
moreover being able to record and revise the ground rules and interests while verifying and rejecting each rule and inter est helps sharpen understanding of the issue and the ethics eye
fifth global benefit helps to raise questions that can help one find the course of action that will produce the balance of benefit over harm for all wit ho ut violating important ground rules
all five tools help to sharpen the ethics eye from an intrapersonal standpoint to guide oneself with confidence towards choosing the ethical course of action
by contrast the four step convergence process oc uses on developing the ethics eye from an interpersonal level because the steps help achieve ethical agreement with others
moreover while individuals can pursue the process on their own past in notes that reaching an ethical journal of the international ombudsman association wong agreement becomes likelier when more parties in the situation participate in this process
the steps apply the first tools but past in adds nuances in how they are used
there past in encourages parties to decide on method for sett ling the facts if the parties cannot agree on what the facts are before applying the the tool itself
similarly in the ground past in adds that parties should focus on where their ground rules agree before resolving thos upon which they disagree
step is the only step that combines tools
it specifically highlights how global benefit complements the by ensuring coverage of interests
in step moreover past in how applying in the especially to those affected makes focus more specific
by following this stepwise approach one can align with what opposing parties see as the right course of action
for the ombudsman the intrap ers on al and interpersonal aspects of two part methodology have the potential to serve three purposes that contribute to more standardized practice overall
first there is pedagogical value to methodology for training other ombudsman prof es sion als and improving their skills
second his systematic approach can serve as checklist for record keeping and consistency of practice for quality assurance purposes
third and perhaps most fundamental is that methodology generates self awareness and confidence in practitioners about what they do and how they do it
the tools and steps are logical
the eleven situations past in interweaves throughout the chapters although somewhat distractively to show how each tool applies helps to draw this conclusion
regardless of background one will likely find similarities between own approach and and may even gather some form of the process he offers
however others may likely realize how much they rely on their intuition at her than on defined and laid out system which they can clearly articulate themselves
this is where past in does the legwork
he recognizes the reliance on an innate desire and ability to do what is right but addresses the need for well defined tools th at can articulate and raise awareness therefore confidence to act how and what people do to achieve ethical solutions
he raises awareness by articulating what the tools and steps are specifically
the result is sharpened ethics sense for the individual practitioner
if shared increasingly among practitioners the potential is sharpened ethics sense in the collective consciousness of the ombudsman profession that is bound by shared knowledge of the tools and steps at the practitioner disp os al

cultural dynamics in sexual harassment case

the case that changed almost everything journal of the international mb uds man association si
voice rises against sexism what did he say
asked in follow up phone conversation with an undergraduate student who had recently complained to her departmental chair about inappropriate sexual comments ade to her by one of her professors
she paused for second before answering
could hear her draw breath in and with mixture of both anger and trembling in her voice she said told the chair what the professor had said and done to make me feel uncomfortable the chair said at least he has good taste
think in my life have ever done this before but did my first face palm when hearing that response
about week or so prior to this conversation the student had ap pr the om buds office
she was afraid to talk because she did not want anyone knowing about the situation
explained our principle of confidentiality and that our office was not mandated reporter and so what this meant was that unless there was hr eat of harm to someone we did not have responsibility to report anything
up until this point in the conversation did not know the nature of the issue but her discomfort was obvious
reiterated that my focus was on providing space for people to decide what to do in their situations and that there to judge or blame anyone
often mention that not there to attribute blame because not my role and perhaps more important being judgmental help the person reaching out
she seemed to relax bit more but she sharing yet
over the years concluded that many individuals experiencing sexual harassment sometimes blame themselves and are afraid others will judge them and grill them for example what they were wear in whether they were drinking whether they had been flirting whether there had been prior intimate romantic or sexual relationship with the person
am aware as an om buds that any individual contacting us might have sexual harassment issue and such know to be sensitive as to what say how say it and how invite the individual to trust in me
it lost on me either that inhabited male body and she was female
my intuition told me that she yet comfortable with me or the office and if this was indeed sexual harassment issue she might not at all be comfortable sharing her problem with me
since my om buds office does not have om buds of different genders orientations and races in this moment all could do to make her comfortable was to rely on my words and sincerity
explained to the visitor that she have to provide names or details of what happened and that she would only be listed on our intake sheet as
reiterated my invitation about her needing to share information to the extent she felt comfortable sharing
this seemed to alleviate her hesitation in talking with me
by then hoped she felt that she was in charge of the conversation and this was her story to tell
when story pours out it always clear if it is going to be short concise and linear or whether it will weave in and out
she shared her excitement about the opportunity to learn from this professor whom she had looked up and wondered in retrospect whether she had led him on in some way
she felt guilty that she spoken up initially when his comments and looks began
she had approached him during office hours when there was no one else to witness what had hap pe ne so she wondered if maybe she was to blame
the professor told her that he wished he was younger because she was and he would have been willing to take that risk if he were younger
she respond to this first comment
she thought perhaps she overreacted in her mind she exp la in ed
the second time she went to office hours she was wearing red sweater
he looked her up and down and told her she should wear red more often because it went with her blonde hair
she worried that this journal of the international mb uds man association si comment was her fault her sweater was tight fitting and red did make her more noticeable
she told me repeatedly that the situation had not felt right
uncomfortable moments would happen and then quickly everything would be professional again
the final straw was the last visit she had with him
as he was leaving the meeting with her back to him he patted her on the shoulder
and then stroke on her shoulder
she did not turn around did not say anything just left
and now she know what to do
we talked about the situation and shared information about policies that might apply
here shared the sexual harassment policy
part of the definition is that the behavior the sexual advance needs to be
she felt bad that she expressed to the professor her discomfort
we al ked about her options
asked what she thought about approaching the professor and communicating what she had experienced
asked whether she wanted me to facilitate conversation
suggested she could draft letter to the harasser in which she coul explain her discomfort ask for the behavior to stop and articulate what she expected in future interactions
none of these ideas resonated with her
as we talked it became clear that one of the power dynamics he professor and she student made her believe that he going to voluntarily change
she felt that he needed to be held accountable so we talked about her ability to report the situation to the title ix director
in the united states title ix of the educational amendments of et seq refers to the law that protects people from discrimination based on sex in educational programs that receive federal financial assistance
reiterated that our om buds office was not an office of notice and as such we would not re po rt her situation to the university
she want to become embroiled in an investigation so we explored the idea of her approaching administration to talk about the situation
there was still the possibility that administration the department chair in this case might report the situation to the title ix director but she was willing to take that risk
and so initially she left the om buds office with plan
she felt better and optimistic that perhaps if the department chair someone with some author talked to the professor he would just stop
her optimism was gone number of days later as she updated me during our phone conversation
least he had good she repeated
these were the words the departmental chair had uttered when she had confided in him her experience
so the student and talked some more
she want this happening to others
she now as concerned about her grade she would demand someone else grade he exams and projects
and so she did not hesitate to report the situation to the title ix director
last heard from her she was happy with the outcome
semester or so later learned that this specific department had professors that going decade back reportedly hosted parties where the lines between faculty and students were often blurred
the parties had stopped years ago but apparently the culture within the department was still questionable and sadly this situation was one of ma ny indicative of systemic problem
was never sure if this particular decision to make report caused the department to became more accountable but certain her situation made the institution take note
since mary ro we has recommended offering to targets of sexual harassment the option of drafting letter to the perpetrator as possible way of helping offended individuals to prepare for and choose the next steps tha seem right to them
ideas to consider if you have been harassed
publication document id journal of the international mb uds man association si looking back at the situation wh at learned as an om buds is that sometimes those who have the power to hold others accountable effectively execute their responsibility and might even need to be held accountable themselves
additionally saw how the confidential non judgmental space created by an om buds office can help visitors find courage when the system has initially failed them
witnessed shift in my visitor from someone who was dis empowered and questioning whether she had done anything wrong to more em pow er ed individual who was angry and in that emotion found the motivation to resist her injustice
supporting considered response to harassing behaviour the me too movement has had far reaching impact providing much lear er understanding of sexual harassment in the workplace as well as highlighting the complexity of this issue
in this narrative explore the role of the om buds in supporting young female staff member whom shall call mary as she tries to respond thoughtfully to the unwanted attention of senior male colleague whilst navigating her way through some of these complexities
by way of background am an om buds in an organisation of less than five thousand employees
practice according to the standards of practice and whilst am not subject to statutory mandatory reporting requirements in my jurisdiction it is policy that the head of the organisation is made aware of all formal sexual harassment complaints
over the last couple of years my organisation has been active in improving its response to allegations of sexual harassment by reviewing policies and procedures strengthening formal processes and raising awareness internally about the issue
there is what would describe as cautious op tim ism as well as realistic appreciation that significant work still needs to be done to improve the experience of victims who want to raise concerns about sexual harassment
mary approached the om buds office at the beginning of the year to discuss con about senior male manager who was not her direct line manager but someone whose work closely intersects with the work of her team
she explained that at work christmas party she found herself in long social conversation with the manager
she detailed that the conversation included them both talking in some depth about aspects of their personal lives
mary indicated that she had reflected great deal upon the nature of the conversation and was disappointed in herself describing herself as for not picking up on the cues concerning the of aspects of the conversation
she further thought that she should have realised the potential for the conversation to be misinterpreted by her male colleague
since the christ ma party the senior manager displayed significant unwanted attention towards mary both in the work environment and in attempts to meet with her outside of work
she detailed work meetings which the senior manager attended but which were only marginally related to his responsibilities
she further described how the manager would direct all his work related queries through her even though there are more appropriate people to direct his queries to
because mary is the most junior member of the team all her colleagues have more seniority and experience than her
mary further detailed attempts by the manager to schedule meetings with her to talk about related matters or to initiate small projects that they could work together on
the manager was also turning up in different areas of the workplace the tea room and the cafeteria attempting to strike up social conversation
this behaviour ha spilled over to outside of work with the journal of the international mb uds man association si manager attempting to initiate dialogue through social me di accounts as well as inviting her to meet up outside of work hours
as mary became increasingly uncomfortable about the situation she described her attempts to try to avoid being in situations alone with the manager as well as politely declining his ff ers to socialize
as the behaviour continued mary reported that she spoke more directly with him advising him that she was not interested in anything other than professional relationship that she only wanted to relate to him about work rel ated matters and that she wanted him to cease contacting her outside of work
following that more direct conversation mary received an invitation from the manager to meet up outside of work to discuss these matters further
it was at this point that she approached the om buds office frustrated and upset that the manager was not listening to her and very uncomfortable that these behaviours appeared to be escalating
mary advised the om buds that she felt anxious trapped alone and confused about what do next
she explained that she had to be particularly careful about who she discussed this with as the manager was experienced and well connected whereas she was junior inexperienced and had only small network of connections
she wanted to be reassured that the om buds understood her predicament and that the office would treat issues of confidentiality seriously
my approach at the beginning was to focus upon listening to mary empathically and without judgement
endeavoured to create safe and respectful environment where she felt that someone understood her experience could connect with her feelings and treated her concerns seriously
wanted to create an environment that enabled mary to tell her story in er words
was also very mindful to understand and explore the impact that this was having upon mary
am aware that victims often present in high state of distress and that responding to their emotional needs at the outset helps them to settle and enables them to tell their story in thoughtful and considered way
was also conscious of ensuring that mary had adequate resources both professional and personal to manage the emotional impact upon her
one of the dynamics am aware of in sexual ha ra ss ment matters is where victim feels responsible for what has occurred
when mary described herself as and berated herself for not realising in the moment what was occurring with the manager gently supported her to reflect upon the power di ff er en ti al and her description of him as an experienced senior colleague manager husband and father
wanted her to think about the fact that each of these roles conveyed range of responsibilities for him
mary was further frustrated with her self believing that it was failure on her part that she could not get the senior manager to stop his pursuing behaviour
she also tried to take responsibility for the fact that the situation appeared to be escalating
encouraged her to think about wha was in her control emphasising that she had taken assertive action to make her wishes clear and that she was limited in what she could do if the manager was not open to listening to her
mary was confused lacking in confidence and apprehensive about what to do next
at this point engaged with her around the options open to her
was aware of the importance of not only ensuring that she felt in control of the direction that she wished to take this matter but also that she had realistic understand ing of the pathways for resolution
to ensure this explained to her that at times the rhetoric and good intentions did not match the reality of the experience of people particularly for those who decided to use the formal complaint mech an isms
journal of the international mb uds man association si explored with mary the option of making formal complaint in some depth including what the process entailed how it works generally and how it might work given the issues that she wanted to raise
this exploration included consideration of su btl issues around power and influence including the seniority and connections and significant concerns about the potential impact upon her work life and longer term career
from the outset mary was very clear that she did not want human involved nor did she want to make formal complaint
part of the reason for this was that she did not want the head of the organisation to be aware of her concerns
nor did she want to damage the career or undermine his personal re lati on ships
her desired outcome was that the manager would listen to her and stop the unwanted attention
explored with mary some informal pathways that may enable her to reach that outcome including whether and how she could communicate further with the manager or begin discussion with more senior manager
also discussed the role that the om buds could play in either talking directly with the manager or with more senior management
while took some time to explain how would approach direct conversation with either the manager or his superior mary was of the strong view that direct intervention by the om buds had an undesirable potential to escalate matters
she held this view because while the om buds office is informal it has stand ing in the organisation as an office of some importance and any om buds intervention was treated seriously
whilst respected concern and her assessment in relation to this issue would probably have explored her concerns in greater depth if the circumstances of the harassment that mary had experienced had been different
mary decided that the option that she felt most comfortable with was to send strongly worded email to the manager
she also wanted to develop strategies to confidently respond to him if she did find herself alone with him or if her work called for her to be in close proximity with him on tasks
felt that this was considered realistic and proportionate response
assisted mary to draft an email that detailed clear bound aries around work roles including emphasising again that she did not intend to have any contact with the manager outside of the work environment
the email also suggested that if there was any aspect that the manager was unclear about she would be com for table to have clarifying conversation about this facilitated by the om buds office
whilst mary did not expect that the manager would take up the offer of the clarifying conversation she wanted him to know that she was serious about her concerns and that she was prepared to escalate the matter if his behaviour continued
raised with mary the possibility that the manager might get angry about including the option of engaging the om buds office in her email however she did not believe that this would cc ur
indeed she thought that mentioning the om buds office in this way would convey to the manager that she was aware of the office and prepared to use it should the behaviour continue
she thought it would also imply that she may have already consulted the om buds office and more generally that it would convey to the manager the importance of responding constructively to her concerns
further coached mary and undertook role pays to build her confidence about how she might respond to situations where she came in close contact with the manager
following these role plays she indicated that she felt more confident to be able to respond in measured thoughtful and more assertive way should this occur
followed up with mary two month later and at that time she was happy with the outcome of the intervention
she reported that she had not heard further from the manager and that she felt the journal of the international mb uds man association si strategies that she had implemented had worked
believed that the om buds intervention had been successful and was comfortable enough to close the case
more recently mary revisited the om buds office anxious that vacancy for manager had arisen in her work group for which the senior manager was eligible to apply
she was concerned that if he id apply and was successful that this would have significant impact upon her safety wellbeing and career
despite what thought was good initial outcome return brought home to me the fact that informally intervening in sexual harassment mat te rs can leave victim vulnerable to further unwelcomed behaviour
consistent with my initial approach spent time listening to concerns acknowledging her fears and supporting her to think about her options
the options open to her were the sa me as when she first presented including formally or informally taking her concerns further with the support of the om buds office
some important new issues for her to consider were the fact that the manager had respected her last communication with him and that there were number of unknowns in relation to whether the manager was actually interested enough to apply for the role
should he put in an application then he would be required to go through merit based interview process in which he may not successful
during these discussions understood that an important part of my role was creating containing environment to enable mary to sit with the tension and anxiety of the current situation and to think clearly about this new set of circum st anc es
all throughout this time was conscious about what her response to this situation told me about her anxiety state and of the importance of ensuring that she had adequate resources and support from outside of the office to support her in managing her
mary was able to think clearly about the various scenarios and her options to respond to them
the containing environment enabled her to decide to wait to find out whether in fact the manager applies for the position and that even if he does to wait upon the outcome of the recruitment process
should the manager end up in the role then mary and agreed that we would meet again to consider her options
part of the complexity in matter related to the nature of the harassment that occurred
much of the behaviour was nuanced and could be denied deflected and defended through the current bureaucratic and legalistic processes
should she have made formal complaint and the harassment was found to have occurred it realistically would not ha been found to be behaviour that would result in the dismissal of the manager
for mary this would probably mean that formal complaint would result in pyrrhic victory leaving her to try to continue her career working near the manager against whom she had made formal complaint
this would be very uncomfortable and have left her incredibly vulnerable
to make an informed decision about different courses of action victims deserve not only realistic understanding of how formal processes operate bu also an awareness of what some of the research tells us about the experience of people who initiate formal complaint about sexual harassment
the complexity of providing this type of information is that those who are responsible for formal complaint pr oc esses might consider that these conversations discourage the making of formal complaint
visitors might also believe that the om buds is discouraging them from making formal complaint
understand how these beliefs can arise and believe that this peaks to the tension for om buds between the desire for justice anger about the abuse of power and the need to protect victims from the complex challenging and imperfect system
whilst believe that formal complaint processes are an important part of comprehensive organisational response to sexual journal of the international mb uds man association si harassment they are not constructive option for many situations that visitors present with
given this the approach to ensuring informed consent prior to victim undertaking formal complaint process be approached thoughtfully and with these risks and tensions in mind
if the visitor chooses to take formal action there is critical role for the om buds to not only promote due process but to ensure that victims are protected from negative cons associated with exercising their rights including retribution and reputation al damage
these are significant challenges for om buds to consider when supporting considered response to allegations of harassing behaviour
when the end is not the end can easily recall over dozen title ix related cases that have dealt with since coming to the university that currently employs me
it is large public institution and my charter with the university allows me to practice under the standards of the international ombudsman association
am exempt from being mandated reporter based on my title ix policy
have been visited by alleged victims who were reluctant to rep or for fear of retaliation those who wanted to understand the extent to which formal investigation would be intrusive and others whose relationships were at some point consensual and they feared that there may be repercussions for that
most of my title ix related cases however have come from those responding to allegations
many of them felt that the investigation process was unfair
some were provisionally sanctioned no trespass order removal from all or some part of campus etc
and felt that was unfair since they had not yet been provided due process
many respondents felt that investigators and other university personnel were too quick to believe the alleged victim
while most of the respondents who visited my office were men responding to the allegations of women have also met with male visitor who was responding to another male allegations of sexual assault and one male who complained that female student was harassing him
my institution is very diverse but most of the visit ors who have come to my office with title ix related cases were white
can think of three who were of color and two who were international students
there was one particular case where felt most helpful in my role as om buds
because believe it allo wed me to engage directly in way that was especially effective as an om buds chose that one for this narrative
graduate student scheduled an appointment to see me about an issue he was experiencing with his program
when he arrived shared my op en ing statement to be sure he understood the confidential and informal nature of our meeting and then he began telling his story
he was in small academic program and he had been accused of sexually harassing and assaulting another student with whom he had once lived
the formal investigation which took months to complete had been grueling for him
he was issued no contact order and was forced to stop taking courses while investigators looked into the allegations
he was clearly still quite affected by the allegations and he assured me again and again that he had not done anything wrong
while the investigation was underway he lost weight sought mental health counseling and spent thousands of dollars seeking legal help
because of the size and na tu re of the academic department faculty and other students were well aware of the allegations and many of them had taken sides with one student or the other
emotions were highly charged lines were drawn and relationships across the department were dam aged
journal of the international mb uds man association si eventually the investigators determined that there was not enough evidence to support the allegations and my visitor was cleared of fault
he was grateful for that for those who conducted the process and he looked forward to returning to cl as and completing his degree
the outcome released the no contact order which likely was not concern for the alleged victim since during the time of the investigation she had graduated from the program
once the title ix office issued its findings my visitor was cleared to return to his program
the first event he attended was and where many of the students and faculty met in one room to listen to guest speaker
my visitor told me that he was very nervous about returning but he was also eager to move forward
as he sat in my office he described the palpable discomfort he experienced when he walked into that room
soon after senior administrator from his academic program wrote him an email and told him that he should not return to campus except to meet with his faculty advisor and that when he did decide to return to campus he should let that administrator know
the administrator noted that the presence on campus was unsettling to many and hat their role as an organizational leader was to make sure others felt safe
one of the junior faculty members learned of the communication and suggested the student visit my office
as an om buds it really was fascinating place to be engaged
because of the informal nature of my office there would have been little could do while the investigation was taking place however at the time of his visit there was no formal process underway
was able to simply listen for long long time and then him understand next steps
it became clear throughout my conversations with him that his desired outcome was to complete his academic program and restore the trust of his colleagues and faculty
while spent many hours coaching him through the lat te there were immediate actions that could be taken to address the former
asked him if he was comfortable asking the title ix investigator about any lingering sanctions but he shuddered at the idea of engaging with that official again
he asked if would be willing to ask on his behalf
reminded him of the informal nature of my role do not want visitors to assume can intervene and their problems in this role
ultimately agreed to call my colleague in that office to find out if there we re any restrictions on his engaging with the university
of course in asking the title ix officer about the outcomes associated with his case revealed my involvement
the officer and had already established positive working relationship so they expressed neither surprise nor offense in response to my questions
the officer confirmed that the case had been closed and all provisional sanctions had been lifted
the student was free to resume his normal activities
during follow up visit inform ed my visitor that the university had placed no restriction on his ability to engage and that if he were further sanctioned for any reason he would once again receive due process
he wanted me to explicitly say the senior administrator was wrong and that he was permitted to visit campus at any time
instead of confirming his suggestion which could have sabotaged the trust of university leadership and compromised my impartiality as om buds we discussed options
he could choose to stay away from campus as much as possible
he control the perceptions of others and if attending events on campus was unsettling to him he may consider focusing on keeping himself well and disengaging in any events or activities that could exacerbate his anxiety
he could confront the senior administrator directly
he could reply to their email or ask for meeting and explain that he has confirmed that there are no restrictions no sanctions journal of the international mb uds man association si and that he looks forward to returning to campus now that the investigation is er
recognized the power differential and the perceived risk associated with appearing to challenge senior administrator
also tried to help him imagine conversation that would be productive and helpful rather than challenging and disruptive
he could report the senior administrator to the title ix office
those officers would have the authority to confront the administrator directly and then also monitor the further engagement as it related to his case
his reporting through th office would create record and at that point there were benefits associated with creating trail of action
we also discussed the risks of perceived retaliation if he the administrator
he had hoped to pursue in the discipline an valued the support of the senior academic leader
we discussed how the title ix office may be able to protect him from retaliation as well
could contact the administrator by phone and have an offline conversation expressing the concerns nd helping the administrator to understand due process
this would again breach confidentiality the administrator would know that he spoke with me
we discussed the risks associated with that but also the benefits of allowing the leader to respond app ro pria te ly in way that did not involve formal authorities
in the end the visitor and addressed this using combined approach
before he reported the email to title ix he asked if could inform them of it to see what they thought
the sheer notion of going back to that office created visceral fear in him but he recognized that he may need more formal support in case the administrator or other faculty retaliated
since the title ix officer already knew was involved going back to them seemed lo risk
visited the officer in face to face meeting and let them know about the communications with the student restricting him from access to campus faculty and events
informed them of the options that the student and had disc us sed and let them know that they might anticipate communication from him
told the officer that the student was unsettled by the notion of re visiting the title ix office and they understood
the officer offered to reach out to the student hoping hat may alleviate some of his anxiety but we agreed that we would reserve his right to initiate conversation if he chose to
the student sent an email to the officer asking for face to face meeting and they scheduled it immediately
the title ix off ic er contacted the academic administrator and let them know that they could not issue sanctions based on behavior that had already been reviewed in the hearing
at some point the academic administrator called me
assume they learned of my involvement either from the student or from the title ix office
in any case it was an informal conversation and welcomed it
the administrator discussed their own conflict in feeling the need to protect their students and faculty without unduly restricting the st freedom
assured them that the university was supportive of their concern and encouraged them to report any inappropriate conduct not perceptions that were disconcerting to faculty or students
the senior administrator withdrew the restriction that they imposed and the student has been granted free access to campus facilities
to my knowledge there have been no further incidents
do not know what would have happened to this visitor if the om buds office were not an option for him
he felt afraid and powerless and he did not perceive the university as an ally
by providing impartial informal confidential space to ask questions the visitor was able to navigate reasonable outcome and successfully progress in his academic program
the un was also able to avoid the potential loss of additional resources such as time money and institutional reputation
believe it is in these uneasy nuanced spaces that om buds should feel most valuable to their visitors and their organizations

not alone unless what you want when answered my phone was met with whisper
the voice on the other end was so soft my body leaned forward in order to listen more intently
elizabeth not her real name was obviously trying to be as clandestine as possible and the tinny reverb that accompanied her words gave me the impression that she was perhaps calling from stairwell or restroom
many times when people call the om buds office to schedule an appoint ment they do not resist the temptation to begin telling their story however it was obvious that elizabeth only wanted to handle the logistics of scheduling an appointment and hang up as quickly as possible
sensing this obliged and we agreed to meet the following day
wait there was one what is it
your office offer appointments only during regular business hours
it turns out elizabeth wanted to meet after business hours not feeling able to leave her desk in the middle of the day for an extended length of time
this was another context clue of her fear or nervousness and we agreed to meet at the following day
begin every one on one visit with description of the om buds office which includes an explanation of the om buds confidentiality independence informality and impartiality standards of practice
the confidentiality and informality standards seemed to interest elizabeth the most
could see her relief when she heard that would not reveal the fact that she was meeting with me or anything said to me and that the informality meant that there was no record of the meeting and no paper trail connecting her to the om buds
she would later tell me that hearing those two pieces is what al lowed her to feel safe enough to say things she said out loud to anyone before even her partner or her close family or friends
elizabeth was experiencing severe and pervasive sexual harassment at work from male colleague senior to her but no in her line of reporting
ronald not his real name was long time and well respected person in the office and he held significant amounts of positional authority and social cachet at all levels
elizabeth described series of events starting out so me what banal and escalating over time
while her guard was raised from the very first event she had reached her tipping point after ronald crossed physical by grazing her buttocks with his hand while past in the office break roo she froze
she ran through all the things she wanted to say to him she thought about me too and all of her feminist friends and family who would want her to confront ronald and tell him that his behavior was vile and wrong
she sa anything and she watched in silence as ronald walked away with smug look on his face
over the next few days the shame of her non response would consume her
she was afraid to tell her partner about what happened
she want to say anything to her co workers and she trust human resources hr
she currently seeing therapist and she want to go to her friends and family for fear of being gaslit being told what she should have done or what she should do now or being blame or judged
journal of the international mb uds man association si elizabeth knew about the om buds from training she had taken where she heard the line to go when you know where to
she cried lot in our time together and as our visit ended she thanked me for being able to mysel of the fear shame and anger that had built up like plaque over the course of several months
she left with an interim plan of reaching out to trusted co worker first and scheduled follow up visit in week to work out broader plan on how move forward
the phone rang again several days later
janet not her real name wanted to schedule an appointment and mentioned that she was referred by man named jeffrey not his real name
jeffrey happened to be the name of friend the one she had planned to speak with regarding behavior
this connection was confirmed when janet described that someone in her office named ronald manager above her in rank but man to whom she does not report made inappropriate comments to he of sexual nature
janet however made no mention of elizabeth and did not say anything in accord with the confidentiality protecting my visit with elizabeth
stephanie not her real name was the third person to visit with me with regards to ron al her relationship to ronald was identical to and however grievance was with non response to her report to them
in contrast to elizabeth or janet stephanie had initiated formal complaint process and was about how it was going
she wanted justice and she wanted to meet with an om buds to figure out what justice looks like and how to go about making it happen
one of the exceptions to om buds confidentiality is when visitor provides express written per mi ssi on for the om buds to reveal anything discussed in visit
stephanie took me up on this exception and gave permission for me to disclose her visit with me to other people who have met or will meet with me and to describe her being victim of sexual ha ra ss ment from ronald
permission was granted just in time for my follow up visit with elizabeth
elizabeth told me she had discussed her situation with jeffrey which she said was easier than she had expected because she had the chance to say it to me first
jeffrey said he had heard similar things from at least one other person to her surprise but also not to her surprise and that maybe they should all get together and talk
told elizabeth about stephanie and she told me she had talked with her the day before
she also connected with janet and two other people whom stephanie had known
after exploring some options elizabeth decided that the next best step would be for all five women to come as group to the om buds office to have safe confidential space to compare stories and work out what to do next now that they all knew about one another
the following week greeted five women into the office reiterated the om buds standards this time placing extra emphasis on confidentiality and facilitated conversation where these women who or barely know one another were able to connect through their shared experiences
after some time the conversation shifted to what do we do about this creep
she was in her own words for
she wanted to post on social media go to the paper speak as group to the executive committee and the director of the office and file every possible formal complaint including considering lawsuits
th other women agreed that they wanted to do something that they felt empowered as group and especially with verve but hesitated on creating too many waves too soon
when the meeting ended the group had not reached consensus on what do to ext
journal of the international mb uds man association si intervened to encourage the group by mentioning that consensus need to and often does not happen immediately
acknowledged that this was their first substantive conversation as group and that they may all be at different stages of proc es sing what has happened to them
proposed plan asked each of them to meet with me individually to explore the question that you know other people have experienced something similar to you and now that you know what some in the group want to do in order to move forward what would you like to do
warned them that this proposal would slow things down but they all agreed to have the individual visits
we discussed how they would stay safe during the process of the one on ones and other interim agreements and strategies
over the next several weeks met with each person to explore their answers to the aforementioned question
stephanie was resolute and remained true to her desired courses of action
the two people stephanie knew were on board with her plan
janet said that with strength she too would have the strength to public with
she expressed gratitude for the group and appreciated knowing she was not alone but she now fe lt burdened by new set of duties and expectations
she want to be wet on the group and she was combating peer pressure to move forward in way that like someone
in confidence elizabeth said to me but more to er self that she wanted to move forward more quietly
even more than that she expressed that she wanted to move forward independently
she expressed concern for upsetting the others and she want to appear as if she was abandoning them
she felt de ep ly connected with these women and their experiences but that was separate from how she wanted to figure things out for herself
elizabeth and spent the rest of our visit working out strategies on how she would communicate her feelings to stephanie and the others
we work shopped an email where she could simultaneously express solidarity and explain why she was going to go different route
reminded her that she could take advantage of the om buds to invite the others or even stephanie individually to have difficult conversation but in the end she left with the confidence that she could handle it on her own
elizabeth concluded our visit with slight smirk bemused at this unpredictable
she had always envisioned that she more like but as soon as she saw that she realized she
she learned that the complexity of life events binary and that she can be independent and supportive at the same time
she thought she would find absolute solace in the company of others and while she felt some what she realized in the end was that she had everything she needed within herself and was now ready to rely on her inner voice to guide her
never heard from her or any of the women again
several months after my last visit with elizabeth the president sent out an email to the entire office announcing departure from the company thanking him for his service lauding his talents and accomplishments over the years and inviting everyone to recept ion in his honor
part of the difficulty of the om buds role is not knowing how things end
and part of the frustration of not being part of the ending is questioning if the boundaries of the standards of practice makes us comp licit to the mis dee ds of others and the baffling inactions of our institutions with regards to keeping bad actors accountable
think of quote authored by john stuart mill men need nothing more to compass their ends than that good men should look on and do nothing
felt my service to the women victimized by ronald was to help them find their voices and determine how to use them words the volume the timing and the timbre of their voices
promoting systemic chan ge in some way
the journal of the international mb uds man association si typical channels through which om buds have voice all seemed
hiding behind informality and neutrality felt like the of which mill wrote
the company leadership sure felt pleased with the outcome
who knows how the women felt
sure ronald was no longer working with them but the thoughts and emotions of post harassment experiences are complex and layered
does he simp ly get to move on to his next job suffering only relatively minor inconvenience of finding new job
as an om buds just like with knowing how things end the answers to those questions will continue to remain unknown and
caveat mentor as an om buds pay careful attention to my personal subjective reactions to the people with whom interact in my role
even while am listening carefully at another level of consciousness ask elf questions is my body tense or relaxed
is my first reaction to like or dislike the person
is it easy to listen to them or is my mind wandering
am eager for the person to finish or am patient and willing to follow the ir discourse wherever it is going
how does their identity race gender sexual orientation age etc
affect me and how respond to them
this is one useful way to identify my biases ferret out feelings that could affect my interactions with the per son
it also allows me to evaluate critically whatever thoughts have about how to proceed with the case
also try to consider how would handle the case if were different person
sometimes if do not feel am con ne ct ing well with the person ask this even during our initial meeting
with others these questions do not arise until after the session
pay attention to that difference because it may tell me something about my feelings about person
this type of que stion based self reflection is necessary if am to treat people fairly
always have subjective reactions to people and let myself pretend that
for me being conscious of these reactions is the best way to keep them from biasing how in ter act with others
if am conscious of my reactions can at least try to control them
believe impartiality and neutrality are actually achievable but aspiring toward them is essential
that aspiration allows me to self correct as work on case
been an om buds for long time and worked with just about every sort of issue you can imagine and few that you probably imagine
among the most challenging interesting rewarding and painful are sexual harassment cases
having nt considerable part of my om buds career in universities have handled hundreds of sexual harassment cases
almost always they have deep impact these are not the cases forget about when go home at the end of the day
these are the ones stop thinking about that wake me up in the middle of the night
interactions with people involved in sexual harassment cases both harassers and victims are among the most intimate evocative and painful connections one can experience while in the om bud role
sexual harassment cases as well as cases that involved allegations about racism and discrimination have elicited the most intense and ongoing self reflective questioning of the sort described above
of course at times enhanced self consciousness can create problems by itself
this happened to me with sexual harassment case
female graduate student called for an appointment with me
she wanted to identify the issue on the phone which was perfectly fine
many people who come to an om bud want to say what it is in advance of meeting face to face
sometimes because they want to get measure of the om buds before deciding whether and what to reveal
when the student arrived at my office few days later was immediately taken by how beautiful she was
not beautiful in hollywood way but rather without self consciousness
this was not exactly the best beginning to working sexual harassment case the om buds struck by the appearance of the woman who had been harassed
but my pr act ice of self reflection allowed journal of the international mb uds man association si me to be conscious of my feelings admit to myself with some embarrassment to having them and put them aside
fortunately there was no indication that my private reaction to her was visible because she described her sit without hesitation and we very quickly got into an extended honest discussion
her story was compelling and in the same way had learned to push aside negative reactions to people found myself disliking focused my attention to what she was ay ing
it was clear from the beginning that she was mature mid articulate and very committed to her program of study literature and deeply engaged in her dissertation
the situation she described was not all that unusual in my om buds practice or in the experiences of fellow om buds in the academic world
but it was still challenging case
her advisor major scholar and literary figure in her field of study wanted sexual relationship with her
he had made that clear although mostly ind ire ct ly
she was not at all interested in him sexually but she said she found him otherwise to be an excellent advisor and very much respected his scholarship and his writing
when she finished her account of her situation described to her the full ran ge of options available to her under the university sexual harassment policy explained how the process of bringing charge worked and presented alternatives such as facilitated discussion or mediation with her advisor had lots of experience fac il it ating such discussions and conducting mediations
she knew almost immediately that she did not in any way want to pursue bringing charge either formally or informally
she was also adamant that she would not participate in direct conversation with her advisor even if it was mediated
she felt that if the advisor learned she had spoken with someone else about the situation he would end their working relationship and possibly retaliate
we also talked about possibly switching to different advisor her at the same university or even at another university where there might be faculty member with similar academic interests
neither of those options was appealing
she wanted to continue working with her advisor and to complete her dissertation
but escribing the options we discussed and the policies we reviewed give full sense of what that meeting was like
in the course of her account of her academic work asked about her dissertation topic
when substantial matters are at stake always ask faculty and graduate students about their academic work because it reflects their interests and how they think
as it happened knew bit about her area of study so we were able to talk about that too
it was good connection and came away wit fuller understanding of why she wanted to stick with her advisor even with all the complications raised by his interest in her sexually
toward the end of the session we developed strategic plan for how she would handle interactions and com munic at io ns with her advisor
she indicated that she was well practiced in deflecting advances but in this case she wanted to maintain the relationship while managing his expressions of interest in her
asked her to describe situations where he was more attentive to her work and less likely to come on to her
it turns out he was genuinely interested in her research topic and enjoyed extended discussions about various complexities of literary analysis
together we decided to focus more on those positive int er actions and to sidestep his propositions
the plan we developed was straight forward before meeting with him she would identify topic or problem that she wanted to discuss
at the beginning of each meeting with him she would bring up what it was she anted to discuss
also she would abbreviate discussion of personal matters with him beyond the usual social niceties of inquiring are you
if he began to question her about goings on in her life she would provide only the most cursory answers and shift as quickly as possible to discussing matters related to her dissertation
in addition she developed repertoire of possible responses to his expressions of interest in her all of them emphasizing that she did not want to have sexual rel at io ns hip with him but reiterating her respect for him and the importance of his guidance and mentor ing
we agreed to meet on an as needed basis to debrief how her dealings with the advisor had gone and refine her strategies for the upcoming weeks
on average we met every three or four weeks discussing the advisor and her progress on the dissertation
in those conversations could see how this approach was empowering her
when working with visitor who is trying to manage an ongoing problematic situation it is helpful for the om buds to offer periodic check ins
journal of the international mb uds man association si after bit less than year her dissertation completed she came back for final session to debrief and to say goodbye
when we finished talking got up to walk her to the door
just before lea vi ng she turned and gave me warm hug
not the recommended way to end sexual harassment case but in this case it was okay
although some sexual harassment cases have satisfactory ending for example the harassment ceases or the victim safely leaves th harassing situation still have dilemma
in situations where the victim will not pursue formal charges and decides to deal with the situation alone the harasser remains in place and unidentified
in these cases the very advantage of being conf id en ti al om buds people tell us about problems they will not disclose to anyone else feels like disadvantage
how can we prevent harassment from recurring
there are two steps that have found helpful
the first which seems obvious to me is that om bu ds should regularly report on the frequency of sexual harassment cases we are handling
this information should be included in annual reports and mentioned in regular meetings with leadership
if large number of cases are coming from within particular department would go to the head of the department explain that there have been number of cases recently and suggest that be invited to give talk to that department about sexual harassment
second almost always when meeting with victims who in my experience have typically been women they have mentioned not wanting anyone else to experience the same thing
consequently in cases where facilitate discussions or mediate between the harasser and the person harassed regularly raise the question what should happen if receive another complaint of sexual harassment about the same harasser
almost always both parties agree that in such circumstance as om buds am free to report to the appropriate authorities that there was settlement of rev io us harassment case
it is also important to remember that sometimes the om buds is the only campus resource victim is willing to turn to
if it were not for the presence of fully confidential om buds most victims who for whatever reasons are un wi ll ing to notify university officials of the harassment or bring formal charges would struggle and suffer alone
how confidentiality and integrity ignited om buds advocacy title ix of the education amendments of et seq
amending the higher education act of is federal gender equity law that prohibits discrimination based on sex in ed uca ti on programs and activities that receive federal funding
sexual harassment which includes sexual violence and other forms of non consensual sexual misconduct is form of sex discrimination and is prohibited under this law
in higher education title ix is the law that covers the me too era in reporting and gender equality
noncompliance with title ix can affect the availability of federal funds which can be deadly for most educational institutions
the om buds office is place of informality which places om buds decidedly outside of the formal title ix process
in my office we practice according to standards and are not designated reporters under institutional policy although we can provide clarity to visitors regarding title ix and its reporting process
visitor came to discuss options and ask questions
the visitor found out about the om buds office from another staff member and learned about the confidentiality that the om buds offers
confidentiality was the main reason th is visitor came to the om buds
she wanted place where everything was off the record and nothing would move forward without her blessing
mainly she wanted place to just talk first and see what could happen
as an om buds may not know exactly what visitor wants to discuss before meeting with them and that was true in this case
that is okay for my practice as like to be present with visitors as they share and not necessarily be solution oriented
oftentimes an issue brought up initially may not be the core concern of visitor
so allow my visitors time to feel safe and share what is important to them with me
aside from active listening time is my best asset
it is my duty to provide not only welcoming space but the freedom to talk
many administrators and decision journal of the international mb uds man association si makers do not always have that kind of time available for every employee but do
on average spend about minutes with each visitor
after briefly explained to the visitor how visit with the om buds works and assured her of our confidentiality gave her the floor
she shared that her supervisor of two years came to her office and confessed his affection and admiration for her
although he was married he wanted her to know that he valued the time they could spend al one together and that he like to with others in the department
he attempted to touch her shoulder but she excused herself to get water and to escape
no one should be made to feel uncomfortable in their body re especially at her place of employment
asked the visitor what she thought should be happening to get better sense of what she knew about the formal reporting processes
she only knew that she had one option report
asked her wha she wanted ideally and she wanted assurances that she would keep her job and not be subject to retaliation
identifying options is an exercise in walking visitor through outcomes via actions and letting the visitor find the path that agrees with them
by goal setting and finding out interests can help visitor identify those choices that maybe were not fully considered or realized before
as began to explore the option of reporting sexual harassment and explain the formal process to her saw er body language tighten
she looked away and began to fidget with her jacket
when asked her about it she shared that someone else in her department had mentioned something about sexual harassment and was immediately moved to different department tha was located miles away
she did not want any different treatment for herself or any shuffling that would jeopardize her child care arrangements
apprised her of another option do nothing
visitors tend to feel that something needs to happen and of ten ignore the do nothing wait hold option
wanted her to understand that doing nothing was also viable option while also understanding the consequences of doing nothing
we talked about other options that would shine small light such as sending an anonymous letter or reaching out to another supervisor who is mandated reporter
wanted to help her report if only to illuminate the issue for administrators
wished could be mandated reporter but also knew that being mandated reporter ld jeopardize my role as an om buds
wanted someone to report for the people who come forward at all
someone needed to illuminate this bad behavior and root it out before it spreads
was so devastated for her because she truly had no faith that he formal process would protect her
could sense her shame because she shared other instances of sexual harassment that she witnessed and she had written those occurrences off because they did not happen to her
she felt exempt until the unwanted attent ion was directed at her
was genuinely disturbed that the visitor was so afraid to use the formal process
she truly wanted anonymity which is something the formal process offer
from fairness perspective it is unfair to accuse someone of se xu al harassment and not allow the accused an opportunity to confront their accusers
however when formal processes do not offer the protection and safety that should be built in it creates chilling effect on reporting
if fear limits the viable options hat can share with someone it limits my ability to be an effective resource
from feedback that have received it seems that many employees have lost faith in the formal systems
there is very real lack of trust and perceptions of ret alia ti on abound
essentially people do not feel safe being self advocates and reporting wrongdoing
as many times as emphasize the law and its protections many people want to risk needing legal counsel to defend their position especially in close tight knit community
from daily interaction view believe that this was normal om buds visit where the om buds learns about an issue early and apprises someone of options that exist for them
one on one visits have been my primary method gathering information
believe it is valuable for visitor to journal of the international mb uds man association si have an impartial person to talk to who can help that visitor examine the many facets of their situation
but for this visitor the confidentiality could offer proved to be even more im po rt ant because she admitted that she would have continued to suffer silently had she not been able to access confidential listener
as much as wanted to follow up to know what happened one of the down sides of being an om buds is that may not always ge to find out what someone ultimately decides to do or what options they take
will often find out when an undiscussed path is taken and the visitor needs help identifying more options
but this time the story does have an end
year passed and the is it or reached out again
she shared that in moment of desperation she called human resources hoping to have confidential conversation
after listening to her the human resources representative informed the visitor that her statements would initiate title ix investigation into her allegations and all parties would be notified of the pending action
once the investigator contacted her she declared that she would not participate in the investigation and tried to withdraw from the title ix process
however the investigation continued and the accused was found not in violation of title ix provisions due to the lack of cooperation
she was reassigned to different supervisor but still has daily contact with the accused
she felt that the in happened to her without her consent and re victimized her all over again
continued to be listening ear for this visitor and confirmed that the om buds office is the only place in our institution that can guarantee confidential conversation for employees with limits
from trend development perspective began to question if others were reluctant to come forward due to fear and became more vigilant about seeking opportunities to inform the policy and personnel changes eg ar ding title ix issues and reporting
since meeting with this visitor knew that had duty to address the lack of trust and protection from retaliation for those who do use formal reporting processes
resolved to become more vocal and use my om bud practice to do more
when the institution began incorporating new policies and guidance from the department of education demanded seat at the table as an advisor to provide insight and mediation expertise
as result was able to compare policies from other institutions and provide insight about the psychological safety of formal processes while simultaneously advocating for varied levels of informal resolution techniques that will hopefully address the needs of those who choose to report at ion
as om buds we have duty to confidentiality independence informality and impartiality
believe we also have duty to integrity
the webster and cambridge dictionaries define integrity as the quality of being honest and having firm adherence to strong moral principles
for me integrity means acting in moral fortitude and having the strength to speak up to be an active participant in change instead of settling for the fringe
om buds are strategically positioned within our org ani zat ions to see things before they happen
this means that om buds are often aware of issues well before the masses
om buds know about chronic problems that have plagued our organizations and om buds often know about the solutions that have failed or are in need of reworking
om buds see the successes of our organizations as well as areas of growth
and om buds fail when we try to protect our organizations by only pursuing individual victories instead of widespread systematic change
there are times when there is not much we can do as om buds
our role is often one of empowering our visitors to self determination
but just like our visitors we should focus on what we can do and the options that are available to us
om buds need to remain current by collaborating wi th other om buds and conflict resolution peers
om buds need to use meetings and strategic conversations to regularly plant those seeds of innovation and change
om buds need to use annual reports and mid year reports to highlight places that are overlooked nd recommend fixes for those shortcomings
om buds need to use feedback surveys as data points and concrete measures to support our recommendations
most importantly om buds need to get comfortable with being uncomfortable especially when it means chal le ng ing and pushing back against the status quo when it does not serve visitors
in the future resolve to be an active participant in change and not passive observer
my integrity journal of the international mb uds man association si means being light illuminating the path and casting away shadows
walk ing in integrity means being an advocate
choose to rethink my role as an om buds and actively seek the place where my impartiality is not threatened by my advocacy
humility helps in maintaining neutrality it was toward the end of long summer just before labor day
however the whole research establishment was buzzing
our laboratories were expanding it looked as if several new drugs might be launching within the next three years
there were scientists coming in from all over to check out new ways of looking at several famously hopeless problems
the atmosphere was alive every day of every year
as an om buds in this environment loved the zany nature of the place and especially enjoyed the fact that was dealing with at least four generations of employees and people from all over the world
the summer had also been lively with trainees from everywhere
one of these trainees came to see me to talk about her roommate
she said that her roommate had been excited about er work was suddenly depressed and perhaps ill
the roommate had stopped talking for maybe ten days did not respond to questions and absolutely would not go to the nursing station
the trainee was very concerned she decided to come to the om buds office because she did not want to betray her roommate and she knew we were confidential
would be willing to see her roommate
did see her will tell you the story using pseudonyms
when the roommate came in she did indeed seem drawn and upset
at first she did not seem to wish to talk she just said am
decided to talk as little as possible but started out with one of my almost universally successful questions at that research establishment
understand you are from far away what ma de you think about coming here for the summer
after few minutes of silence this question seemed to catch attention
anna spoke of her long standing interest in the work of one of the labs and her enormous respect for the lab director dr ur ing half an hour she discussed having read some dozens of dr articles
she seemed at one moment to allude to the fact that something had happened few weeks ago but could not quite understand the sentence and did not want to pry
she then wan te to leave but agreed to come back the next day
the next day anna did return
over the course of that day and the next heard that she had stopped by dr office on monday in mid summer to ask questions about two articles
she had prepared the questions in writing she showed me the piece of paper
it had been very hot that day
anna said that she had however gone to the office dressed quite conservatively
she had knocked at the door knocking she said several times
she concluded that he mig ht have been deeply engaged with someone else but then he came to the door
she then described in the same quiet and careful detail how he had invited her in and subsequently raped her
listened with care for an hour taking no notes asking no quest ions my heart sinking
this concern ranked among the most appalling assault complaints had heard
finally offered number of options from which she might choose
in brief she could choose an option now or think about it
the options included num be of informal and formal resources
did she want to consult with family or local clergy or talk again with the doctor she had seen
she could pursue an option alone or with any of several possible accompanying persons
she decided to write formal comp la int could she work with me on it
journal of the international mb uds man association si over the course of the next appointment anna read her complaint with the same sad careful attention to detail that had noted earlier
she included the date in mid july and time of day and many other facts such as demeanor and clothing and her memories of their discussion
she recalled sadly looking at famous photo on his wall during the assault
the photo showed dr accepting famous award
think hardly spoke at all thinking of myself as simply there for support
anna seemed to have thought things through
when she finished she gave me the complaint it was addressed to the head of corporate security in accordance with one of the formal options we had discussed
would ake it to the head of the security office
felt deeply sad and was deeply angry
said that would take the complaint immediately
respected our security office and was relieved that anna had chosen formal complaint
walked over to se cur it wondering in pain how many other trainees had been assaulted
in the event the head of the security office was in
the head of security read letter with the respect and care expected
listened carefully to the ensuing plan
the head of sec uri would need to go immediately to dr for one thing we had no way of knowing whether dr might pose continuing danger to trainees or others
late that evening was glad to get call at home had hardly been able to breath it turned out that dr had recently returned to the us from many weeks away he had left in june on long trip to several different countries
dr had produced his passport and his schedule for each day on long trip with photos in faraway ce for the date in july
his office had been locked for almost all of his trip for repairs to the ceiling and repainting
in addition the head of security had been able to establish that anna had worked in another building nt ire ly all summer and almost always on team
the work and her hours had been recorded and dated
saw the copy that had been made of her lab notebook in her handwriting in the ordinary custom of our labs
she had never missed day or been ate she worked with her team on the fated monday
only very few people ever heard about this case
the details were considered definitive and no one else would need to know
was told that anna immediately been assisted by counsellors and had dr the matter
the record in security was placed in special file
never heard again from her or her roommate nor did hear from dr but have never forgotten the event
have grieved ever since about the distress and ain that anna went through the shock and grief that dr must have experienced and perhaps the distress of others in their families
was thankful that the bystander trainee had felt she would be welcome and annas privacy safe in the om buds office
if not what might have happened
thought anna might have gotten more acutely ill and perhaps hurt herself
anna might have left suicide note or taken other routes to make public her story about dr knew was lucky that had had the time when anna came in just to sit and really listen suppose anna had not felt safe to tell me what she was thinking
have reminded myself many times since that listening attentively but silently may be essential
also learned very painfully that week bit more about how may require fair investigations
learned more about my need for humility about my own intuitive judgment this case taught me that in many cases simply will not have the
learned that can almost always offer empathy but need to be able to withhold judgment sometimes for long periods about the facts
learned more about how important it is for all our constituents that om buds are designated as neutrals albeit often working with other professionals to find advocacy and justice for our visitors
and learned one more time about how hard it is to be neutral
journal of the international mb uds man association si
honoring self determination despite moral outrage this narrative unpacks challenging sexual harassment related case that experienced as an organizational om buds
while the case details are striking and complex emphasize practice reflections and considerations
details have been altered to further protect the anonymity of those involved
case details part new visitor arrived at my office visibly anxious and timid
after some brief opening remarks asked her to help me understand what led her to contact the om buds office
she immediately said need you to understand the history of my situ ati on so that the issue am here to talk about will make sense but the history is not something interested in addressing
want to be very clear about
her pointed statement piqued my curiosity
it also signaled that this case could challenge my commitment to honoring my self determination that is supporting her capacity to make her own choices regarding how she would like to proceed
the visitor proceeded to tell me that she had been working in the organization for almost four years
three years ago while she was an intern senior member of the department forced himself onto her and raped her after night out with colleagues
before then she considered the senior colleague to be trusted friend and professional mentor
so much so that in the midst of struggling with her sexuality at the time she had confided in him that she was gay something she had not yet disclosed to other very important people in her life
on top of the trauma she experienced as result of the rape and th self doubt and questioning that crept in afterwards she felt betrayed and blackmailed
personally she feared he would retaliate by disclosing her sexuality if she confronted him or reported the incident and that was something she was not prepared to fa ce
professionally as an intern looking to launch her career she was terrified about the potential impact reporting the incident could have on her reputation and professional future in relatively small field
he was someone with significant amount of influence
sadly she also worried that in the absence of any witnesses or evidence no one would believe her and the formal system intended to handle these issues would not help or protect her
so she ultimately decided not to report the incident er after sharing some of her experience with trusted peer she learned that the same man had also sexually harassed another colleague who was suffering from severe depression
she was disgusted by his willingness to target and ray on people who were psychologically vulnerable had less power in the organization and were dependent on him in some way
despite not reporting the incident at the time it happened she explained that she was able to physically stay away from him and uc cess fully complete her internship
she also sought counseling in the last year of her program and eventually felt like she was emotionally able to move on
her purpose in reaching out to the om buds office was not to discuss what had happened in the past
she recently learned that the alleged perpetrator who was still working in the organization and was since promoted to lead department of his own had just applied to be mentor for an internship program that she was involved in
now she was on the committee that oversaw the program and reviewed applications for incoming interns and interested mentors
when she saw his application to be mentor she panicked
she was concerned about her own well being and the future well being of any intern over which he would have power
she hoped that the om buds office could help her explore ways to stop him from being mentor without having to disclose the details of what happened to her in the past
she was adamant about not wanting to disclose information from the past to anyone other than confidential resource relive the trauma by going through formal process and reveal the name of the alleged perpetrator including to me
reflections part journal of the international mb uds man association si begin my reflections by ack no wl edging the emotional toll experienced listening to her story
felt stunned and sad before eventually shifting to intense feelings of exasperation disgust and even outrage
it was difficult to prevent critical questions from swirling around in my how can this be going on in our organization
how can someone like that continue to work here
what will happen if this goes undetected
my emotional journey tested my ability to demonstrate deep sense of empathy understanding and respect while also maintaining and managing the moral outrage that felt
imagine other om buds have struggled to strike this necessary balance in their own cases
here are some strategies used to manage the emotional toll maintain comfortable sense of impartiality an keep the focus off of me and on the visitor
stayed present and sat in the uncomfortable and difficult emotional space with the visitor
did not rush eliminate or move on from it
decided that expressing my emotional reaction was not as much hr eat to my impartiality as it was signal of my caring and humanity which is often needed to build connection and trust
created space listened and reflected back what heard
made sure to acknowledge her emotional experience the reasoning for er decisions at the time and the critical issues concerns and questions that she faced in the present situation
acknowledged that could never truly understand the impact of her experiences
did not pretend to know what it was like to go through wh at she described
when we om buds hear from visitor we often hold open the possibility that there is another story or perspective to consider
sometimes we may even voice that directly
there are good reasons for why we do that
for starters it can tr eng then our independence and impartiality
for instance an om buds may thoughtfully challenge claim that visitor makes about coworker being disrespectful and intentionally trying to sabotage their work
in many cases this practice does not present an issue or dilemma
in sexual harassment case however introducing another perspective or challenging assertions visitor makes is difficult and potentially dangerous
although simply holding open in my mind only the possibility that visitor not telling the story or the full story can help me manage the moral outrage and allow me to maintain impartiality without sacrificing empathy understanding and respect
it was important for me to remember that if the alleged perpetrator in this case contacted the om buds because he felt falsely accused of something that was potentially damaging to his career or preventing him from accessing professional development opportunities would have provided him with the same access to impartial om buds er vices
as an om buds constantly remind myself that am not positioned to know what is right or best for someone
strive to set my human judgments aside honor self determination and let people make their own decisions
this approach became incredibly im porta nt in this case
an important om buds practice value like self determination can easily be ignored if an om buds feels moral outrage or succumbs to the temptation to want to
the assumptions we might make about what it means to help someone or fix the ir problem can get us in trouble
our idea of help may not be what is most useful to the visitor
in fact it can cause greater harm or cause om buds to push the boundaries of their role
think this dynamic can play out in two different ways
we might fee tempted to rescue the visitor or it for them
this could lead us to offer advice or overly assure sympathize and try to console
we might also feel tempted to think critically of the visitor especially if we think they do the right thing such as reporting the case
this could lead us to engage in ways that come across as judgement blame lecturing or interrogating
none of which is helpful to the visitor
in order to approach the rest of my discussion with the visitor from place genuine curiosity and respect for self determination recalled phrase that is used in the sexual and gender violence field is survivor
that phrase grounded me and reminded me that was in no position to determine what was best for my visitor in this situation
it is my job instead to journal of the international mb uds man association si create comfortable space for her to share her experience work on understanding what is most important or concerning to her and explore with her ways she might be able to address those concerns nd accomplish her goals
as previously stated one reason the visitor decided not to report the rape when it happened was her lack of trust in the system for handing sexual assault cases
she did not feel confident that people would believe protect or help her
those comments stood out to me
knew that regardless of how the visitor chose to moved forward it would be important for me to understand more specifically what created the distrust
that information could be used to ive feedback to the departments that design and implement that system
better understanding of the distrust can help the organization make changes to addressing those concerns
in my opinion the confidential and informal nature of the om buds role places us in great position to collect and use that information from our visitors
therefore after explaining that was not surprised by her lack of trust in the system and explaining that my question was not coming from an yi ng place of judgment but instead genuine curiosity asked her to elaborate on what caused her to feel such distrust
told her that was asking because the om buds office is in unique position to be able to understand those concerns and give the or ga ni zati on feedback without having to violate commitments to confidentiality
she explained that she did not trust the system because she was aware of unfavorable experiences others had with the system
those unfavorable experiences boiled down to fee li ng misunderstood unsupported judged and labeled throughout the process mixed messages about what to expect in the process delayed processing of the case the potential for retaliation through ineffective insensitive and flawed strategies of ot if yi ng the alleged perpetrator inadequate investigation strategies leading to cases or questionable information gathering and limited protections for survivors during and after the process regardless of the outcome
case details par ii as we proceeded decided to revisit the main question
how can information be shared in way that prevents the alleged perpetrator from being mentor without requiring the visitor to disclose her story and risk further emotional distr es or trigger an unwanted formal report
additionally the visitor did not want any information that she would share to get back to the alleged perpetrator
with that question in mind we started to explore options
we first explored whether there was any on with influence over the intern program that she would feel comfortable speaking with
the visitor mentioned that she had close and trusting relationship with the director of the intern program
before coming into my office she had thought about having conversation with that director and remained interested in that option
in way she was looking for validation from me that it was reasonable approach
while was not prepared to simply validate that option did help her think about how that op ti on could help achieve her goals
we also discussed the potential risks associated with the option
in the end she expressed desire to proceed with that option
we shifted the conversations to start talking about specific strategies for the con vers at io with the director
we talked about strategies that conveyed level of seriousness about the concerns stayed within what she felt comfortable disclosing and did not run the risk of triggering mandatory reporting action by the director
we als identified specific language and questions that she felt confident communicating
she left my office with the intention of approaching the director as soon as possible
few days later the visitor reached out to share that she had conversed with the di rector
she said it was well received
she felt confident that the alleged perpetrator would most likely not be accepted as mentor in the program and she did not have to disclose the details of her situation
reflections par ii remember walking away from the initial meeting feeling torn
while felt pleased with my commitment to self determination and the standards of practice also felt like had my hands journal of the international mb uds man association si tied by my role and was in some ways feeling uncomfortable wi th not being able to do more
could walk away from this case knowing that someone in the organization was potentially committing such heinous acts and away with it
as previously mentioned the visitor did not feel comfortable sharing the name of the alleged perpetrator which is fine
my commitment to honoring self determination confidentiality and maintaining impartiality was enough to prevent me from taking any sort of action without the permission of the visitor but even if wanted to disregard the standards of practice or interpret them differently would have been limited in what could have done without knowing who the alleged perpetrator was
the case offered healthy reminder of the unique kind of experience the om buds office can create for people in these situations and how empowering that can be
it is space where visitors can feel heard and not judged or pressured
space where they can feel reassured by knowing they maintain control over what happens with the information they share and decisions that are made
believe the standards of practice help om buds stay in their during these critical cases
deviation from our role can do further harm
in cases like the one de scribed feel strongly that any further action that would require an om buds to step outside the boundaries of their role is best left up to professionals who are trained to provide advocacy advice or counseling for survivors
they are likely to be more effective than an om buds who decides to disregard impartiality to pursue advocacy
similarly an employee who is legally responsible to report sexual assault allegations is better prepared to do that than an om buds who succumbs to snap judgements and des to violate confidentiality when there is not an imminent risk of harm
some readers might wonder why did not do more with the little information had
some readers may interpret the issues as raising imminent risk of harm
while stand by my pr ac ti ce decisions respect those different opinions and welcome further dialogue around those opinions within our field
in the end was able to at least find various ways to use the information received about distrusting the formal system to provide anon feedback to key stake holders
fortunately the organization was already going through process of assessing and redesigning their policies processes and mechanisms for preventing and addressing sexual harassment complaints
the feedback provided was well received and taken into consideration as those changes were made
this case challenged me in many ways
feel fortunate to have the opportunity to reflect on some of those challenges through this narrative
hope my reflections help promote dia lo gue and debate in the om buds field about how we handle these kinds of cases and how om buds fit into the larger context of trying to prevent and address sexual harassment in organizations
cultural dynamics in sexual haras case this is description of real case of an om buds visitor at university in the usa
the case events took place prior to the era but title ix of the educational amendments of and the civil rights act of were in place
sexual harassment is recognized as form of sex discrimination under both title ix and the civil rights act
the setting for this case was university where the om buds office reports to the office of the provost
the om buds office was set up in prior to the establishment of the international ombudsman standards of practice
the om buds was asked to handle collateral duties for the institution and served students faculty and staff
one fall day chrissie moll oy fictitious name came an appointment to the om buds office
chrissie was graduate student white woman about years old and somewhat petite in journal of the international mb uds man association si stature
at our first meeting she said she had come to know of the om buds office when she attended an outreach presentation about the office
chrissie said she was extremely nervous as she began to describe her situation
she clenched her fist and frequently placed her hand against her mouth
she said she was doctoral candidate she had completed her course work and pre li mi nary examinations
she had scholarship which allowed her to teach course and advise undergraduate students in seminar
chrissie had an issue with her professor who was of asian origin and the chair of her doctoral committee
earlier that fa ll chrissie had accepted an offer from dr to rent room in his house
she said dr was over years old single traveled often and occasionally fell ill
dr had proposed that she could live rent free in part of his house and in lieu of rent she was to watch his house when he travelled and run some small errands for him from time to time
the errands were sporadic like grocery shopping and picking up mail at the post office
chrissie offered that she liked to cook and he said he would en jo her cooking
he too offered to cook for them
this seemed like good deal to her as his house was close to the campus and she could walk or bike over
the arrangement was good for about two months
dr sometimes dropped in visit with her in her sitting area or stopped by to show her journal articles on topics of mutual interest
he asked for help in getting his tie knotted or finding that tweed jacket he wore last fall
there were some moments of closeness an chrissie thought of these personal requests as something she would do for her father or uncle
dr was diabetic and there were times when he consumed too much alcohol
upon drinking he would be belligerent and ask her to do things that were un com for table start his laundry make his bed or serve him dinner in bed
when she protested or sulked he threatened her by saying that she would never finish her because she had bad or that she would face academic consequences
chrissie said dr touched her or tried to stroke her especially when he was in good mood
on occasion he held her hand or brushed her hand against his cheek or caressed her hair
she did not think of his behavior as or
chrissie said she tried to see his behavior from his cultural point of view
she told me that in his native asian culture his behavior would be read as affection
she said men of his age and profession tended to dominate women and younger per sons they expected women even older women to do their bidding anticipate their needs even carry their luggage and wait on them
older men expected deference from everyone especially younger women
after some six months chrissie was more un com for ta with the situation and told dr that she had signed up for graduate student housing and she would soon move out
he threatened that her scholarship funds would be taken away and she would not be given references
he would talk to his departmental colleagues to ensure they would not support her
she would be denied access to archives and collections in his native country that were essential to her dissertation research
chrissie was shocked scared and immobilized
she did not know what to do she felt that her situation was untenable
she was alone and thought few would understand her situation
visit to the om buds office gave her chance to talk about the strange and difficult situation
she wanted to leave her rental arrangement with dr but she was afraid to do so
her main concern centered on the consequences to her if she moved out
what retaliation would she face and how could she finish her doctoral study
many questions surfaced during ur conversations which ranged from social justice to interpersonal relations
was chrissie disadvantaged in this situation
did the situation fall into the category of harassment
was there an on going risk or risk of imminent harm
what were her bound ar and how would she know when she had lost sight of them
was she taking responsibility for dr behavior
what was his responsibility as professor
did the journal of the international mb uds man association si department chair senior faculty or other members of her committee know of this arrangement
had she spoken to her friends and colleagues
offered her the option to discuss her situation and dilemma with the office of prevention of sexual harassment where she would have an option to begin formal process but she recoiled at the suggestion
she vehemently objected to the option saying that call from that office might engender an investigation and spin the problem out of control
she needed plan whereby she could slip out of dr clutches without aggravating him so that he would not retaliate against her
in our discussions chrissie reflected on her feelings and discussed her perspective as well as that of professor dr at times chrissie would say dr was sweet and kind to her and she was the one who as letting him down
she took responsibility for the initial decision she made in renting space from him
she said that perhaps unconsciously she sought secondary gains like access to resources and collections and greater support from dr yet even she took responsibility for her own actions she was protective of dr she could not bring herself to point to his failure to live up to his side of the bargain and his use of threats to prevent her from moving out
as our discussions went on it became increasingly evident that sense of boundaries in this situation had blurred and she was immobilized
ultimately she would have to decide what she wanted to do and how she would go about it
we discussed the pros and cons of each course of action available to her
she said she could not enlist support from her doctoral faculty and colleagues as they would be unwilling to rock the departmental boat
gradually with empathy and support chrissie began to erst and the interpersonal and systemic dynamics of power in harassment
she was able to understand the dynamics of power at an individual interpersonal cultural and institutional level that led to the continuance of the problem behaviors
she understood her role and rights as student in the usa and her own behavior that was submissive to dr expectations of submissiveness
in addition dr dependence on alcohol contributed at an interpersonal level
his gender dominance and her own adherence his cultural expectations fostered and reinforced his negative behavior
coaching and discussions on these hidden factors helped her to reconsider her initial assumptions about culturally driven behaviors
pointed out that although her professor was fo reign born he had lived in the united states for over years and was sophisticated citizen of the world
surely he had learnt about boundaries for students and faculty in all these years in the academy
we had come from fall spring
urged chrissie to use the upcoming spring break to get some distance from her situation and to prepare dr for the eventuality of her moving out
in the meantime dr had suffered two episodes of as his drinking and diabetes converged
chrissie felt she could not abandon her professor and risk his death
she worried that she had used him
at this point suggested she may benefit from some distance
chrissie agreed and went to visit her aunt for few days
during the break worried if too had lost my boundaries as an om buds
wondered if had become her counselor or friend
was beginning to feel frustrated that she was not taking any action but did not want to close her case or leave her stranded with an unresolved situation
addressed this dilemma by setting some limits suggested three more meetings after spring break after which we could her case until she figured out what she wanted
when chrissie returned after spring break we began the task of re framing the problem
proposed that she was experiencing gender harassment and sexual harassment with hostile environment
initially she could not see the as it was she who sought to live in professor home as his tenant
nor could she see professor dr who was head of her doctoral committee as being neglectful
we progressed to framing the problem as fear of retaliation
retaliation is widely known to be illegal today but fear of retaliation is still one of the journal of the international mb uds man association si reasons ic ti ms do not report harassment
through our discussions chrissie became more familiar with the law and concepts such as gender based harassment sexual assault and hostile environment
central to all of these are issues of power and domination
after he last discussion saw shift
chrissie agreed to consultation with the head of the office for prevention of sexual harassment to better understand institutional policy and options for dealing with harassment
at personal level chrissie had begun to define her boundaries and assess where she had lost definition of boundaries
chrissie was about to begin her new journey and take some risks
chrissie and developed new action plan she would speak to the chair of her department and voice her co including her fear of retaliation
she would request the department chair to appoint new chair for her doctoral committee
the plan was to communicate the request to dr as transition that was warranted by dr health and the awkwardness of her situation
next she would visit the other two members of the doctoral committee and request their support
after this communication if there was need for neutral third party would step in and if necessary we would invite consultation with the coordinator of the office for the prevention of sexual harassment
chrissie visited her department chair and he promised his support
however when he spoke to the professor he found that dr had his heels dug in did not see the need for chrissie move out of his house
he threatened to remove her from his circle
at this point the department chair called the om buds office and invited consultation
with permission and participation we dev ised modified plan that chrissie was comfortable with
the department chair convened meeting with dr the om buds and the coordinator for the office for the prevention of sexual harassment
chrissie was invited to the meeting but declined to be th ere
she gave us permission to speak to these issues with dr as an om buds who had some experience with cross cultural issues in asian communities thought decision to be absent at the meeting was based on her cultural understanding of dr and his approach to conflict resolution her absence at the meeting would help dr to in front of his student
at the meeting with dr we discussed the range of behaviors that create an uncomfortable and unpredictable environment for students the issues of harassment and the fear of retaliation
dr was provided with detailed appraisal of the policy on sexual harassment and received complete educational discussion on the underlying issues of power
dr was not acc used of misconduct because it was apparent that he understood the concerns placed before him
the chair also understood that there was delicate balance here
helping dr to maintain his dignity and save face was important to constructive and informal resolution
accusations of misconduct would escalate the conflict adversely affect his sense of honor and perhaps create sense of shame
toward the end of the meeting dr agreed that chrissie would move out and he would not act against her as that would appear to be retaliatory
chrissie was invited to second meeting with dr by the department chair
the head of the office for prevention of sexual harassment and as om buds were also at the meeting
the purpose of this meeting was to comm un ic ate final understanding
dr assured chrissie that he would facilitate her moving out and would not retaliate in any way
the department chair appointed new doctoral committee chair within her discipline while dr continued to be on the committee as subject expert
the transition was managed by the department chair
chrissie found new accommodations moved out of dr house and completed her doctoral thesis
as an om buds one of the challenges faced in this case was peeling back the individ interpersonal institutional and cultural layers of the situation in which gender based dominance and harassment were the central problems
while dr might have expected deference and servile behavior from male student he would not have expected this level of subordination
it journal of the international mb uds man association si was not clear if some of dr behaviors were of sexual nature as interpersonal behaviors such as touching are considered as sexual in some contexts and cultures
however institutional rules and sexual harassment laws do not provide for cultural variations and explanations
fortunately chrissie moved out and completed her thesis and her reputation was not jeopardized
the active bystander years back visitor approached my om buds office because she was uncomfortable with the behavior of male staff member towards another female employee in the department
according to the visitor the male staff member married man would say and do things tha would make her colleague uncomfortable like asking her to lunch commenting on her looks or when he thought no one was watching her colleague
the visitor shared that her colleague would just freeze when confronted with this behavior nd awkwardly smile
though the conduct was not happening directly to the visitor she was uncomfortable just seeing and hearing his behavior
as bystander my visitor felt that the behavior needed to be in the before it escalated
we talked about options and how there were actually two questions she was working through
one issue was how the situation impacted her the second was what her colleague could do about the situation
each question led to courses of action possibly separate and diff ere nt from the other
she disclosed that she had already talked to their supervisor who somewhat brushed things off
asked what she thought about raising the issue to the next supervisory level or human resources
the is it or want to escalate things she just wanted her colleague to get help
explored with her the option that she could talk with her female colleague and encourage her to reach out to the om buds office
the visitor comfortable doing this be cause she wanted to stay out of messy situation
she wanted someone else to address the problem
then offered the visitor another option
stated that could reach out to her female colleague let her know that an anonymous fellow employee had not ic ed the male behavior towards her and that the om buds office could be resource for her
the visitor felt comfortable with this option
she felt that enough people had overheard and seen the behavior so that her female colleague ne cess suspect it was she who had raised the issue with me
not often that use this somewhat indirect approach but have found it helpful on few occasions where visitor simply needs message to be delivered
al th ough surprised by the call she listened to what had to share acknowledged that the male colleague had said uncomfortable things to her and stated that she would think about what if any action to take
she seem to want to talk further so in di cat ed that the space to talk would always be there if she chose to
when checked with the active bystander about month later she indicated that whatever had done worked because the male colleague was no longer making comments towards her colleague
assumed that perhaps the male colleague got the message and that maybe he had been confronted by someone his supervisor someone else or even the female colleague he had been harassing
but as sometimes happens situations come back
few months later female visitor scheduled an appointment
did not realize until midway through her narrative that this was the same female employee that the bystander in her department had contacted me about months back
she was now reach ing out because she was concerned that her male spouse was spreading rumors about her to her supervisor accusing her of being home wrecker who should journal of the international mb uds man association si not be employed by the institution
apparently the spouse had emailed number of people the institution alleging that the visitor was having an affair with her husband the male colleague that the bystander visitor had complained about
she acknowledged to me that she and her male colleague had been drinking at conference recently but no thing improper was happening
she just wanted this to stop spreading rumors about her
we talked about her options and the ways the om buds office could help
though she said she would keep me updated she respond to my follow up call this is not terribly unusual
as om buds we sometimes are only trusted with bits and pieces of information
but because we hear from many individuals we are sometimes able to piece together bigger narrative
sometimes we are the first to learn things sometimes we are the last
in this case eventually learned that the female employee and her now husband the male employee whom the bystander visitor had complained about had begun an affair shortly after she the organization
learned indirectly later that the supervisor knew about the romance and had tried to be discreet in not letting others know
the manager had concluded that so long as the affair did not become disruptive and no policy was being vi ola ted management would stay out of it
the assumption there of course was that because the relationship was consensual others in the department would not be troubled or impacted by the affair
however at least one person in the department was imp ac te the bystander became concerned about sexual harassment and had visited the om buds office
eventually the situation became more public with the spurned spouse and presumably even more disruptive to the department
never learned how that situation tur ned out but hope all people involved in the situation eventually found some resolution
for me had already found closure
long ago after many situations where was frustrated in not knowing the outcome of matters decided needed new standard success
success to be defined by whether all parties to matter reached resolution or whether they notified me of the outcome
instead success would be found in knowing had performed my duties in way consistent with my code that every ind interact with has my undivided attention and without judgment offer them ideas options techniques and tools that might shift their situation
what they do with that offering is up to them
as an old zen koan once taught me you offer someone gift and the recipient declines the gift who does the gift belong to
and so for me closure always comes in accepting and acknowledging that my relationship to maintaining consistent practice is what defines resolution
it is the gift we as om buds offer others and one that ultimately though we share always belongs to us
it is also gift that active bystanders give to the organization
one of the powerful lessons for me in this case was the importance of that first visitor whom ca ll ed the active bystander who did something that unfortunately tends to be the exception she took in what was happening around her was mindful of how events were impacting others and did something about it
it is so much easier for members of an org ani zati on to note there are problems and simply look the other way
those individuals may think not their problem and may say to themselves all have problems so why take on more
they want to be the one who tattles or snitches on co workers
and even if situation may not involve danger of physical harm there is an emotional risk when bystanders have courage to step out of the shadows and share concern
and so inactive bystanders see what is happening and ignore it
others the active by standers are troubled by what they see and as difficult as it might be reach out for assistance
here the relationship that troubled the active bystander was consensual but what if it been
in reaching out the bystander created positive ch ain reaction that was gift to her coworker
by reaching out to me the active bystander was empowered with options and felt comfortable with me reaching out to the alleged victim who then felt comfortable with the om buds office and reached out herself at er when she had concern
moments are all gift some we can accept while others we can and perhaps should decline
active bystanders are courageous colleagues who offer gift that may be what someone needs journal of the international mb uds man association si in the moment
whether the person need it or not the active bystander shows they care and that got their back
an informal approach to title ix case as an om buds at higher education institution do not typically facilitate conversation on issues that fall under the purview of the title ix coordinator
however one unusual case involving student whom will refer to as terrie took different turn
terrie was finishing up her pre med undergraduate requirements and was ready to move on to the next phase of her medical training
she was part of small cohort of students moving through the program
she had become close with two male pre med students who were part of cohort
she thought of them as and had no sexual interest in them
this team of three spent hours studying together
all was well until they decided to attend an off campus party on friday night
it was the end of fi na ls week and she was ready to relax and enjoy some down time with her friends
after being at the party for few hours terrie noticed that her two male friends were extremely inebriated terrie decided to leave early and caught an home
she later is covered that her friends stayed behind and continued drinking
she however was home by around pm
later that night around am one of the male friends began text ing terrie
the first text said wh er are you
do you want to come back out and party with us
she declined stating she was already in bed and ready to sleep
what followed were series of indecent pictures of genitalia
the last text asked terrie if she wanted to have sex
un su re what to do terrie turned off her phone made sure all her windows and doors were locked and tried to sleep that night
she was very upset and confused and she blamed herself she know what to do
she remembered presentation on sexual harass me nt during orientation and decided to contact the title ix coordinator in the morning
the next morning terrie made an appointment with the title ix coordinator and she met with her later that afternoon
terrie brought the texts and pictures sent to her from her male friends and showed them to the coordinator
after terrie described the incident the coordinator asked terrie what she wanted to happen
terrie stated that she sure but she was sure she wanted her friends to understand how much they her and how disappointed she was in their behavior
terrie sure which friend sent the pictures but she believed the two male friends were together when the pictures were sent
she received the texts from one number but she also believed that he friends acted together
the coordinator explained to terrie that she had more than one option
her first option was to file title ix incident report and follow the university process of an investigation which included interviews and panel
terrie sked what would happen to her friends
the coordinator was unable to give her definitive answer but did say that her friends could face variety of consequences including the possibility of dismissal from the medical program
terrie stated that she di not want that to happen to them
the coordinator gave terrie second option mediated conversation between the male friends the om buds and terrie
the coordinator had often worked with the om buds regarding bias and discrimination cases in the past and felt that an informal confidential impartial and independent approach might help terrie with her needs and requests in this situation
terrie had never heard of an om buds and asked for clarification about the role
it was clear to the title ix coo rd in at or that goals were to be heard and understood
terrie stated that she wanted her friends to understand how inappropriate the texts were but she want to hurt them or their future plans journal of the international mb uds man association si to be medical doctors
terrie agreed to meet with he om buds and the coordinator called the om buds with terrie in the room
an appointment was made for her then
terrie met with the me the next day and explained her situation in detail including what happened at the party and after the party
asked te if having facilitated conversation with her two friends was what she wanted to happen
terrie stated that she want to get them in trouble but she did want them to listen to her and understand how much they had hurt her and their friendship
he also wanted to make it clear to them that she never wanted them to send her or anybody else inappropriate pictures ever again
with her permission reached out to the two friends separately introduced myself as the om buds and explained that terrie wanted to meet with them in my office
the title ix coordinator had previously explained the role of the om buds to both respondents and that the om buds would be reaching out to them
consequently they were ready for the call
when talked to both friends explained the informal nature of the om buds role and asked both of them if they were willing to meet with me and terrie
made it clear that they could decline the meeting however formal process would most likely be the next step if th ey meet with me
they both agreed to meet with me and terrie
set date to meet with all three of them in my office
it is important to reiterate that as an om buds do not typically facilitate title ix conversations and all title ix cases and led in the past were effectively transitioned to the title ix coordinator
this was an unusual case because the victim terrie want formal process but did want to talk with her friends in safe space
my office provided her with this option
to clarify the om buds informal role confirmed with the title ix coordinator that there would be no record regarding my informal meetings with these individuals
the title ix coordinator understood and confirmed that this was going to be an informal and off the record process
when met with terrie and the respondents first explained few ground rules and stated that terrie would begin the sharing today and that they were going to listen and not interrupt her
in this conversation explained that he male friends would not be defending themselves nor explaining their actions on the night they sent terrie inappropriate pictures
they were there to listen to terrie
did share that they would have an opportunity to answer questions and comme nt at the end of the conversation
also explained that this was confidential process and the conversation was informal and off the record
normally am not this directive when facilitate conversations
always lay out ground rules but this case was little different
while was not going to force the two male friends to be completely silent did feel that it was important that they were not there to defend themselves
they were mostly there to listen to their friend and to bring some rest or at ion to their friendship
my directive approach may have pushed the limits of om buds neutrality or impartiality as expressed in the standards of practice however was willing to take this chance because keeping terrie safe was my priority
the two ma le friends agreed to the ground rules and for the next hour terrie described how she experienced that night and how damaging their actions were to their friendship
terrie was articulate emotional and thoughtful while talking to her male friends
terri male friends sat listened and cried
when terrie was done they both apologized for their behavior on that night and promised her that they would never do anything like that again
it was unique example of how the om buds office can informally and impartially help in title ix cases
often people need safe space to hold confidential and off the record conversations that do not lead to formal resolutions
as an om buds was able to provide safe space to student who wa unwilling to file formal complaint but wanted to be heard and understood
it is my belief that handling this case informally provided resolution for terrie
it was non punitive yet powerful learning experience for friends
journal of the international mb uds man association si
the case that changed almost everything few years ago our started zero tolerance campaign against sexual harassment and sexual violence
at that time had been in my position as director of the ombudsman office for only some months and was still getting my bearings to navigate the co culture
midway in the campaign former employee contacted me woman who had been sexually harassed at work and now wanted to understand how to come forward and report formally
it was the and the promise of justice that this mp lied as well as promise of taking reports seriously and following due process that made her decide to come forward
but immediately there was huge and unsurmountable hurdle the policy about abusive conduct included month time limit for report ing
in other words you must report within months from the moment the incident happened if you report later your grievance would not be heard
that time limit struck me as not quite in line with zero tolerance and simply not good practice of inter justice
not only did the visitor want to report an incident that happened over six years ago by now she was also former employee
this was another unsurmountable hurdle because only current employees could report
furthermore it struck me that for years the visitor had felt it was unsafe to report
by now she had left not only the company but also the industry and combined with the message she had amassed the courage to make the step she had long wished to make
this background ade the years long impact and potential of trauma inflicted on survivors of sexual harassment apparent to me
as our new ombudsman had explained to the leadership that would identify systemic issues and provide upward feedback because that is the strength of our profession to me
we only support individuals dealing with the issues they are facing and coach them in their own ende av ours to do so effectively
we also prevent escalation reoccurrence reputation al harm and damage to more individuals by providing recommendations on how to change systems practices and policies in the company
we are forerunners in creating awareness on issues and trends that the leadership need to act on
ombudsmen need to tell leaders what matters even if they would rather not hear about it
felt that here was exactly such an issue
sexual harassment was not recognized as problem within our company that praises itself for being at the top of the industry
because sexual harassment happen in top rated company right
my strategy to get change the policy needed to be changed
want to limit my role to providing written recommendation and then leave the rest to thoughts and prayers
wanted more to be done for survivors to attain justice wanted systemic change to occur
changing that policy would require more than making recommendation to human resources hr the policy owner
it necessitated more experts more diversity and more disciplines to be involved to write comprehensive policy
was convinced of this because paraphrasing margaret mead doubt that small group of thoughtful committed employees can change the
after thorough research including talking with survivors outside my company brought together colleagues from different professional areas hr investigations diversity inclusion legal security staff support and audit
as an ombudsman could not tell them what to do and therefore explained in what ways the current policy was problematic and why it needed revision
presented them the research my office had conducted with the recommendation to form working group to rewrite and seriously update the policy
then me too happened and several badly ha nd led cases became public
the pressure was on to deliver this new policy
and because different disciplines had included their input it became benchmark policy within the industry
the new policy prompted more offices to work together brought awa renes to managers that sexual harassment existed and lifted the taboo for survivors
indeed the number of visitors to my office with sexual harassment concerns quadrupled
the number of formal sexual harassment cases quadrupled too
journal of the international mb uds man association si fast tracking formal sex harassment reports meant quicker investigations and faster disciplinary measures
senior internal panel was formed by hr investigations legal and the ombudsman office
the purpose of the panel is to quickly tackle issues of sexual harassment discrimination and abuse better protect affected employees and provide recommendations for action in situations of abusive conduct
took the opportunity to explain the ombudsman office terms of reference so the panel would understand and respect my prin of independence confidentiality informality and neutrality which they did without any problem or hesitation
also used my annual report as an opportunity to educate crucial stake holders
in it explained how the company had been unaware if not in denial of the occurrence of sexual harassment
sexual harassment is something we would rather not know happens among us
there was reluctance to face this shadow of an otherwise well functioning and often praised corporation
there was disbelief nd an not me not reaction
found providing stories helped to bring reality closer to home
web site on reporting abuse unfortunately no longer existing which had discovered during my initial research included personal stories of se xu al harassment
these stories were educational because they were imaginable
stories make the topic more human they lift sexual harassment above statistics
there were also collaborative efforts to improve the culture
had learned from investigators that sexual harassment often goes hand in hand with other abusive or even criminal behaviour such as fraud embezzlement and extortion
culture of impunity high stress working environment peer competition for secure jobs and tall or po rate hierarchy can create fertile ground for different forms of abuse
culture like ours that values things should not come at the cost of caring for or looking out for each other and supporting each wellbeing and careers
ore over inequality in treatment hierarchical status contract security and access to justice have been shown to lead to power imbalances which can easily lead to abuse
inequality can stem from different contractual conditions for the same work male dominance racial dominance and hierarchical structures all of which make some of us less important than others
knew reducing the incidence of sexual harassment would require significant cultural change
it would involve looking very hard at the curr en values and behaviours that were endorsed within the corporate culture and determining the nature and the drivers of sexual harassment in the organization
as the ombudsman recommended to dedicate survey solely to sexual harassment harassment and ab use of authority which was subsequently supported by the senior internal panel
this survey provided more insights surfaced the current problems with abuse and most interestingly led to the establishment of corporate structure with the aim to create he necessary cultural change
we are working to cultivate more inclusive work environment free from abuse where employees including managers are aware about sexual harassment have skills and insights to prevent abuse and know what to do about it and where to go for help
what learned about formal reports and informal options imagine an employee who was sexually assaulted by colleague groped pushed against wall or raped after work
the messaging in the workplace is to report what happened and take every report
the employee tries to piece things together and indeed considers reporting
reporting means writing up every detail of what happened and sending the story to generic email address like
through this process the employee is expected to submit very private matter one that perhaps keeps them up at night that brings up many different emotions such as shame doubt and guilt to mostly unknown process and to unknown people
in such processes the employee has no control
had been told of survivors waiting for weeks before hearing something back
then they were told to rewrite everything again into template or they received an email saying they would be contacted it hout being given time line
they wondered what would happen if their report meet the criteria for formal journal of the international mb uds man association si investigation or if an investigation was opened but did not find enough evidence so the case got closed
they wondered why certain witness es were not called or why witness told different story to the investigators
were witnesses afraid to lose their jobs or afraid of retaliation
did they just not find what happened to their colleague to be important enough
going formal is tricky pr oc ess
it requires stamina and patience at time when the survivor probably have much stamina and feels very vulnerable
the messages of and take this very imply that the company cares but the victim is frequently left in the cold
in my organization the reporting process was formerly not as victim centered as it has become
in victim centered process the care and support for the victim are the determining factor in the steps to be taken and the victim decides whether an investigation will take place
even though the process is now more victim centered still hear of instances of supervisors or colleagues implying blame on the victim
there have also been instances where the supervisor was initially understand ing and supportive but then later made decisions that were negative for the career
from other companies have heard the process was dominated by legal staff who ticked the boxes of due process but lacked empathy for the survivor
however if ep or ting bring justice then what is the alternative
providing options for informal resolution is very important
several of my visitors usually women have wanted their male harasser to know how his behaviour had impacted them and they wanted im to understand why it was hurtful
some have wanted reconciliation or an apology
others have wanted the harasser to listen to their story or to hear the harasser explain what brought them to do it
here is where the ombudsman provides the options of med ia ti on facilitation and restorative justice process
when there is safe space for conversation dialogue and listening there is the potential to create learning and very importantly healing
another informal and victim centered option for survivor is the opportunity to deposit their story
this means the survivor provides written report without asking for formal action such as an investigation
instead the survivor asks for the story to be deposited in safe confidential place and to be not if another victim brings forward similar case involving the same perpetrator
with strength in numbers and the chance of finding more evidence the survivor can decide that an investigation be opened
justice is journey and so is change the cha ng es taking place in the organization are encouraging
there is commitment from the leadership to create better workplace dedicated senior post is established and funds are committed to roll out related programme
curbing sexual harassment and ot he abusive conduct is now an important topic and there is improvement in how management are being held accountable
because of the removal of the restrictions for reporting in the new policy more survivors have been coming forward and more managers are co nt acting me as the ombudsman for consultation on how to respond to claims of abuse within their teams
the individual who had sexually harassed my initial visitor appeared to be serial sexual harasser and had also been reported by someone else
this pro the opportunity to my visitor to tell her story to the investigators the same story that started journey of crucial organizational change
it is journey that as ombudsman am glad to continue being part of
om buds sexual harassment narratives stories
confidentiality standards practice acknowledgments am grateful for the opportunity to have guest edited this special issue of the and for the special people who supported and assisted with its production

journal of the international ombudsman association bing ham si the me too movement has made the public aware of reality that om buds know all too well sexual harassment is pervasive problem one that occurs throughout the united states and in every country of the world
steeped in inequitable power relations the problem has long defied efforts to prevent it clair et al
nearly two thirds of the economies have legal protections against it and range of approaches to diminishing it such as policies grievance procedures train in gs and social media campaigns are in use around the globe cobb kuri an world bank group
yet the problem persists impairing psychological and physical health fulfillment productivity and the organizations in which we and learn mcdonald
within the om buds profession and increasingly beyond it we know organizational om buds can be useful resource for assisting people with sexual harassment concerns
many dedicated professionals have devoted their expert is and creativity to bring the om buds role in sexual harassment cases into the light
they have provided legal analysis research studies articles videos web in ars tool kits social media posts conference presentations and more
the international om bud sm an association and related professional associations as well as commentators and researchers have repeatedly explained how and why visiting the om buds office is an appropriate option for people grappling with sexual harassment situations eg dobbin ka lev howard ro we
this is particularly the case when om buds adhere to the standards of practice based in principles of confidentiality informality neutrality and independence berm an pa pp as
however the value of the organizational om buds in addressing sexual harassment is still under recognized
partly because interactions with their visitors are confidential off the record and outside an formal inv es ti ga to and grievance processes as the standards require
remaining confidential while essential to the om buds role and effectiveness complicates the task of raising awareness and understanding of both om buds practices and the value they bring to at ions
professionals who view sexual harassment and its remedies through narrow legal or policy perspective of mandatory reporting and investigation have sometimes misunderstood disregarded or undervalued om buds work
they have not grasped for exam pl that om buds can have an important role in creating the conditions that enable those who have been sexually harassed to come forward with formal complaints
om buds need as many ways as possible to publicly share what they do and why their work is useful in specific circumstances while simultaneously protecting the identities and confidentiality of their visitors and organizations
this special issue of the helps to address these needs
in this special issue anonymous organizational om buds share st of their experiences working with visitors on sexual harassment cases and candidly reflect on their practices
the narratives are educational thought provoking and often intense they reveal and particularize the role challenges and va lu of the organizational om buds in responding to sexual harassment
the collection of stories not only shines light on sexual harassment situations it illuminates range of methods for addressing them
it also illustrates principles and reasoning that de om buds practices and shares lessons learned
the goal of this forum is to elevate understanding reflection and lively discussion about the nature of om buds work both within and outside the profession
twelve experienced om buds submitted stories for the forum and all twelve stories have been published here
the authors are diverse group in terms of gender age ethnicity and location in the world
these authors are all intentionally anonymous
they ha altered or omitted names and other nonessential details as needed to protect the identities of their visitors organizations and other parties
consequently the authors are receiving no public recognition for publishing their stories
the individual ut hors and are the only ones who know their identities and recognize this as both privilege and responsibility
the om buds who contributed stories are due journal of the international ombudsman association bing ham si our wholehearted thanks and appreciation
without their generosity and expertise there would be no special issue at all
the twelve narratives do not of course describe all the possible approaches and methods om buds may use when responding to sexual harassment
for example the stories do not describe use of mediation gad lin or the ne ric ro we
nor do they represent the whole range of sexual harassment situations that are brought to om buds for assistance
however by focusing on one important type of problem sexual harassment through the lens of twelve different experiences the stories provide contex tua liz ed multi angled deep understanding of responses to sexual harassment cases

this special issue arose in the context of narrative theory research and practice eg clair et al
appreciation for the power of narratives to give voice to experiences especially of mar gi na liz ed individuals and groups has flourished in recent decades and especially in the wake of me too
publications broadcasts social media and other forums have enabled victims and survivors of sexual harassment to publicly share their experiences educating their communities about the nature of the problem
one such forum was special issue of the journal of ap pli ed communication research ja cr published in
predating recent surge in social media by over twenty five years ja cr published collection of communication own sexual harassment experiences demonstrating capacity to empower survivors and let their voices be heard eddie wood
that innovative publication in the field of communication was model for this issue of the
many professions have published survey results interviews and stories of sexual harassment experiences written by victims and survivors within their own fields
in contrast the focus of this special issue is not on own experiences with being sexually harassed
however that focus is not meant to imply hat we should complacently assume the om buds profession is harassment free zone
like other professionals om buds may be victims or harassers in their own work places as well as at om buds conferences and training events adams ras ch
in fact the call for papers for this issue drew inquiries from two om buds who were each interested in submitting their own stories as survivors of sexual harassment on the job
as adams and journal of the international ombudsman association bing ham si ras ch advise it is incumbent upon the om buds profession to look thoroughly and establish exemplary sexual harassment policies practices and methods for reporting and receiving support
while our forum is not designed to give voice to sexual harassment survivors the stories may be empowering in different ways
in the context of this anonymous forum the authors were able to publicly share perhaps for the first time their own detailed stories of assisting in sexual harassment cases
these narratives are lived experiences that demonstrate the expertise and ingenuity
however these are not glossy frictionless case studies with always tidy endings intended to make the om buds appear flawless and unflappable
to the contrary the stories reveal the human emotions uncertainties and internal st rug gl es as they help visitors navigate the complexities risks and enigmas that often arise in sexual harassment cases
the narratives also reveal how om buds can empower people who are struggling with sexual harassment situations
responding as an individ to sexual harassment can be fraught with fears uncertainty and stress
power inequities and organizational cultures that tolerate sexual harassment make responding especially dangerous and complex for people whose status and power in the organization are low bing ham bing ham batt ey
many organizations are not perceived as safe or trustworthy places for people to speak openly or publicly about their concerns
and despite an intentions to be fair to all parties many inter impediments dissuade people from seeking and receiving assistance ro we wi lc ox gad lin
however om buds offices serve to eliminate the barriers that deter people from seeking help by offering context where it is safe to come forward ro we bender sky
by guaranteeing confidential off the record environment om buds provide place for their visitors to talk about sexual harassment experiences without fearing they will forfeit privacy lose control over actions taken on their be hal or suffer retaliation
om buds can also help visitors understand the available organizational resources that obligate harasser to cease harassment
direct communication with harasser may be more effective when organizations have clear policies pro ce dures and consequences for wrongdoing that individuals know about and can readily utilize bing ham burl es on bing ham sch erer
om buds follow the standards of practice with all their visitors whether they are victims or survivors ha rasse rs alleged harassers or other parties
bystanders for example may make referrals to the om buds office accompany victim there or visit with the om buds on their own ro we
because om buds may work with parties in all these roles uds develop perspective from which they can better understand individual experiences
regardless of their roles or circumstances an om buds listens to people helps them analyze their situations and reactions supports them in thinking through the ava ila options and implications and provides space for them to express feelings and make decisions about what to do
our collection of narratives may also be empowering to om buds as result of the engagement in reflective practice
reflective pr act ice is learning experience that professionals in variety of fields use to increase their knowledge skills and quality of work
lang for example offers guide to reflective practice for dispute resolution professionals that involves mat ic reflection questioning insight continuous learning and improvement
the practice can occur alone or in reflective practice groups
as the authors in this forum tell their stories they reflect on their communication with visitors and other partie and the reasoning behind their actions and share significant lessons learned
in turn this forum provides the opportunity for readers new aspiring and experienced organizational om buds and others outside the profession to explore the om buds es and reap valuable lessons of their own
journal of the international ombudsman association bing ham si publication of these narratives is not the end of the story
part two of the special issue is yet to unfold
the encourages readers to mull over these narratives discuss them critique them apply what yo learn from them and perhaps most of all use them as data for your own research
part two of the special issue will comprise research studies written by om buds and other researchers who venture to analyze this collection of stories using qualitative quantitative content analysis methods
by identifying and interpreting patterns that emerge across the narratives research can further elucidate organizational om buds work with sexual harassment
hope the narratives in this forum will inspire others as much as they have inspired me
it is useful at the conclusion of any project to reflect on how it could be improved
wish had been able to persuade more om buds to submit stories to this forum including more stories involving male visitors as well as visitors who experienced sexual harassment at the intersections of sexism racism hetero sexism homophobia and other modes of oppression eg bi ag gio ca la fell richardson taylor robe lo cortina et al
future forums of this kind wh eth er focused on sexual harassment or another type of problem should include more narratives portraying more diversity and additional approaches to om buds work

journal of the international ombudsman association si from the editor historical note on the special issue on sexual harassment and discrimination shannon lynn burton editor journal of the international ombudsman association burton si thank you for your interest in the journal for the international ombudsman association special issue on sexual harassment and discrimination part one
also want to start my comments by thanking dr she reen bing ham professor emeritus and former director of om buds services at the university of nebraska at omaha for serving as the guest editor for this issue
her time and dedication in proposing this project and moving it through to completion has been valuable not only for the but for the om buds authors who contributed and for those om buds still examining th eir impact on visitors affected by these concerns and on the institutions that serve as sites of trauma
these stories bear witness to the experiences of both om buds and visitors as they engage in the difficult conversations that may lead towards healing
these twelve stories highlight the multiple ways om buds engage with sexual harassment and discrimination cases
while in different historical moment alice cook the first om buds at cornell university and the first female om buds in united higher education shared an on sexual dis cr imi nation in universities in article in the aa up bulletin
this article is notable as it is presumed to be one of the first of an om buds describing the cases seen related to these concerns
the examples shared in article outline the struggles that many visitors faced in being heard in systems that were not initially created for them
while systems have changed and shifted one can see the precursors of issues om buds still address today and appreciate the ways in which om buds raise systemic con
the field is now almost fifty years beyond this publication and the value of om buds listening to visitors in this space persists
additionally the concerns related to sexual harassment and discrimination have expanded given the sex and gender issue of today as well as the changes in discourse related to local state and federal regulations
as an historian and om buds often reflect on systemic trends not only in the present moment but also in relation to their evolution over the years
give this question what will the om buds impact on concerns related to sexual harassment and discrimination be in another fifty years
alice stories and the stories contained in this special issue are testament to the valuable space om buds old in navigating the complicated power dynamics structures and policies that surround their visitors
as such encourage our om buds colleagues researchers and others to take part in part two of the special issue on sexual harassment and discrimination and analyze this collection of narratives identify themes and patterns across stories and continue to shed light on om buds work in sexual harassment cases

funding acknowledgements the author is particularly grateful to both the international ombudsman association for distributing the survey for this study to their academic members and to the working academic om buds who shared thoughtful intelligent and practical comments in this survey
journal of the international ombudsman association van hoose the purpose of this survey was to gain perspectives from working academic om buds on best practices for campus om buds services in higher education settings
even if professional om buds are employed to staff and run academic om buds offices and services it may require the efforts of non om buds to establish support and funding for creating academic om buds offices or ser vic es
predicament encountered in creating academic om buds offices is that key people needed in roles as initiators or supporters to create fund and utilize the office may not have comprehensive understanding of the meaning of the word and th concept of om buds as practiced in institutions of higher learning
individuals creating the vision and reality of om buds offices and services may be comprised of campus administrators faculty students and community members including state legislators especially for public colleges university systems and campuses

journal of the international ombudsman association van hoose academic om buds may offer alternative conflict re so lu ti on resources for students faculty and staff based upon the code of ethics and the four standards of practice independence neutrality and impartiality confidentiality and informality international ombudsman association
the am eric an bar association aba recently noted that there is wide variation in adherence to the international ombudsman and other professional om buds standards for confidentiality impartiality and independence
furthermore the ba encouraged compliance with those professional standards to promote expansion of organizational om buds offices as informal lines of communication to help with interpersonal and systemic challenges while championing best practices for corporate govern anc american bar association
without independent standing for an om buds office confidentiality impartiality and informality may be less feasible
importantly the perception of conflicts of interest to the organization may undermine visitor tr us in or use of om buds services
specifically multiple roles of an om buds that also include other formal roles of administrator faculty etc

recommends that the om buds office report directly to the highest level of an organization for maximum independence and easiest access to those at the very top of the organization international ombudsman association

people can talk abo ut their issues and about various options informally on spectrum from nothing all the way up to what formal grievance procedures
in the uc merc ed video recording acker said people usually just want to tell their story and kind of see it all laid out
and sometimes people are really hurting they may be afraid of retaliation
so again we protect from those kinds of things so people can feel safe to express themselves
and really preventive service kind of safety valve so we can try to prevent grievances from happening and that people can have positive working learning researching environment
and we from the very beginning have followed the international mb uds association standards of practice and number one is confidentiality
tell anybody who else comes to see me unless perceive an imminent harm of self danger to self or
furthermore acker described how she follows standards of practice
confidentiality unless there is imminent danger to self or others
so report right into the office but tell her who comes to see me and she never asks
so not part of any formal grievance process later be served as witness
every time done with case shred all those records
that really keeps it informal and confidential even if things go differently down the road additionally acker emphasized that do not provide counseling services for mental health kinds of issues those resources exist on the campus for both students and employees
we also provide any legal services or legal
if there is concern and people are not sure what to do about it or they are not sure even who to talk to about it then they can come in and talk about it and get help to figure out different options for how they want to resolve that issue really the goal is to have very positive place where people want to come to work where they want to to study and where they want to come to do uc merc ed

creating and sustaining academic om buds services may improve campus conditions in higher education
this survey of working academic om buds was undertaken to learn how om buds services in higher education currently influence campus disputes on flic ts and issues of concern for students staff and faculty how om buds can be effective in higher education settings and how to identify workable ways to start and sustain academic om buds services for people across academia who could benefit rom such programs
survey design and methods the survey design was in two phases small qualitative pilot study to assess the feasibility of larger qualitative survey study
the small pilot qualitative study was completed in person using journal of the international ombudsman association van hoose six item en gl ish language anonymous paper survey which required to minutes to complete
one demographic question asked if the participant provided om buds services for students staff or faculty
another question used both like rt scale and comment box
th remaining four items were open ended questions on practice issues or on funding strategies for om buds services
the target population for the small pilot study was the working academic om buds who were attending an international conference for campus om buds held november at the as il omar conference grounds in pacific grove california california caucus of college and university om buds th annual conference
eighteen om buds completed the paper surveys which were distributed to all of the approximately workshop participants
based on the thoughtful comprehensive and rich content in the survey responses in the pilot study it was decided that larger number of participants for larger online qualitative study was reasonable
more part would be useful in further focusing and identifying valuable information about real world academic om buds who they are how they work and how they envision creating or sustaining om buds offices at institutions of higher learning
permission to the pilot study and the online study was granted by leadership
the larger qualitative survey study was an electronic duplicate of the same paper survey tool used for the in person pilot survey see appendix
invitations to participate in the ny mo us online survey were emailed by the to active members of the academic sector
the online survey was open from december through january
this study is based upon the online survey results from the online survey who responded which represented survey completion rate of of the people invited to participate
the decision to use only online survey results was made to avoid any duplicate responses from participants who might have also completed an in person survey in november
human subjects protection institutional review board exempt status for this study protocol id was approved from the university of hawaii office of research compliance on october
this research project pos ed less than minimal risk to participants ie no known physical emotional psychological reputation al or economic risk and did not involve any vulnerable population
data analysis qualitative comments from the participants were color coded to more readily identify common themes for responses to each of the survey questions
direct quotations from participant response comments which typified those perspectives of particular theme were selected to be included as exemplars
survey fin dings seventy six academic om buds responded to the online survey
results of this online survey were combined into major themes
five major themes are described and analyzed below as they emerged within the survey responses
the five themes were ident if ie as improving campus functionality dispersing information identifying problems and concerns raising awareness of cost effectiveness and value of services and maintaining and developing professionalism
what best describes your role in om buds service
select all that apply journal of the international ombudsman association van hoose the responses for question the majority of the academic om buds respondents provide services for multiple groups within the academic community
out of the om buds serve st ud en ts serve staff and serve faculty
please describe any convincing reasons for state legislature andor board of regents to approve campus om buds office andor to fund public college and university campus om buds offices five major themes were extracted from the total participant responses to question
almost seventy percent of responses focused on om buds services improving campus functionality related to morale fairness justice communication inclusiveness and team building conflict resolution and productivity
fifty seven percent noted that om buds mitigate and deal with mismanaged conflict early productively constructively and informally and stated that om buds services included preventative process such as providing safe place to be heard identifying problems and recommending campus changes
forty five percent of responses had to do with om buds roles in prevent in consequences when conflict is ignored
some of the major problems om buds felt were mitigated or prevented by academic om buds included lawsuits grievances non productivity and research misconduct of responses focused on om buds dispersing to help others access campus resources preventing public scandals providing whistle blower resource identifying problems and concerns for upper administration and others and addressing school and workplace issues
thirty one percent of es pons es noted that om buds services support communication of diverse stakeholder interests and perspectives inclusiveness neutrality and provisions for safe place for communications
seventeen responses reported cost effectiveness of om buds ser vices as well as value added om buds activities that reduce campus incivility bullying mobbing isolating unethical behavior abuse of power verbal abuse physical abuse and reputation assault
twenty one percent of responses noted that om buds er vices improve campus student retention rates and reduce employee attrition
twenty three percent of responses included improved awareness of trends and compliance concerning faculty institutional system wide and state wide concerns
maintain in and developing professionalism is key to achieving om buds goals congruent with the standards of practice
several responses specifically refer to the standards of practice or to the forum of canadian ombudsman code of et hi cs
the code of ethics defines om buds standards related to independence impartiality fairness confidentiality and credibility
the five main themes found in the survey comments extracted from the comments were improving campus functionality dispersing information identifying problems and concerns raising awareness of cost effectiveness and value of services and maintaining and developing professionalism
these themes concerning om buds functions nd outcomes within the survey responses indicate positive humanistic environmental and economic effects arising from campus om buds services
the positive themes and data here thus support advocating for and creating sustainable independent academic om bud offices at institutions of higher learning
if state legislatures or boards of regents do not journal of the international ombudsman association van hoose mandate or fund om buds services for public academic institution then perhaps the department of education or the us congress might be lobbied to supp or this endeavor
om buds may prevent mitigate and mediate conflict in varied forms
taking systematic approach to focus on organizational causes of conflict and on transforming conflicts and disputes into solutions facilitate strategic positive out com es lip sky
one respondent below discussed how academic om buds services enhance life for people at academic institutions while improving the functionality of an academic institution offices create space in which students can seek consul tat ion when they have questions concerns that institutional systems are not operating as stipulated
institutions can then utilize the trend information and feedback the om buds provides to improve institutional policies processes systems and structures to enhance the institutional
professional om buds skill sets and adherence to the om buds code of ethics and standards of practice allow om buds offices vs
mandated reporters in faculty and staff offices opportunities to use impartiality confidentiality and informality to achieve fairness and justice among individuals and groups in higher education institutions
om buds can act as liaison for and between parties and as an established impartial and neutral in format io source to guide positive changes within academic institutions
this is not duplication of services
comment on how an academic institution benefited from creation of confidential and informal reporting alternative to build trust on campus also bro ug ht up this strategy as one used by peer and may be thought of as an ideal method for improving campus wide trust to improve internal reporting of concerning behaviors or compliance violations
university had many public scandals leading board of trustees to create very robust internal reporting and compliance program
at the same time the trustees also realized that campus stake holders had suffered deep loss of confidence
therefore the trustees decided to al so implement confidential and informal alternative
this also reflected desire to have programs consistent with their peer and aspiration al peer
om buds can help organizations to comply with legal and ethical obligations through work sh ops supportive expertise communications and relevant campus activities for students faculty staff and administrators
mandates from state and federal agencies the courts and acts of congress shape organizational governance
whistle blower protection employment rules and criminal liability protections require effective compliance anti discrimination and anti harassment policies and procedures non retaliatory complaint reporting and enforcement mechanisms as well as anti discrimination and ant training programs howard
economic benefits of campus om buds services were mentioned in seventeen question responder comments and one response provided detailed example cost of conflict for an organization can be sign if ic ant in lost productivity paid time off and hours of all employees involved including management and potentially legal
the industry average is about hours per employee month
depending upon the size of your organization this can be quite high
example average salary of hr hour employees mo month or annually and this is conservative based on low salary
as such it is important to establish non disciplinary resource for the resolution of internal on flic ts in productive and timely
journal of the international ombudsman association van hoose the complexity of all academic campuses is an important trait addressed by the following comment are unique environments that involve interactions between subsystems that do not always share th same goals and values
communication across subsystems can therefore be challenging and marked by conflict
the ombudsperson om buds can use informal processes to move quickly between subsystems to facilitate resolutions to problems that would norm all require an investment in time and energy
additionally quick resolution can help to avoid the use of formal grievance
focused on individual group and unit needs this next response described how om buds help others by to all ons ti tu en ts zero barrier office completely safe place to discuss concerns and good ideas
this is especially important if there otherwise are mandatory reporting rules
serving all constituents all ranks all geographical units targets by stan de rs alleged offenders etc
means the om buds can pick up new issues before they are big
finally in acknowledging that actions often speak louder than words the following response stated that om buds and serve as role model in how to deal with difficult situations conflict change systemic movement on campus and the
the next section below describes ideas for funding or creating om buds offices
some of the ideas include ways to insulate om buds offices from budge ta political and ethical pressures
please describe any ideas for funding campus om buds services or for mitigating expenses without placing faculty administrators or other employees in positions where ethical power imbalances or con flic ts of interests might arise from dual roles there were total participant responses to question
thirty percent of responses focused on how om buds services pay for themselves in terms of value in preventing costly problems
twenty per ce nt of responses suggested funding by student fees or collective pool of funds
seventeen percent of responses emphasized the importance of not funding om buds from any one department to maintain independence
eight of the participants did not respond to this question and seven of the responses were
there was an even split among the responses that suggested using or condemned using dual roles part time om buds hours with part time other faculty or staff roles hours
six responses suggested charging for outside community or state services that an om buds office might take on such as fundraising activities grants donations or endowments
lastly four responses suggested state funding nd one said they had state funding
the concept of cost savings was noted often such as in the following response the cost offset following the establishment of om buds offices that is do legal and risk claims decrease following the establish me nt of an om buds office
this may require year follow up as the benefits may not arise in the near term
journal of the international ombudsman association van hoose measuring cost effectiveness and return on investment may not provide clear view of om buds and program value
quality assurance and im prov em will require ongoing evaluation and planning to ensure that missions goals and activities are consistently reviewed and updated based upon outcomes and feedback
sch en ck and suggested aligning embedding and integrating om buds act iv it that maximize om buds and program contributions so that people in the organization become aware of the full humanistic and economic documented value of those contributions
another participant noted that om buds offices pay for themselves very ui ck ly
assessments conducted by john of pacifica human communications an expert on om buds program performance metrics demonstrate that for every invested in an om buds program between and of value is returned to the organization
the concept of om buds services and salaries not coming from single department to help maintain the independence of om buds was articulated by three responses such as it would be best to align an ombudsman salary to be dispersed directly from discretionary pool out of admin
finance not specific department such as hr or the president provost office
this would lend credibility to the misconception of influence by particular
student fees were funding source for some campus om buds services
also using collective fund from multiple budgets or sources was proposed the function from collective pool of
another response suggested that major ec tor should contribute to community pot of funds available for the om buds
another participant felt that those who serve faculty staff and students consider whether half the salary can be paid through existing student fees
sharing the expense may signal that the om buds doesnt to any one
there were caveats to the responses that suggested using dual roles to help finance om buds services om buds office is currently staffed by tenured full professor who does not carry out teaching duties while in the role
the om buds reports to the president rather than to the chair of her home dept
the fact that the om buds is tenured full professor enhances the independence of the of fi
problem solving for dual role conflicts of interest included have multiple collateral appointments in which conflicts of interest are handled by the other om buds choosing someone not in role which makes decisions about policy grade etc
ideally it needs to be ft full time independent
one response suggest ed moving funding from other roles or departments om buds function best works when it operates independent of other responsibilities
and it best operates with level of independent authority so as not to create power imbalances
if it is not feasible for it to be funding as new position consider transfer rin funding from other roles or departments within the
journal of the international ombudsman association van hoose the idea of creating one or more endowed om buds chairs at an academic institution would insulate them from pressures from the budgetary concerns
also an endowed chair role as opposed to department chair role is inherently more independent with fewer institutional assigned duties or political or personal pressures subject to de funding or punitive position elimination
response comment noted that small and per haps any school creating an endowed chair for the om buds would further identify the office as separate clearly independent within the institution
one funding idea seek personal contributions for the endowment from attorneys in area who are members of the american bar association strong supporter of
local attorney was pleased to hear that our campus had an om buds and think might help fund
an alternative idea is having an academic om buds office be part of the state government as part of an existing state om buds office with separate section of multiple academic om buds who serve all public academic institutions
this could be good idea for number of reasons
first their position and office would not be reliant on academic inst it uti on al budgets
second the om buds offices could more easily be compliant independent impartial neutral confidential and informal by not being part of or subject to pressures from the academic institutions they serve
third in the case of conf li ct of interest another om buds from the state om buds office could take over the case
downside could be in serving more than one campus or institution lesser familiarity with the needs resources and accessibility could hinder efficacy services nd satisfaction
these are factors to consider when reading the two respondent comments below there should be an independent organization which provides om buds services to universities on retainer basis
sort of staffing agency which would retainer andor per case fee so students could have access to the services true neutrality could be maintained and the university would have the opportunity to see the value of the
collaboration on regional level or state level is thy of consideration an ombudsman om buds role could be established through state agency paid through the agency and assigned to any organization that does business in the state
consortium for participation in the program could be est abl is hed where standardized dues are paid to participate that can offset some or all of the expense incurred by the state agency where the salary benefits are being
the above concept is reality for another participant who described the ar ra ng eme nt below in favor of om buds that are independent contractors because it enhances the appearance of independence and neutrality disclosure that is how my role exists and think that funding for om buds can easily be shared crowd sou rc ed if you will among multiple campuses
serve as an om bud for day per week at one university and on project or basis on other campuses which allows for multiple institutions to share the cost and alleviates the need for full time position nd the costs associated with
in your opinion how could campus mental health counselor psychologist lawyer social worker or graduate student with special training experience in mediation negotiation and alternative dispute re sol uti on also effectively function as part time impartial and journal of the international ombudsman association van hoose confidential campus om buds
if you do not think that this is possible why do you feel that it is not possible
there were total participant responses to question
fifty six percent of resp on indicated that it is either not possible or not advisable to effectively function as part time impartial and confidential campus om buds with another campus role
nearly of responses indicated that this was possible but usually wit caveats
sixteen percent of responses felt that graduate students should not work as om buds
the majority of responses extracted for question expressed the opinion that non om buds different part time role on campus would not be feasible or advisable for an effective impartial and confidential part time campus om buds
the rationales provided for this varied do not believe that complies with the spirit of the standards of pr act ice
wearing more than one hat automatically undermines independence and
another respondent specified several down sides related to dual roles think possible because that person would not be independent or impartial and confidential
also this person would not be able to effectively tell leaders harsh realities when they have other roles grades or income at risk
this model of om buds suggested leaves too many possibilities for power struggles and potential re tali at io when truth telling is part of the
incongruities between dual roles may also jeopardize non om buds roles american psychological association and typically licensure require that psychologists avoid multiple formally dual relationships with clients
serving as both om buds and psychologist would violate professional standards and ethics and would not be
dual roles may also confuse community members who utilize services possible because the provider is wearing multiple oles hats and community members may not be able to distinguish the
one om buds participant noted both overlapping and incompatible professional expectations for om buds roles vs
attorney roles am licensed attorney however do not work for the university as an attorney do not give legal advice
my prior experience practicing in employment law and higher education law provides me with skill set and legal understanding to spot issues with the visitors to the om buds office
however to be impartial and confidential could never have dual role as the attorney and the om buds
the attorney has legal and ethical duty to their client the university and therefore could never be truly impartial or confidential with visitor to the om buds office
furthermore the om buds role is somewhat of professional coach not therapist or counselor
if visitor needs mental health services help them find those services but the om buds not breach that boundary
to do so would make the om buds an advocate for the visitor and not an advocate for fairness
the need to be impartial requires the om buds to advocate only for fairness and not to advocate for cause issue person group depa rt ment etc
all the other options professions listed in your question require the om buds to take side and journal of the international ombudsman association van hoose om buds need to be very very careful to not get pulled into one side of an issue
furthermore if someone has dual role as social worker om buds then if an issue arises within their department where they are the social worker then they cannot be the om buds for anyone in that department including any
other responders felt that dual role was possible but often with provisions is possible if they are recused from any situations where they may have conflict of
and would only work if the om buds was completely transparent about conflicts of interest and avoided those cases
an additional om buds with different on flic ts would help
in addition clear delineation between the two roles would be important different web sites office spaces phone and email etc
also strong policies about confidentiality are
there were several different reasons why so me participants felt that graduate students should not work as om buds also dont believe that anyone in student capacity will work as an om buds either because it is best to have professional who is employed by the institution in the
another participant felt that just do not know the culture sufficiently to explore options with
with the perspective of seeing graduate students as vulnerable population pertinent comment was that would not recommend that graduate student serve in the role
they would not be in position to be
lastly response stated appropriate for student level of institutional knowledge experience and comfort with all kinds of personal trauma conf li ct and professional concerns that it would be hard to imagine coping with that as
would or year rotation away from campus teaching or evaluation roles during om buds service eliminate most conflicts of interests
twenty one percent selected the like rt scale options of or that or year rotation away from campus teaching or evaluation roles would eliminate most conflicts of interests during the om buds role
twenty nine percent selected agree or disagree
the question survey responses indicate that rotating out of campus teaching or evaluation roles during om buds ser vice is viewed by most responders as not eliminating most conflicts of interests during academic om buds service
comments included be hard for faculty staff to return to previous roles given the confidential aspects of the role
not impossible but om eth ing to
and individuals knowing that return to those roles is imminent the visitors may not feel that their issues are truly
also is hard to move away from relationships you have
even more so to be objective wh en you know you will be going back to those
another perspective was that do believe that is best to have an om buds that is in the position long term
rotating out every few years impacts the continuity of the office and
journal of the international ombudsman association van hoose sentiments that pre existing bias from former campus roles were issues that concerned some respondents temporary suspension negate long term relationships that might give rise to potential conflict and jeopardize
another person com ment ed that would also be helpful to bring someone in that has no connection to the university
another respondent touched on the complexities involved with conflicts of interest most vital element in freeing an om bud and their of conflicts of interest is their own personal integrity and scrupulous fidelity to their role function
rotation period but would not insulate anyone ultimately from bias or the bleeding of interests
only deeply held faith fu ln es to the code of ethics and stubborn refusal to be influenced by power either feared or held can neutralize potential conflicts of
professionalism in the om buds role is integral to development of and quality improvement in undergraduate and graduate education internships and research opportunities to prepare upcoming generations for meaningful accomplishments as om buds
one respondent expressed the following related opinions the office of om buds is going to get the respect it de serves it needs to be treated as an actual occupation
om buds should have appropriate training and credentials and then need to be tireless advocates for the value of the office
having part time people or treating this as an additional assignment will no help to build
while licensure is not required for an om buds role certification is available
it is not difficult to imagine licensure certification or ongoing continuing education requirements emerging in the near future on state or other level
one participant commented think om buds should be technically trained in all conflict intervention models and an outsider
most insiders know the culture and already have relationships that can hinder the independent perspective of visitors
and ombudsman should be trained in conflict coaching executive coaching mediation conflict analysis conflict resolution systems design and analysis qualitative and quantitative data analysis stakeholder assessments and have emotional

provide your comments here there were responses to question that did not consist only of na none or no
for comments to question there were comments focusing on the importance of role training and independence of academic om buds the higher education om buds model believe that the om buds should be direct report to the leadership of the institution
truly feel that they should be accessible to all students faculty and staff
and feel that their annual reports for policy changes should always be considered to create collaborative community
also feel that whistle blower policy should also be in place for those who bring egregious cases
the above comment on accessibility to om buds services and collaborative community building is thought provoking
according to con be re organizational om buds are both part of alternate non adversarial dispute resolution systems to reduce litigation as well as part of conflict journal of the international ombudsman association van hoose management systems proactive systems to improve collaboration morale productivity and retention
conflict management systems should attempt lo early resolution not society of professionals in dispute resolution nd
om buds offices can play important roles for all five ha ra ct eristics of an effective integrated conflict management system as identified by the society of pro fess ion als in dispute resolution which include
providing options for all types of problems and all people in the organization
creating culture that welcomes dissent and encourages resolution of conflict at the lowest level through direct negotiation
people can readily identify and access knowledgeable person whom they trust for advice about the conflict management system
providing multiple options both rights based and interest based for addressing conflict
providing systemic support and structures that coordinate and support the multiple access points and multiple options and that integrate effective conflict management into the organizations daily operations eleven comments on campus dual roles of part time om buds took perspective aligned with the following comment that work on difficult issues and tell people things they dont want to hear all the time
rotation away from other duties to be an om buds would not be effective as just having an independent om buds because people in academia have long memories
the fear of retaliation down the line would be strong and would prevent an om buds from being effective in reporting on trends advocating for policy
discussion the survey findings support the transformative mediation model as described by fol ger and bush on individual group and institutional levels
the transformative mediation model is somewhat difficult to define in str ic sense
it is more of an attitude and dialogue by the mediator used to transform the dialogue between the parties from weak self absorbed negative destructive alienating demonizing downward spiral to strong responsive positive constructive connecting humanizing upward spiral
effectively this can change the nature of conflict interaction through empowerment and recognition between the clients
these transformative mediation model themes are similar to what om buds standards of practice are all about in evoking positive client driven solutions with their clients
what this study brings into the model is specific to om buds and handful of other professionals
there is the important factor of the visitor to the that is central part of the findings in this study
indeed most survey comments related to dual position part time om buds concerns were focused on visitor trust confidentiality and potential conflicts
other comments spoke to the nee for om buds educated andor licensed in counseling law or some other professions staying within the boundaries of om buds standards of practice and acceptable activities such as providing informal confidential impartial help to discuss complaints or disputes arising from incidents or issues concerning policies students faculty employees and others helping identify options for resolution imparting information on options for other college and university services or programs assisting individuals or groups to confidentially raise concerns and work toward responsible systemic change
the above activities are very different than key activities in some other professional roles
to avoid compromising the journal of the international ombudsman association van hoose om buds role staff in an om buds off ice should not make records of consultation content or parties or provide notice of the content of consultations to the college or university provide psychological counseling duplicate other campus services or breach confidentiality ex cep in the very rare instance of imminent threat of serious harm
graphical representation of the transformative mediation model as applied to this survey findings is presented in figure
the transformative mediation model applied to the academic om buds survey results limitations and streng this survey included reasonably large number of participants who provided many thoughtful evidence based and practical responses learned from professional experience and knowledge
other questions and prompts might have resulted in responses with other foci to the responses given
the questions used were created from an the author is not an om buds but the author is very interested in helping create om buds services on the university campus where they work
the outsider perspective has value since the survey answered questions that were the upper most concerns to bring before students staff faculty administration and legislators
another study from an perspective would likely have other questions and prompts and bring fo other information
conclusions this study explored needs benefits and pitfalls associated with creating and maintaining om buds offices and services on college and university campuses from the perspectives of working academic om buds
the knowledge ga in ed from this study may be used in decision making by existing programs and by academic institutions and state legislators when considering the maintenance or creation of academic om buds services
services getting the visitor to the define their own issues recognition of concerns and enabling the parties to seek solutions on their own based upon their goals resources options and preferences empowerment via information campus environment promoting self actualization transforming the campus community journal of the international ombudsman association van hoose the fact that only about ten percent of academic ins ti tu ti ons in the united states have om buds services leaves much room for positive change higher ed colleges and universities directory of om buds offices national center for educational statistics
money spent on legal costs lawsuit settle men ts and arbitration could be saved with less expensive alternatives of non adversarial dispute resolution methods such as those practiced by om buds
access to om buds services at the lowest initial level of visitor contact vs
filing grievance or laws uit helps to produce win win solutions to conflicts within academic institutions while defusing and solving conflicts in non adversarial ways
academic institutions communities and cultures could infuse and incorporate non adversarial techniques for add re ssing conflicts at all levels through om buds supported activities
promoting ethical beneficial non discriminatory and empathetic interpersonal interactions within academic institutions by raising awareness and improving individual and group skills in communications civility and fairness are examples of effective om buds services
people working and learning in positive environments become happier and more satisfied
the institution keeps and attracts the best students staff faculty and administrators
this in turn enhances the reputation of the institution
the most important ut come is that people who benefit from contact with professional om buds will go out into the rest of the world educated in skills and techniques learned from the om buds fostered academic culture to influence and change the rest of the world for the bet te that is an idea with merit particularly now in the united states
now when escalating discord from pandemic related stress covid vaccination issues facial mask and social distancing controversies are sources of conflict
now when health and eco nomic disparities have taken serious and even deadly physical and psycho social tolls on people especially upon the most disadvantaged or vulnerable among us
now when voting rights laws and other political issues have polarized and divided many groups
indeed now it is time for collaboration and non adversarial means to bring people of the world together to solve current pandemic climate environmental social and economic crises for the betterment of all

collaboration faculty leader sh journal of the international ombudsman association farmer in bridges not blockades transcending university politics editors gay le ma dd ox and martha die de compile essays from contributors who consider range of ways in which strife manifests itself on college and university campuses
the essays suggest how campus constituents can do their part to work on transcending wh at divides us
contributions are generally inspired by the personal experiences of the authors themselves and while om buds offices are largely absent from the discussions practicing om buds will certainly find the importance of their role to be an unspoke constant of the book
the opening chapters in the volume offer an overview of some ways in which the metaphor that informs the title can be applied to the world of higher education
in chapter ma dd ox reviews litany of po liti cal challenges currently facing american colleges and universities and with reference to famed fiddling while rome burned concludes that the internal arguments overtaking much of academia only serve to distract us from the dangers lurking be yond campus
it should be noted that while the introduction focuses on the american political context the general collaborative principles underlying the volume also make it potentially useful resource for om buds practicing in the international higher ed arena
chapter by betty block elaborates on the metaphor of university as organism with each part needing to be intricately connected to the other in order to sustain the homeostasis of the living whole
similarly in chapter anita fi hen ck reflects on the many roles that she has held at universities over the years one of which she mentions very much in passing was om buds and concludes that through bridge has been central to most individual and inst it uti on al
the next cluster of chapters in the book offers examples of stake holders at the respective institutions who have worked to build bridges while fighting for and upholding key moral standards
chapter by andrew adams focuses on the evolution of the american association of university stance on certain issues over the decades putting particular emphasis on policies related to discrimination and collegiality
in chapter mel an ie springer mock reflect on her experiences as journalism professor and student newspaper adviser who has had to navigate the tensions between the leaders and student reporters are willing to call out would rather quash dissenting voices th an let the truth be
in chapter two western carolina university faculty members murphy nu gen and charm ion rush two former students oak ley jr and carle en ten ae turner discuss history of concerns about racial dis crim in at ion on their campus that led to faculty student collaboration and the founding of the whee matter movement
if chapters through focused on group advocacy the next set of contributions revolves more around the ways in which individual faculty me mb ers particularly ones who are new to the academy can focus on building bridges
chapter by elwood watson offers list of dos and that new faculty members should be aware of as they navigate relationships on campus
martha contribution in chapter meanwhile focuses on the ways in which strong partnerships across campus can make all the difference when it comes to pursuing tenure
and in chapter spouses drew and emily virtue look at strategies that academic couples facing the two body problem can use to search for employment opportunities that will meet both of their needs as well as the ways in which dual career hiring programs and policies can strengthen the universities that implement them
as the volume nears its conclusion the next triad of articles looks at bridge building less from the perspective of faculty and more from that of leadership
in chapter steve est es examines the qualities in academic leaders ie
administrators that generally make them successful in heading up the faculty
then laura pipe who heads unc teaching innovations office writes about the importance of collaboration across campus for the success of her unit
in chapter rochelle ford dean of elon university school of communications journal of the international ombudsman association farmer discusses the key role that listening showing empathy and demonstrating respect for all members of the campus community have played for her in her own path to becoming leader
as she puts it mutually beneficial relationship has helped me to excel as higher education leader at multiple
the final chapters take things back in more general direction with insights relevant to all those who work on university campus
david chapter looks at bridge building in the context of professional development and in their final chapter the editors conclude with takeaway of the tenets that they consider essential for navigating university politics
these include the ideas that empathy is crucial that there are real human beings behind every job on campus that context matters and that forgiveness is essential because everyone makes mistakes
one piece of advice in the final paragraph almost sounds as though it could have come fro an om buds brochure can give ourselves time to process tough situations and circumstances
few people turn down requests for little time to consider our options before providing
somewhat striking that book focused on bridge building in academia makes basically no mention of the good work that om buds offices do in that area but perhaps not that surprising
after all many of the contributors are from western carolina university whose om buds program was sho rt lived
had the program lasted perhaps the om buds as university bridge builder would have made more of an appearance in the book
that said om buds who are new to working in higher education may find useful this overview of some of the sorts of on flic ts typical in that arena
where bridges may strike some om buds particularly more experienced om buds as occasionally problematic is in its tendency at certain points to prescribe rather generic rather than to acknowledge the complex pow er structures at play in many conflicts on campus
one emphasis on civility for example elides the oft problematic history behind that term which was recently explored among other places in alex against civility the hidden racism in our obsession with civility
the bridges closing emphasis on forgiveness similarly espouses one size fits all approach to difficult situations that many om buds would likely hesitate to endorse given their emphasis on helping vi si tors find the best path for themselves
that said any book that can help om buds promote the need for campus space focused on building bridges helping others learn to do so be seen as welcome addition to the field
om buds will certainly find common ground with many of the people represented in the essays whether the student journalists speaking truth to power the academic couple working toward creative solutions to challenging problem or the dean who believes in the power of listening showing empathy and demonstrating respect

history document analysis conference proceeding journal of the international ombudsman association smith introduction in the fall of and again in the spring of people from across the united states gathered to discuss an idea that had recently been implemented in institutions of higher education
the om buds concept was so new that many did not have name for it they struggled to define it and the opportunity to discuss how it could be used to alleviate some of the pressures that institutions of higher education were facing was welcomed
these two gatherings some of the first organized on the topic of the mb uds in the united states and the first organized around om buds in education provided significant contributions to the theoretical foundations of the om buds role and ultimately the greater om buds profession
the first of these conferences took place in october of at the university of detroit and the second took place in may of at the hy att house hotel in burling ame california both organized by an organization called higher education executive associates of detroit
the second conference was cosponsored by the institute for local government and public service at chico state college and the ombudsman foundation of angeles
participants of both gatherings came from across the united states and included mix of practitioners scholars higher education administrators and skeptics
conference proceedings were compiled from these two gatherings and published under the title the ombudsman in higher education advocate or subversive bureaucrat and catalogued in the education resources inform at ion center eric database
the proceedings consist of separate papers including published manuscripts papers presented at the and conferences as well as additional conference reflections and reports written by early om buds
when viewed as collection the ombudsman in higher education presents fascinating glimpse into the ideas thoughts and debates of these early practitioners and scholars of
some of these early debates will resonate with contemporary om buds and some show how the field has evolved since these early days
the ombudsman in higher education is also unique in the fact it serves as an intellectual cornerstone of contemporary om buds practice and research
while this document has not been heavily cited in om buds research it should be widely read by those who want to understand the genesis
this paper will review and analyze the conference proceedings in four parts
first the four papers presented in will be taken together followed by the papers which will also be analyzed together
the previously published articles will be discussed as they would have provided background for conference participants
this will be followed by brief discussion of themes and take aways as well as im pli cat ions for contemporary om buds practice and research
background the united states and much of the world were captivated by the om buds concept in the middle of the th century
while the first ombudsman was established in sweden in it was not until subsequent om buds offices were created in norway and denmark that the idea began to take off globally
charles ascher used the term ombudsman ia to describe the global omentum around the om buds concept ascher
one us commentator labeled ombudsman as the word of the year in and publishers in the late had to double check to ensure their dictionaries contained the term row at
the first ma gathering devoted to the om buds idea in the us was the thirty second american assembly held in october of discussing the idea of the american ombudsman
this convention resulted in the text ombudsmen for american government
edited by stanley nd ers on
subsequent regional for the sake of consistency the term om buds will be used when referencing the role
ombudsman or ombudsmen will be used in quotations or historical references
journal of the international ombudsman association smith gatherings followed
these gatherings and resulting documents explored the adoption of the om buds model to the united states and its incorporation into federal state and local government structures anderson
this sa me period saw dramatic unrest on college campuses across the united states because of cultural change the civil rights movement the vietnam war increased organizational complexity and campus bureaucracy smith
many universities were desperate or solutions and looked to the om buds idea to resolve some of the disputes and grievances being presented by students
the first university om buds office in north america was established at simon fraser university in followed by offices at eastern mo nt ana university in stony brook university michigan state university and san jose state college by smith
this momentum and increased interest in the idea of campus om buds paved the way for these gatherings
the campus om buds con fere were organized by higher education executive associates of detroit he ea founded by dr thomas emmett in to provide consulting services to institutions of higher education throughout the united states
prior to founding he ea dr emmett served as the dean of men at the university of detroit and would later spend years as the special assistant to the president at reg is university in denver colorado
he ea would ultimately merge with steve ns strategy in steve ns strategy nd thomas em me obituary
in october of he ea sponsored the first gathering at the university of detroit now the university of detroit mercy entitled the ombudsman concept in higher education
four papers from the institute were included in the proceedings
two papers were presented by practicing om buds one at michigan state university and another san jose state college
additional papers included one written by dean of students re pre sent ing apprehension to the idea and another exploring the theoretical foundations of om buds in higher education
separate paper presented by university of detroit ombudsman thomas davis entitled campus troubleshooter the ombudsman was not included the proceedings rowland
the om buds concept was gaining substantial traction across the united states especially in california institutions which prompted second conference on the west coast
this conference saw additional papers from pr act icing om buds in california as well as public policy scholars and practitioners who framed the college and university om buds in contrast to existing classical models
the second conference was co sponsored by the institute for local government and public er vice at chico state college and the ombudsman foundation of angeles and followed attempts at the creation of an om buds for the state of california
papers at the second conference were presented by practicing om buds as well as scholars and policy ma kers
the detroit conference the first gathering in detroit took place october of at the university of detroit
the university of detroit had also appointed its own om buds in april of the same year
four of the five papers presented were inc lud ed in the conference proceedings paper presented by the om buds at the university of detroit was not included
james rust and benton white some of the first practicing om buds in the united states both presented papers that were mostly operational
they discussed their orientation to the role and how they have come to educate the dates listed in the conference proceedings do not necessarily align and this may be the result of an editorial error
while most of the dates are accurate the speeches given by kell cher norman and sand ler are listed as may of when they should read may of
the conference was held in october while the conference was held in may
other papers also reference the act that these were presented in
lastly dissertation written by roland lists presenters from the conference as clifford davis rust schloss berg and white roland
journal of the international ombudsman association smith themselves on the work
both rust and white had served as om buds for less than year at this point and although they were new to the work themselves they were already ser vi ng as resources for other institutions interested in exploring om buds for their own campuses rust
the roles at michigan state and san jose state were notably different
where the michigan state university om buds leaned on classical models the san jose model was developed with the purpose of rooting out discrimination especially racial discrimination rust white
analysis of rust stated that he participated in both the detroit and the san francisco meetings wh ere he walked away as almost lonely voice expressing the view that the chief function is to serve individual students in distress not to be leader of campus drives for transforming the rust quoted in burton
nancy schloss berg higher education scholar framed the om buds as someone who could become vehicle for peaceful transformation and change within higher education stating that through functional analysis of the higher education bureaucracy we see that the individual is in powerless position on every campus
this argument thus far is crucial to my understanding and discussion of ombudsmen
what is needed is systemic change that is new agent in the educational bureaucracy to humanism th edge over to give power and weight to the individual to redress the asymmetrical balance between person and institution schloss berg
schloss berg considered size and inherent power imbalances as justification for the implementation of om buds roles
schloss berg predicted significant growth in the field and while noting that it may not address the demands presented by it can serve the individual student by helping to overcome bureaucracy an alleviate power imbalance schloss berg
earle clifford the dean of student affairs from rut gers university was skeptical of the om buds idea representing the perspective of student personnel administrators those tasked with supporting students outside of the classroom space
clifford began his remarks by stating perhaps it is because am weary of perhaps it is because am about losing my job to the competition perhaps this is just one conference too many
whatever the reason it is probably in order for me to go on the record at the outset of these comments as unimpressed with the potential or promise of an ombudsman on the higher education scene clifford
clifford took affront the emergence of university om buds
he stated that decision to go the ombudsman route is fine advertisement for the failure of an administration in general or student personnel program in particular to meet responsibilities for equity and com munic at ion in an academic and went on to compare the creation of an ombudsman role to penny in the fuse box when circuit has clifford serving as quick and temporary fix for deeper issues
clifford saw the role of the om buds as threat to that of student personnel work and suggested that current administrators should be working to identify issues that students are facing rather than adding more staff to handle problems
these concerns were presented at time change for universities and for the nature and scope of student personnel work
ultimately cautions were effective and likely representative of the fears of others in university administration
beck reviewed participant notes and followed up with interviews of conference attendees who stated that the of the detroit ombudsman convention adopted and attitude and were significantly impressed by dean
journal of the international ombudsman association smith the burling ame conference many early om buds programs emerged in the state of california and there was likely strong interest in the role from these institutions
the burling ame conference authors represent more diversity in terms of background scholarship and prof es si on
this allowed them to consider the om buds concept more holistically providing greater analysis of the concept in relation to parliamentary models even reflecting on the push to create an om buds for the state of california
the proceedings contained four papers from the burling ame conference and two additional reflections written by attendees
the tone of the papers from the second gathering when taken as whole are markedly different than papers from the first conference
three papers were writ te by university om buds but where the detroit papers were more reflections on their personal experiences with the role the burling ame papers were more rooted in the academic disciplines two political scientists and one historian
the fourth pap er which was titled the ombudsman in government implications for higher education reflected on attempts to pass om buds legislation in the state of california and discussed higher education om buds through legislative or classical lens
ake sand ler was faculty member at cal state angeles and professor of political science
nelson norman taught history at san diego state university
both served as om buds at their respective institutions and discussed the operational aspects of the om buds role as well as through disciplinary lenses
the conference proceedings contained two works by norman one was paper presented at the conference the second like the piece published by james rust at michigan state university provided blueprint and gu ida for other institutions interested in creating an om buds role
ake sand ler was scholar of swedish politics and contrasted the campus om buds role with classical models
the most impactful presenter at the burling ame conference was dr randy hamilton who taught public administration at university of california berkeley
hamilton referenced the wide embrace of the om buds concept citing term ombudsman ia also referring to himself and other conference participants as ombudsman ia cs
conf id enc is the of the om buds according to hamilton
because of this hamilton argued that the om buds role should not be for just one population of the university but should work with every constituency
faculty members for example will see st only om buds as student advocate and vice versa hamilton
sherman beck in his introduction to the conference proceedings noted that dr speech was the outstanding presentation of the conference beck
the conference proceedings also included two reactions by conference participants sherman beck and jerry kell cher one supportive of the role and another less so
beck noted that participants had either attended or read the proceedings from the first confer en ce and that there was sense of community forming around the topic
beck also makes an important distinction by noting that participants felt that the classical om buds role was for use in higher education but that whatever approach was taken for college and university om buds should be rooted in theory beck
jerry kell cher high school teacher and graduate student at chico state college provided more cynical analysis of the proceedings stating best this meet in was called to legitimatize the office of the ombudsman to the administrative hierarchy of various universities and colleges
at worst it resembled an attempt to incorporate pharmaceutical house designed to pass off its would be customers li stimulant as cure for bleeding kell cher
critiques reflected those of from the conference where he criticized the om buds role as an additional bureaucratic layer in response to too much bureaucracy journal of the international ombudsman association smith pointing out an inherent contradiction of the om buds role
kell cher closes his two page reaction with the following rhetorical question did write this paper
probably because have grown accustomed to rules that do not make sense reflection the kell cher
published articles and early writings the conference proceedings also included two additional essays both published prior to the conference
these writings are important to consider as very little had been about academic om buds ing at this time and these articles likely provided much of the grounding for discussions had by conference participants
early om buds looked to scholarship on parliamentary models especially the writings of stanley anderson wa lt er gell horn and the first danish ombudsman stephan when establishing their offices and professional orientations
these essays were some of the first that considered or explored the om buds role in higher education
claudia authored om buds man new troubleshooter on campus published in college and university business
in this article chronicled five om buds at su ny stony brook michigan state university and san jose state college
this article discussed rust and white as well as the stony brook model which utilized three faculty members who shared the role
the first being the reason for their establishment noting that the emergence of the five ombudsmen and the probability more is an attempt to answer the overt and sometimes violent expressions of protest by both student and faculty groups
in the midst of racial strife in loco parentis rebellion disorientation and expansion there is need for sympathetic listener with powers of referral on the campus
each of the five ombudsmen was appointed in response to this need but as result of different problem situations
also identified what an om buds did outlining an om buds powers of inquiry negotiation and persuasion
article signaled strong interest and forecasted growth in the role
noting that all three campuses profiled had planned to expand the role ended by stating scope of expansion is positive indication that the experiment of was not only successful but valuable to the extent of establishing precedent for other institutions of higher
the om buds role would go on to expand rapidly numbering between and offices across the united states by bottom
the second article an ombudsman for the university was published in the journal of college personnel in march of by sand ler kirk and hall berg all at california state college at angel es
sand ler an om buds and faculty member would later go on to present paper at the burling ame conference
in making the case of university om buds the authors stated that establishment of state university ombudsman would bridge the chasm often existing between student faculty and administrators for the mutual benefit of all sand ler kirk hall berg
additionally the authors highlighted the fact that because each university is unique the role will differ from cam pu to campus but that the underlying purpose would be to the obvious and pressing need for an agent representative defender of the individual within the system and the academic sand ler kirk hall berg
both article were prescient providing great analysis of the role its challenges and future
today each om buds role is unique and reflects their institution their structure and their own individual approaches
om buds especially in colleges and universities are still tasked with helping the individual navigate an organization
characterized the om buds as valuable role that om buds continue to play today
journal of the international ombudsman association smith defining the om buds role while neither of these conferences sought to provide singular definition of what campus om buds was there were many examples and thoughts regarding what the role should or could be
if defining and explaining the role of an om buds is difficult today it was significantly more difficult in as the concept had only recently begun to catch on in the united states
early om buds had only governmental models to reference however these early campus om buds had already determined that the classical model was too restrictive and identified need for role more specific to university environment
two definitions are worth reconsidering for the sake of comparison
an explanation of the role was provided by schloss berg in campus ombudsman would be status person possibly legal philosopher attached to the office of the president
members of the campus community who had complaints of any kind could come to him
he would investigate the complaints and if the institution were rong make recommendations for redress
if he saw bottlenecks in the system he would recommend modifications to the system
and as we all know we have model for this in the swedish word and concept ombudsman
this definition outlines campus om buds in the same compare and contrast style to parliamentary models as many contemporary definitions do
it is also unique in the sense that it is largely futuristic outlining what an om buds would or could do as opposed to what they did
in there were only handful of practicing om buds schloss berg was writing for those coming and those working to develop offices
randy hamilton provided contrasting definition of the om buds role
this definition was developed by hamilton walter gell horn donal row at stanley anders en and kenneth culp davis all early om buds scholars over the course of three days an ombudsman can be characterized briefly as high level officer with adequate salary and status free and independent of both the agencies he may criticize and the power that appoints him with long tenure of office sufficient to immunize him from the natural pressures of seeking reappointment with the power to investigate administrative policies on his own notion and this of course is most important
he is unique officer whose sole job is to receive and act upon complaints without charge to the complainant
he should have the power to subpoena records
his principal weapons are publicity and per su as ion criticism and reporting
he does not have the power to punish mal administrators or to reverse administrative decisions hamilton pp
when we compare these various definitions of the om buds we must remember that they were not only pr ovid ed at the genesis of the university om buds but very early on in the life of the american om buds
definition could be applied towards either classical or organizational model
hamilton does not clarify when or why this definition was developed but it is notable in the sense that while north american scholars were grappling with the om buds concept the intellectual forbearers collaborated to develop unified definition of the term
the first om buds in the united states was only es tab lish ed in nassau county new york in and the first university om buds at eastern montana university in the same year smith
when these conferences were coming together in it was novel idea
these definitions although different in many ways contain few similarities one of which is status
the ability to navigate the complex politics and bureaucracy of university environment journal of the international ombudsman association smith required someone who could both earn the respect of students and command the respect of the faculty
add it ion ally they both discuss the power to investigate
as the organizational om buds role evolved this function of the om buds diminished becoming one of the first major distinctions between organizational and classical models
the schloss berg definition is cusses recommendations where the hamilton et al
definition frames it as power to criticize
lastly the hamilton et al definition includes the idea of independence something that will ultimately become cornerstone of the profession
the divergence from parliamentary models the course that the om buds role would ultimately take was set early on by thoughtful practitioners assisted by scholarship rooted in danish models of om buds practice
before the rise of the movement and the alignment of om buds with the field of dispute resolution these authors viewed the role as one to assist individuals to navigate bureaucracy and overcome power imbalances within large organization and ultimately to humanize and empower the individual
as the field lv ed into what we know of today as the organization om buds it would incorporate mediation coaching and other tools into its arsenal and like the university itself reflect corporate and managerial approaches
there are still aspects that set the coll eg and university om buds apart from purely corporate models however and in some aspects college and university om buds may have as much in common with classical models as they do organizational st ie ber
as differences between campus and parlia me nt ary om buds were discussed handful of authors noted that the campus om buds would essentially function differently than classical counterparts
ake sand ler drew distinction between what he called an scandinavian and
sand ler noted that scandinavian models would hold too much power and would threaten the authority of university president
one of the benefits of the om buds model however is that office is so flexible and so adaptable that it can be lit er ally tailored to any specific purpose
the ombudsman is man for all seasons and all sand ler
sand ler noted that in sweden businesses labor and professions all had their own om buds
while the model had not been adopted by du cation at that time in sweden he felt that it was good framework to adopt in the united states
jud son clark also considered differences between university om buds and classical models
there is little biographical information available on clark but presenter at the burling ame conference he served as legislative aide in the state of california during push to create statewide legislative om buds
clark noted both the challenges in passing om buds legislation and those faced by higher education at the time
in both contexts however clark invited participants to consider the reasons for an om buds noting that an individual has the reasonable right to receive fair treatment whether as citizen or as member of university community and that decision arises an choice is usually beyond legal review unless the result is so arbitrary as to constitute clear abuse of discretion
sometimes the greatest discretionary power is exercised when an administrative official simp ly decides to do clark
the role of the om buds in these situations is important regardless of the context
clark also outlined considerations important in adapting the classical model to the university campus including support of he entire university community status accessibility independence and publicity
many of the authors here note that university om buds is fundamentally different than the danish model but they had not yet defined the role out sid of what would eventually become the classical om buds much less in the way that they would eventually come to define an organizational om buds
these gatherings however may be some of the first steps in defining the journal of the international ombudsman association smith field as something unique and dist inc the california caucus of college and university om buds would be established only few years later in and the university and college ombudsman association would be established in
the entablement of these associations signified miles to in the growth of the field as well as highlighted continued differentiations in regional and organizational approaches to the work
cautions against co opting or misappropriating the role participants at both conferences cautioned against at ion of the om buds role or using it as tool to advocate for specific interests on campus
these cautions may at some level foreshadow the complications of the organizational om buds and the needs for the strong professional standards
after con sider ing the various definitions and explanations of the role offered above the fact that the om buds role could be misappropriated is understandable something that early scholars and practitioners saw as an issue on the horizon
randy hamilton issued strong caution against use of the term without full understanding of the practice
caution came in two veins one being the embrace of the om buds bandwagon cautioning institutions implementing om buds positions as well as those individuals who filled the positions to approach the role thoughtfully
the second caution was to warn against practices that co opted the ombudsman term
you want or need power to change grade then you are not an ombudsman
you ay be fulfilling another function which is needed
you may be performing numerous other roles that are necessary but you are not an
in his speech hamilton called out conference participant pointing out that he calls himself an uds man but that clearly was not an ombudsman stating who is here from stockton who introduces himself as an ombudsman is in fact not known as the ombudsman
he is neighbor man for the reasons that he does not have all the characteristics have hamilton
one is only left to wonder whether or not mr had expected this comment or what the reaction was
schloss berg issued similar caution stating strange thing is happening as the concept om bud sm an
before it is translated to education it is becoming
suggestions range from separate ombudsman for each group students faculty administration to committee type ombudsman to combination ombudsman the point here is before we make up scheme and give it the name ombudsman and hope all will be well try to examine some issues study the existing models and develop an educational ombudsman which is fairly true to the original model
argument was that consistent model be developed before the om buds concept spins so far out of control that its differences cannot be rectified and that it remains rooted in scandinavian models
this caution would be echoed by other presenters in both the and conferences
beck also reflected on what other participants had called noting that early scholars and practitioners should be careful about how the om buds is used and that the role should no be established to advocate for specific populations or to serve as lobbyist of sorts
beck noted that it is the role of the ombudsman to serve as an embodiment of the university conscience
the full elimination of conflict is not pos sib le or desirable but we must find the means to contain conflict at levels which are tolerable
if the ombudsman is successful conflict within the university community would usually be contained or journal of the international ombudsman association smith changed and in both cases ultimately make positive contr ib uti on to the individual and to the institution community
beck rooted the om buds role in conflict resolution
this is not to say however that even in the late participants did not see the value of the om buds in terms of social and al justice
benton white at san jose state college is an interesting case in point
position was established in order to out and facilitate the removal of discrimination on the basis of race creed or national origin in whatever areas the college or the college community it may white
the fact that the position at san jose state was one of the first in the country and with this stated mission highlights this point as well as early differentiations in the role
om buds skeptics in addition to cautions issued by om buds there were also those who rejected the very premise of the om buds idea
these were represented by earl clifford whose speech at the conference comparing an om buds to in the fuse box was cited for several years afterwards as the voice of the om buds skeptic
there have not been many opponents who have been as vocal in their opposition to the om buds idea since
speech was impactful as beck later stated hat many participants came away from the conference questioning the idea
the reflection written by kell cher indicates that this skepticism was not confined to just the first om buds meeting
kell cher began his reflection noting the ombudsmen who attended the institute were emphatic in their denunciation of the campus ombudsman as panacea for university problems like patent medicine sold from the back of wagon the ombudsman institute appeared to produce some giddy but no substantial
kell cher concern seems to stem from the idea of an om buds as an easy to an or problems
contemporary om buds practitioners however would likely counter this by agreeing that an om buds annot replace existing processes
these arguments may signal conflict that existed for early om buds and would continue to present an issue when promoting the om buds idea in the future given the nuanced nature of the role
kell cher appeared to embrace some of what was shared by hamilton noting his encouragement to look for patterns and to work towards redress only in the absence of other formal mechanisms for doing so
in this statement however kell cher suggests that om buds the handling of individual problems and their personal ability to through the red in order to redress certain
contemporary om buds may argue that both hamilton and kell cher were both correct in the sense that the role of an om buds is to help visitors to understand and navigate policy and procedure if visitor finds themselves in situation where there are no formal processes to address an issue an om buds may have to make recommendations or clarify any gaps that exist
ultimately it is unclear what kell cher understood an om buds to be or specifically where his opposition to the idea lay
it is possible that some of the participants at the conference also misunderstood what an om buds was however it is important to remember that at th is time there was little in the way of guidance or defining the role of an om buds aside from what has been discussed at these conferences
the skepticism of both kell cher and clifford was likely representative of the skepticism of many upon learning of the om buds idea in the late and the evolution of the field has likely benefitted from the discussions that resulted from this criticism
journal of the international ombudsman association smith what does this document tell us about the foundations of the field
this document takes us to the genesis of the om buds movement in us higher education and within the united states broadly
many of the very first om buds in the united states james rust benton white nelson norman and ake sand ler were together discussing their roles and ideas for what an om buds could or should do in higher education
there were many differing visions presented and in time these mediated one another to shape our conception of the role today
one element that is key to understanding org ani za ti on al om buds is how and why it evolved the way it did
as the organizational model continued to evolve the differences between corporate and university om buds became more apparent and have contributed to tensions in the field overall as leaders have work ed to bridge divides within the practice
college and university om buds historically have not only worked to resolve conflicts but have also served and in many cases continue to serve as bulwark of student and often faculty and staff rights on camp us
considering the nature of the american university and the public good there are elements of the role that align as much with the classical models as with organizational st ie ber
another question that is raised is what the appeal was for earl om buds adopters
while the appeal of an om buds may have been apparent for students as they felt increasingly disconnected from the university and that their rights were unrecognized campus administrators felt that the om buds could stop the disruption
administrators were scared and somewhat desperate
sherman beck in his dissertation reflected upon this element apparent in the san francisco conference the concern about student unrest or ferment took its toll on the effectiveness of the san fra ombudsman conference
most participants seemed concerned about the future of american higher education and students when they are not on the barricades are on pot and on each
ombudsman mania was evident as the participants suggested ti me and time again that the ombudsman system could likely solve the student unrest problem beck
ultimately the era necessitated the need for someone who could engage with students student groups faulty and administration in an in depend way and who could bring them together to overcome the divide that was emerging in the cultural tumult of the time
college and university administrators did not know what to do in response
these conferences were helpful in illuminating the role that an om buds could realistically play
participants likely walked away with greater understanding of the role and its limitations
beck also stated that participants were concerned about current disorders on the campuses across the nation
realization that the ombudsman was not necessarily seemed disconcerting to some
many of the college administrators were in attendance were like men whose homes were on fire and did not have the time or inclination to receive instruction fire
this comment provides some additional insight into what was occurring at the time
although the initial push for an om buds role on campus was in response to what administrators viewed as crisis those scholars and practitioners in attendance were discussing the role as more than that thinking beyond the current state of campus unrest to wards ways to institutionalize the om buds role
journal of the international ombudsman association smith another impetus that can be seen here is the desire to gather and to form associations around the work
the first california caucus of college and university om buds conference was held in
subsequent associations including the university and college om buds association the om buds association and international ombudsman association have also carried on this work
the field of ombudsman dry is rooted in dialogue debate and scholarship
the importance of these practices has not diminished
in order for the om buds profession to continue and thrive opportunities for exchange must be sustained and strengthened
additionally as had been noted the education om buds evolved from classical models
presenters at these early conferences included mix of university om buds scholars and policy experts
this diversity in viewpoint on the om buds strengthened the conversation
while the organizational om buds field has grown and evolved as well as the field of classical om buds each with their own ro fess ion al associations there may be opportunity in continued dialogue across sectors
conclusions and implications for om buds work today the ombudsman in higher education advocate or subversive bureaucrat contains over pages of ideas debate and ia lo gue that took place at the beginning of the om buds movement in the united states
the goal of this paper was to revisit some of these ideas over years later to consider how the om buds role has evolved with time and to further explore the found at io ns of the om buds role
any of the ideas that have shaped contemporary om buds practice are contained germinated at this time and have evolved with the profession
to return to the root of the om buds idea it may be helpful to revisit quote from bu cc ie who authored the first published article about om buds in us higher education
noted in the midst of racial strife in loco parentis rebellion disorientation and expansion there is need for sympathetic listener with powers of ref err al on the campus
each of the five ombudsmen was appointed in response to this need but as result of different problem situations
while the field has evolved and the rest of the world with it the need for sympathetic listener with powers of referral may be more important today than ever
what is apparent from review of this document is that with time and the thoughtful con tri bu ti ons of om buds through the years in various capacities the field has evolved in unique way in order to meet the challenges presented
the om bud man in higher education serves as an important cornerstone in understanding where the om buds field began and it also provides us with way to gauge how much the field has progressed in years
the scholarship and debate demonstrated in this document is astounding especially given the fact that the first university om buds office had been established only few years prior
as the om buds field continues to evolve continued scholarship is more important than ever
there must be continued and dedicated work to both deepen the field and to foster its growth
consideration of the history provides foun dation for dynamic examination of the role and context
